<p>Ortega will receive an honorary doctorate of humane letters during the commencement ceremony for the <a href="https://www.csun.edu/humanities" target="_blank">College of Humanities</a> and <a href="https://www.csun.edu/health-human-development" target="_blank">Health and Human Development</a> on Sunday, May 21 at 8 a.m.</p>

<p>“Rudy Ortega, Jr., Charles Yu and Milt Valera are outstanding leaders in their careers and in their communities and we are so proud to honor their contributions in this way,” said CSUN President Erika D.

<p>Ortega is the elected leader of the Fernandeño Tataviam Band of Mission Indians (FTBMI) and his ancestors come from the villages that originated in the geographical areas of Santa Clarita, Simi and San Fernando Valleys. His dedication to tribal affairs began as a child while shadowing his father, the late Tribal Chairman Rudy Ortega, Sr. He was first elected Vice President for the FTBMI at the age of 18.</p>
<p>Through this role, Ortega continued efforts of the tribe’s mission to protect the rights of Fernandeño Tataviam as Native Americans. He assisted in the reinvigoration of the tribe’s non-profit, Pukúu Cultural Community Services, to provide community programs to Native Americans living in Los Angeles County, as well as to sustain the Fernandeño Tataviam community. Through Pukúu, Ortega also oversees the Haramokngna American Indian Cultural Center.</p>
<p>As Tribal President, Ortega works with local and state governments and the California Historical Commission on policies to protect and enhance tribal resources and ancestral territory. He was instrumental in negotiating the repatriation of tribal remains in Angeles National Forest and in securing traditional land in LA County for future tribal burials.</p>
<p>He was appointed to CSUN’s Commission on Diversity in 2022 and is integral to the cultural fabric of the university, raising awareness for Native students and Native communities and providing blessings at important university events. Ortega&#8217;s leadership is also helping to create partnerships with CSUN’s academic community focused on climate resiliency, internships, non-profit incubators and teacher training,</p>

<p>Yu is an acclaimed television screenwriter and award-winning author of four books, including &#8220;Interior Chinatown,&#8221; which explores the stereotypes of Asian Americans in Hollywood and in American culture more broadly. “Interior Chinatown” won the 2020 National Book Award for fiction, was shortlisted for the Le Prix Médicis étranger and longlisted for the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction.</p>
<p>He received the National Book Foundation’s 5 Under 35 Award and was nominated for two Writers Guild of America Awards for his work on the HBO series, Westworld. He has also written for shows on FX, AMC, Facebook Watch, and Adult Swim. His fiction and non-fiction have appeared in a number of publications including The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, The Atlantic, Wired, Time and Harper’s.</p>
<p>Yu is a graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, where he majored in molecular and cellular biology and minored in creative writing. He obtained his law degree from Columbia Law School. Yu worked as an associate at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell and Bryan Cave as a corporate attorney, as the director of business affairs at Digital Domain, and as an associate general counsel at Belkin International before becoming a full-time fiction and TV writer.</p>
<p>Together with TaiwaneseAmerican.org, he established the Betty L. Yu and Jin C. Tu Writing prizes in honor of his parents.</p>
<div class="mceTemp">Born and raised in Lihue, Hawaii, Valera earned his journalism degree from CSUN in 1968 before forming his own public relations and marketing agency. He would later work exclusively for the National Notary Association and become the association&#8217;s CEO and president in 1982. Valera revolutionized the profession by introducing comprehensive educational initiatives, creating special publications and authoring rules of ethical and professional conduct that serve as the foundation for notary best practices in the U.S. today.</div>

<p>As an alumnus and volunteer leader at CSUN, Valera serves on boards of the CSUN Foundation, The Soraya, and the Mike Curb College of Arts, Media, and Communication and served on the Campaign Leadership Committee for the university. He was honored with volunteer service awards from the Alumni Association Journalism Chapter in 2003 and University Advancement in 2005. In 2011, he received the Dorothea “Granny” Heitz Award for Outstanding Volunteer Leadership, and in 2019, he was recognized with the university’s Distinguished Alumni Award.</p>
<p>Valera and his wife, Debbie, are also longtime supporters of CSUN. Together they have committed more than $11 million for programs across the campus, particularly those that support students who have been part of the foster care system. In 2020, in recognition of the Valeras’ transformative gift, CSUN’s administration building was renamed Valera Hall.</p>
<p>The Valeras’ are also active supporters of K-12 education, and in 2019, the Sun Valley Valera Middle Academy was named in honor of their investment to support the educational success of public-school students in under-resourced communities.</p>

<p>To better understand the war, a discussion on the ongoing struggle and its significance to the survival of Ukrainian culture will take place at California State University, Northridge on Tuesday, April 25, from 6-8 p.m. in the Ferman Presentation Room of the University Library, located in the center of the campus at 18111 Nordhoff Street.</p>
<p>The discussion, “<a href="https://library.csun.edu/events/spotlight-ukraine?type=event" target="_blank">Spotlight on Ukraine-History, Politics, and the Path Forward</a>&#8220;, will include a live presentation and consist of first-person accounts by a Ukrainian family who recently left their war-torn nation and immigrated to California. This event is sponsored by the Friends of the University Library and free and open to the public.</p>
<p>A summary of the history of Russian-Ukrainian political and cultural conflicts over the last several decades leading to the present conflict will be given by CSUN history professor Donal O’Sullivan, who regularly teaches classes in Russian and German history.</p>
<p>O’Sullivan won the CSUN Distinguished Teaching Award in 2009 and the College Teaching Fellowship in 2012. His dissertation was on Soviet policy in Eastern Europe and the Western response, while his next book was “Dealing with the Devil: Anglo-Soviet Intelligence Co-Operation During the Second World War.”</p>
<p>Ukrainian couple Dmytro and Nataliia Chyrkin will also discuss their departure from their home city of Odessa, their perilous journey undertaken separately with their two children and reuniting in Germany before coming to America.</p>
<p>“The war in Ukraine is one of the most crucial geo-political events in the world today,” said Mark Stover, Dean of the University Library. “I’m looking forward to hearing from our panel of experts who will discuss the ongoing crisis. I anticipate that the panelists will share important insights and perspectives, providing a valuable forum for discussion and debate on this pressing issue.”</p>
<p>A Q&amp;A will follow the panel discussion and will be moderated by Robert Gohstand, geography professor emeritus.</p>
<p>This public event will be held in the university library’s Ferman Presentation Room on April 25 from 6–8 p.m. The library is located in the center of the campus at 18111 Nordhoff Street.</p>
<p>To register to attend the event, visit <a href="https://library.csun.edu/events/spotlight-ukraine?type=event">library.csun.edu/events/spotlight-ukraine</a> or call (818) 677-2638.</p>
<p>Requests for accommodation services must be made at least five business days in advance. Email library.event@csun.edu in advance of the event.</p>

		</p><div id="attachment_52306" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-52306" src="https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/wp-content/uploads/Nic-Harcourt-Photo-4-web.jpg" alt="Nic Harcourt" width="300" height="450" srcset="https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/wp-content/uploads/Nic-Harcourt-Photo-4-web-200x300.jpg 200w, https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/wp-content/uploads/Nic-Harcourt-Photo-4-web.jpg 427w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Nic Harcourt</p></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">His voice has helped define the morning and the music tastes of thousands of radio listeners in Southern California and around the world.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Nic Harcourt, who has been described by music writers as “the most influential DJ in America,” marks his 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary on the region’s radio airwaves this month, and his colleagues at <a href="https://www.thesocalsound.org">88.5-FM, The SoCal Sound</a>, are celebrating.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Nic Harcourt is a regional treasure,” said Patrick Osburn, general manager of 88.5-FM, Southern California’s leading triple-A (adult album alternative) rock station. “Nic has always been an expert and wonderful advocate for public/member-supported radio. We are very fortunate to have him.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Harcourt, who has been called by members of the news media as an ultimate “tastemaker” in music, started his tenure on Southern California’s airwaves in 1998 at Santa Monica-based public radio station KCRW. For the past 10 years, he has been hosting the morning drive time at 88.5-FM and, since 2020, “The Morning Show with Nic Harcourt and Jet.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Nic Harcourt is as passionate as ever,” said Marc “Mookie” Kaczor, 88.5-FM’s program director and the SoCal Sound’s evening DJ. “Nic is a great broadcaster, music journalist and mentor. This radio station has hit milestone after milestone, and Nic has been an integral part of 88.5’s growth.”</p>
<p>Born in Birmingham England, Harcourt’s life and travels took him all over the world before he landed at WDST in Woodstock, New York, where he served as show host, news and music director, and program director.</p>
<p>His next stop was KCRW where he spent a decade as the music director and host of “Morning Becomes Eclectic” before going, 88.5-FM in 2012.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Harcourt’s innovative efforts have transformed radio, whether it’s live video sessions of performances in a station’s studio or being the first public radio broadcaster to hit the road with live radio and video performances from CMJ in New York, South by Southwest in Texas and the BBC’s legendary Maida Vale studios in London, and the first public radio programmer to champion Latin alternative music. He has also provided music supervision on numerable television shows and hosted 100 episodes of the interview/music performance show “Guitar Center Sessions’ on DirecTV.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times has called him “the country’s most important disc jockey.” The Wall Street Journal has said “Harcourt hosts the most interesting and influential radio shows in the U.S.” He is widely credited with launching the careers of Adele, Coldplay, The Black Keys, M.I.A., Norah Jones, Florence and The Machine, Arcade Fire and countless others.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to his work with KCSN and KCRW, Harcourt has served as music and culture editor for the Los Angeles Times Magazine and was MTV’s first music supervisor in residence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Coincidentally, Harcourt’s 25<sup>th</sup> year celebration comes the week of April 17, during 88.5-FM, The SoCal Sound’s April membership drive.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve worked around 60 pledge drives through the years,” Harcourt said. “They’re an opportunity to connect directly with the audience, a crucial part of keeping public media in business, and an incredibly important part of the gig. Don’t tell anybody, but I actually enjoy them”.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">88.5-FM, The SoCal Sound, is a combined effort of California State University, Northridge (CSUN) and Saddleback College, which began simulcasting as 88.5-FM in October 2017, linking the Los Angeles County- and Orange County-based signals. The station’s Triple-A programming is available on the KCSN and KSBR 88.5 HD1 channels, via the 88.5 app and online at <a href="http://www.thesocalsound.org/">www.TheSoCalSound.org</a>.</p>

		</p><p>Making change through nonviolent protest has always been the way for civil rights leader, and longtime CSUN lecturer, the Rev. James M. Lawson Jr. On March 28, Lawson, who was recently named a Distinguished Scholar at CSUN, shared that philosophy and how it applies today with a large audience at the USU Grand Salon.</p>
<p>Lawson, who worked with Martin Luther King Jr. during the civil rights movement, spoke about the ongoing culture of violence in America and how it damages our ability to create community with others.</p>
<p>Students and faculty, along with CSUN President Erika D. Beck and other campus leaders, attended his talk, titled ‘Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?’ which was based on his recently published book &#8220;<a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520387843/revolutionary-nonviolence" target="_blank">Revolutionary Nonviolence: Organizing for Freedom.</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>“We, the people of the United States of America — we have become the most violent society in the history of the human race,&#8221; Lawson said. &#8220;[In part} because we think that violence is the power that brings changes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lawson, who spoke a day after three children and three adults were killed in a shooting at a private school in Nashville. said that life should be seen as a precious gift, and showed how that view can bring a community together.</p>
<p>“Chaos is the way of disobedience to being alive,” he said. “Community is seizing hold of life and following its course. Violence results in people pulling away from each other, rather than being drawn to respect and serve each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Near the end of the lecture, audience members were given a chance to ask Lawson questions. One student asked Lawson for ways to try to reach people who won&#8217;t listen to different views — or views that oppose their own beliefs.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a nonviolent tactic that is very successful, Lawson said. &#8220;That nonviolent tactic is a face-to-face. A one-on-one. To go to the person and encourage them to have a large general conversation about life, about who they are and where they&#8217;re going&#8230; and be guided by a sense that this person is the human being who can be encouraged to move themselves in the direction of change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lawson was first introduced to the philosophy of change through nonviolence while he was a college student. He followed the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi, the leader of the Indian independence movement. He became a colleague of Martin Luther King Jr. during the 1960&#8217;s and the fight for civil rights.</p>
<p>Lawson has taught on theories and practices of nonviolence at CSUN since 2010, as part of the Civil Discourse and Social Justice initiative. It is a program dedicated to promoting ideas of community involvement, as well as social and justice related activism in combination with education. Lawson&#8217;s work with the initiative includes workshops, courses and other public discussions. Currently he teaches the Civil Discourse and Social Justice upper division communication studies course in the Mike Curb College of Arts, Media, and Communication.</p>

<hr />
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Deciding where a family member should go and the type of care they should receive towards the end of their life involves a myriad of often heart-wrenching decisions that can have lasting emotional impact long after the person has died.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">California State University, Northridge <a href="https://www.csun.edu/humanities/religious-studies">religious studies</a> professor Claire White said this is particularly true for people from underserved populations or who are highly religious. These individuals, she said, are less likely to seek hospice care — which focuses primarily on individual comfort and making a dying person’s remaining time as meaningful as possible.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“People from underserved populations and highly religious individuals are more likely to die in an intensive care unit (ICU) when they have a terminal illness like cancer than their counterparts in better served communities or than those who are less religious,” said White, who teaches in CSUN’s <a href="https://www.csun.edu/humanities">College of Humanities</a>. “The reason that this is a problem is that when people die in ICU care, they typically have higher levels of physical pain and psychological distress. We also know that family members suffer poorer adjustment following the loss of a loved one than when a terminally ill loved one dies in hospice care”.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The question is why?” White said. “Why are underserved populations and highly religious individuals more likely to die in ICU care than hospice care? And why do their family members suffer worse adjustment after the loss of their loved one?”</p>
<div id="attachment_52246" style="width: 360px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-52246" src="https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/wp-content/uploads/End-of-life-team--300x217.jpg" alt="Members of the CSUN team doing research on end-of-life care in Los Angeles.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">To answer those questions, White has assembled a team of 24 graduate and undergraduate students from a variety of disciplines at CSUN to study these disparities in end-of-life care for underserved populations in Los Angeles. The researchers are investigating how key psycho-social factors, including religious and spiritual beliefs, impact medical-decision making by family members of terminally ill patients. Among those decisions are whether the dying family member should receive hospital or hospice care and whether care should be curative interventions or palliative focused.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This month, the student researchers are reaching out to family members across Los Angeles to ask them about what factored into their decisions about end-of-life care for their loved ones.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Most of the research that currently exists focuses on end-of-life care for the dying individuals,” White said. “I am really focused on the people who are left behind and how they cope following the death of a loved one.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re conducting semi-structured interviews with family members who have lost a loved one due to terminal illness in the past 12 months in Los Angeles,” White said. “The study is really locally focused, and it’s locally focused because we need to be contextually sensitive—the problems we have Los Angeles may not necessarily be the problems that other parts of the United States are facing, or even, other parts of the world.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">White said some of questions use standardized measures of grief and coping, but others are open-ended, such as “What (if any) role did spirituality/religion play for you in deciding the type of care your family member should receive?” The students will also ask questions about what influenced end-of-life care decisions, including questions about practical considerations such as finances, trust in medical professionals, religious/spiritual beliefs, and values related to death and dying.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To prepare for the interviews, the student researchers received two days of intensive training from a licensed clinical social worker and will take part in bi-weekly support meetings.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While White does not know what the study will find, she believes that it may dispel assumptions about ethnic groups and their religious beliefs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The existing literature has made assumptions that lump diverse groups together,” she said. “I think there are going to be differences in the factors that influence different kinds of groups, among those is cultural values.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hospice workers and grief counselors have told White about the important role cultural values play in end-of-life decisions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“And that’s what we are focusing on in this research,” she said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">White is curious to see how cultural values intersect with socio-economic status.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I have heard stories from Latino family members who felt that not putting their loved one into hospice care was giving up hope for the family unit,” she said. “I have also heard from a low-income African American family member that her father provided the only source of income. In that case, he refused to go into hospice care because it would mean a loss of his valued role as the breadwinner of his family.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The socio-economic barriers may intersect in interesting ways with cultural values,” she continued. “And that&#8217;s something I think that we&#8217;re really missing. Some existing research assumes that the reason that underserved groups and highly religious individuals go to ICU care is because they want aggressive interventions; and the reason they want aggressive interventions is because there&#8217;s hope for a miracle. I think that&#8217;s an overly simplistic way of reasoning about groups that are not white, upper- or middle-income class, which is the population most of the other research has looked at. These are the assumptions we&#8217;re trying to test and challenge.”</p>

<hr />
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As the climate got colder and colder about 25,000 years ago during the coldest phase of the last Ice Age known as Last Glacial Maximum, the prehistoric hunter-gatherers who populated much of what we now know as Europe fled south.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">An international research team that includes California State University, Northridge <a href="https://www.csun.edu/social-behavioral-sciences/anthropology">anthropologist</a> Hélène Rougier have dispelled some preconceptions about the modern humans who are, at least partially, the ancestors of Western Eurasia by analyzing genetic material from bone fragments and piecing together clues from tools and other debris found during archeological excavations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s long been an assumption, even in the scientific communities, that the early modern humans who lived before the Last Glacial Maximum were genetically connected,” said Rougier, who teaches in the <a href="https://www.csun.edu/social-behavioral-sciences/departments-special-programs-centers">College of Social and Behavioral Sciences</a>. “However, the populations from western and southwestern Eur0pe — the areas we now call France and Iberia — differed genetically from contemporaneous populations from central and southern Europe — today’s Czech Republic and Italy. What makes this even more interesting is that, while they were not genetically connected, it appears that they did share culture. They used similar weapons and produced similar portable art.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">“As hunters and gatherers, they were nomadic and traveled around to find food, probably on a seasonal basis,” she said. “But as the climate got colder and food became scarce and the land uninhabitable, they were forced to move to areas where they were more likely to survive; similar to stories we are beginning to hear today from regions of the world facing severe impact from modern climate change.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“As these early Europeans traveled, they crossed paths with other modern humans and spent time together long enough, they socialized long enough, that they were able to share their culture,” Rougier said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The findings, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05726-0">Palaeogenomics of Upper Paleolithic to Neolithic European hunter-gatherers</a>,” appeared in the journal Nature.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Rougier is one of 125 researchers from around the world working together for more than a decade to explore prehistoric life in Europe, hoping to gain perspective on what human life was like before recorded history. Their disciplines span the spectrum, from biological anthropology and archaeology to biochemistry and genetics. Rougier said the interdisciplinary approach provides an opportunity to bring new perspectives and raise questions that individuals in a particular specialty may not consider or be able to resolve.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an invigorating and exciting approach,” she said. “And when we release a study, you can be assured that is has been vetted from all angles.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">By working together, the researchers found that populations from different regions associated with what is called the Gravettian culture, which was widespread across the European continent between 32,000 and 24,000 years ago, were not closely related to each other. Gravettian hunters made spears to kill wooly mammoths and other big game. They also made figurines that might have represented fertility.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers demonstrated that descendants of populations associated with the Gravettian culture stayed in southwestern Europe during the coldest parts of the last Ice Age, and later spread northeastward to the rest of Europe.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Italian peninsula has long been considered to be another climate refuge for humans during the Last Glacial Maximum. However, the research team found no evidence of this. Hunter-gatherer populations associated with the Gravettian culture and living in central and southern Europe are no longer genetically detectable after the Last Glacial Maximum. People with a new gene pool settled in these areas, instead.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe these people came originally from the Balkans, and then spread south to what we now call Sicily,” Rougier said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The analyzed genomes also show that the descendants of these inhabitants of the Italian peninsula spread across the rest of Europe about 14,000 years ago, replacing populations associated with the Magdalenian culture, which dates from about 19,000 to 14,000 years ago.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Rougier said the research team believes this large-scale genetic replacement may have been caused, in part, by climatic changes that forced people to migrate.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“This is something to think about as we deal with the impact of our current climate crisis,” she said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The findings also showed that there had been no genetic exchange between contemporaneous hunter-gatherer populations in western and eastern Europe for more than 6,000 years. Interactions between people from central and eastern Europe can only be detected again from 8,000 years ago.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is so much that we are learning as we work together to analyze the data and ask each other questions that we might not have considered if we weren’t working with people from a variety of disciplines,” Rougier said. “When we put all the data from the different fields together, we can really produce studies like this one, which shed new light on assumptions we had taken for granted. While my geneticist colleagues did much of the work on this study, it was very nice to be able to integrate archaeology with their efforts to try to identify who these people were and really try to retrace population histories and migration interactions, and the link with climate change.”</span></p>

		</p><p>Students, faculty and staff celebrated the culmination of CSUN&#8217;s Black History Month with a festive gala, Feb. 28 in the University Student Union&#8217;s Northridge Center. The party, complete with dinner and a talent show, capped more than a dozen programs throughout the month, highlighting the contributions of Black Americans and African Americans.</p>
<p>Gala tables were decorated with vibrant batik prints and strewn with buttons with quotes from famous Black leaders. Brightly colored balloons decorated the room and posters focused on famous acts of resistance — the theme of this year&#8217;s Black History Month. CSUN President Erika D. Beck gave an opening address, noting the very appropriate theme for Northridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the 1960s, students here at Cal State Northridge have been engaged in being part of the solution by resisting the status quo. By resisting underrepresentation, resisting marginalization, resisting exclusion and demanding change,&#8221; Beck said.</p>
<p>She noted the protests on campus more than 50 years ago, known as &#8220;The Storm at Valley State,&#8221; that led to significant changes on campus — including the creation of what is now known as Africana Studies, as well as Chicana/o Studies and expansion of the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP).</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot more work to do,&#8221; Beck said, &#8220;and I am tremendously grateful to be part of this academic community, joined by all of you, the leaders we need to co-create a future where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Together, we stand unwavering in our commitment to accelerating authentic equity across every dimension of identity and lived experience.”</p>
<p>A talent show featuring singing and spoken-word performances by students, faculty and alumni was a highlight of the evening. Ellisa McKissic, a graduating senior in cinema and television arts, served as one of the student emcees. She told the audience how much she appreciates the sense of community created by the faculty and staff in the Department of Africana Studies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m appreciating how much it takes to actually matriculate all the way through and how much support, guidance and love that all of us are getting from the Africana Studies department,&#8221; McKissic said.</p>
<p>Campus events celebrating Black History Month included film screenings, musical performances and lectures, as well as moderated discussions with Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones and hip-hop pioneer Grandmaster Melle Mel.</p>
<p>Departments, student organizations and clubs across campus organized the events in honor of Black History Month, said Marquita Gammage, Africana Studies department chair. Black history, she said, should be taught all year long.</p>
<div class=""><span class="">&#8220;It&#8217;s a great opportunity to learn American history, world history, and to really understand African Americans and African people&#8217;s contributions to the world, because Black history is world history<b class="">,&#8221;</b> Gammage said.</span></div>
