I won&#8217;t rehash the details here, but I did want to point out that this is why developers should remember to follow these two rules of defensive programming:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sanitize inputs as early as possible</li>
<li>Sanitize outputs as late as possible</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case, there was a failure to follow the first rule. There are a couple of different places where this could have been handled better.</p>
<p>For one, unless there is a good reason to allow <strong><code>GET</code></strong> or <strong><code>POST</code></strong> variables to override a URL placeholder parameter, then that should be handled appropriately. If there is a reason for it, then those values should be forced to comply with the regular expression or data type that is expected.</p>
<p>The other failure, beyond simple sanitizing, is that the logic of the <strong><code>update_item_permission_check()</code></strong> method simply didn&#8217;t properly account for the failure to retrieve a valid result from <strong><code>get_post()</code></strong>. This function will return post data either as an object or an array (depending on parameters), or <strong><code>null</code></strong> upon failure. The logic of the first conditional was looking for a valid post <em>and</em> invalid permissions on the post as an error condition:</p>
<pre><code>if ( $post &amp;&amp; ! $this-&gt;check_update_permission( $post ) ) {
    return new WP_Error( 'rest_cannot_edit', 
        __( 'Sorry, you are not allowed to edit this post.' ), 
        array( 'status' =&gt; rest_authorization_required_code() ) );
}</code></pre>
<p>Instead, it should have reversed the valid post logic, and looked for <em>not</em> a valid post, <em>or</em> invalid permissions:</p>
<pre><code>if ( <strong>! $post ||</strong> ! $this-&gt;check_update_permission( $post ) ) {
    return new WP_Error( 'rest_cannot_edit', 
        __( 'Sorry, you are not allowed to edit this post.' ), 
        array( 'status' =&gt; rest_authorization_required_code() ) );
}</code></pre>
<p>And for good measure, it should probably check whether the return value was an instance of <strong><code>WP_Error</code></strong>, for future-proofing. This small change would have detected an invalid post ID, and still performed a valid permissions check for existing posts.</p>
<p>Okay boys and girls, let&#8217;s say it all together now&#8230; &#8220;Security is hard.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TL;DR: If you use the php-ssh2 extension for your WordPress core / theme / plugin updates, you might want to wait a little longer before upgrading to PHP 7.</p>
<p>Last month, one of my VPS servers suffered a catastrophic disk failure, taking down several personal websites that my wife and I manage. All of our WordPress content is on a separate database server, so the main content is still intact. I&#8217;ve also been able to extract a <em>few</em> things from a raw image of the damaged drive.  But there were some things (site-specific plugins, child-themes, media content, utility scripts, my email archives) which are likely gone for good, or that will at least be painful to put back into place (uploaded images, etc.).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not much use crying over spilt milk, though, so I at least saw this as an opportunity to freshen up and improve upon my previous server configuration. In its previous incarnation, I had been running Apache workers, and PHP-FPM (PHP 5.6.x). But I also had some web experiments in Nodejs, which I had to run on a non-standard port, so as to not conflict with Apache. Since I was starting from scratch anyways, I&#8217;ve decided to put HAProxy in front of everything, so that I can internally run multiple web servers, and just proxy to them transparently. And while I was at it, I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot of good things about the speed improvements in PHP 7, so I figured I&#8217;d upgrade that, as well.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into the nitty-gritty details of my install (especially since I&#8217;m not finished yet), but I did want to let others know about a problem I&#8217;ve run into: There is a new development build of the php-ssh2 extension for PHP 7, but it is not quite complete yet. Many things do work, but unfortunately, all of the functions which rely on the ability to use the <code>stat()</code> call are broken at this time. This includes other file-checking functions such as <code>is_dir()</code>, and <code>is_file()</code>, <code>file_exists()</code>. In WordPress, if you are using the SSH2 filesystem class (rather than FTP or FTPS), this will prevent you from using the built-in plugin and theme installers, or any of the automatic upgrade functionality.</p>
<p>After digging around in the php-ssh2 extension source code for a while and comparing to a previous version, I was unable to find the problem myself. My C programming is too rusty, and I just don&#8217;t have the time to start learning PHP and libssh2 internals from scratch. But, I did <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71376">file a bug on the PHP Bugtracker</a>, and the author of the PHP 7 port of the php-ssh2 extension has said that he is working on a fix. So keep an out out for an update on that.</p>
<p>Just as a side-note, using fstat() on a filehandle opened on an ssh2.sftp file resource, or using the ssh2_sftp_stat() call do work. But that doesn&#8217;t help with the is_dir() and is_file() calls which are failing in the class-wp-filesystem-ssh2.php code. Those functions rely on the PHP internal ssh2.sftp stream wrappers.</p>
<p>Postscript: I know plenty of people will say, &#8220;You should have had backups!&#8221; or even, &#8220;Your VPS host must suck for not having backups!&#8221;. The former is absolutely true &#8212; I should have done better at backing up some of the things that I did not have backups for. The VPS host is not really to blame. I had gotten a disk size upgrade, and I actually had an opportunity to request a snapshot of my system before I ran the upgrade process to extend my disk. But because I had run it successfully on another server without incident, I got careless. And after the upgrade, the system seemed to run fine for about three weeks before any problems surfaced.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2016/01/18/wordpress-php7-and-updates-via-php-ssh2/">WordPress, PHP7, and Updates via php-ssh2</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dougal.gunters.org">Dougal Campbell's geek ramblings</a>.</p><div class='yarpp yarpp-related yarpp-related-rss yarpp-related-none yarpp-template-list'>

Pantheon provides a scalable web platform with devops-friendly dashboards and tools for deployment and management.</p>
<blockquote><p>The first and most obvious thing we did was ensure the platform was WordPress-friendly. This is the only piece of work that wasn’t on our roadmap already, but luckily it wasn’t very hard. The requirements for running Drupal vs. WordPress are quite similar.</p>
<p>The upside is that WordPress developers can expect tuned and friendly configurations for php, nginx, Varnish, mysql and Redis, with a stock set of Plugins to make the most of everything the platform has to offer.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="https://www.getpantheon.com/blog/wordpress-developers-rejoice-pantheon-has-your-back">WordPress Developers Rejoice! Pantheon Has Your Back</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, Pantheon already had a CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool called Terminus for managing services, which they originally implemented as a drush extension (drush is the &#8220;drupal shell&#8221;, a CLI for Drupal). In modifying their platform for WordPress support, they rewrote it as a stand-alone tool, borrowing a lot of ideas from wp-cli in the process.</p>
<blockquote><p>We actually borrowed quite a lot from the wp-cli toolkit in this refactor. Our library code was largely portable from Drush, but we took their object structure and docstring-parsing magic, which is pretty strong stuff. As a result, we have a more robust CLI tool to build off in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested, <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com/pricing">they offer a free account</a> to let you check things out (no custom domain on the free level). Paid offerings begin at just $25/month.</p>
<p>(I have no affiliation with Pantheon, if anyone is wondering)</p><p>The post <a href="https://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2014/03/19/pantheon-platform-adds-wordpress-support/">Pantheon Platform Adds WordPress Support</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dougal.gunters.org">Dougal Campbell's geek ramblings</a>.</p><div class='yarpp yarpp-related yarpp-related-rss yarpp-related-none yarpp-template-list'>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently ran across an issue that I was previously unaware of, so other developers could run into it as well. I was having problems with a plugin, which started misbehaving. The plugin had previously worked fine (it generates a sidebar widget), and I wasn&#8217;t actively working on my site, so I wasn&#8217;t really sure when it had quit working.</p>
<p>In the course of debugging the problem, I discovered that the plugin was throwing warnings in my PHP error log regarding the <code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code> function. As a quick fix, I simply replaced all of those calls with WordPress&#8217; <code>esc_sql()</code> function. Voila, problem fixed.</p>
<p>Curious, I took a peek into <code>wp-db.php</code>, and found this block of code:</p>
<pre><code>
/* Use ext/mysqli if it exists and:
 *  - USE_EXT_MYSQL is defined as false, or
 *  - We are a development version of WordPress, or
 *  - We are running PHP 5.5 or greater, or
 *  - ext/mysql is not loaded.
 */
if ( function_exists( 'mysqli_connect' ) ) {
        if ( defined( 'USE_EXT_MYSQL' ) ) {
                $this-&gt;use_mysqli = ! USE_EXT_MYSQL;
        } elseif ( version_compare( phpversion(), '5.5', '&gt;=' ) || ! function_exists( 'mysql_connect' ) ) {
                $this-&gt;use_mysqli = true;
        } elseif ( false !== strpos( $GLOBALS['wp_version'], '-' ) ) {
                $this-&gt;use_mysqli = true;
        }
}</code></pre>
<p>Note the bit about using a development version of WordPress. In my case, I&#8217;m running out of svn trunk, and my server has the <code>mysqli</code> extension installed, so <code>wpdb</code> chose to use it. That&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>But this exposes the fact that some plugins use functions like <code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code> &#8220;in the raw&#8221;, so to speak, which depends on using PHP&#8217;s <code>mysql</code> extension, and not <code>mysqli</code>. WordPress provides convenience functions like <code><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/esc_sql">esc_sql</a>()</code> and <code><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/wpdb#Protect_Queries_Against_SQL_Injection_Attacks">$wpdb-&gt;prepare()</a></code> to help abstract details like this away and protect developers against environmental differences between servers.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will save somebody else out there some debugging time.</p><p>The post <a href="https://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2014/03/06/mysql-vs-mysqli-wordpress/">mysql vs mysqli in WordPress</a> first appeared on <a href="https://dougal.gunters.org">Dougal Campbell's geek ramblings</a>.</p><div class='yarpp yarpp-related yarpp-related-rss yarpp-related-none yarpp-template-list'>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in March of 2013, I gave a presentation at WordCamp Atlanta titled &#8220;Secure All The Things&#8221;. I&#8217;ve just noticed that <a title="Secure All The Things!" href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/10/26/dougal-campbell-secure-all-the-things/">the video of this presentation</a> finally went up on<a href="http://wordpress.tv/"> wordpress.tv</a> a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>At the time of the WordCamp, I had been really busy at work, so I hadn&#8217;t had as much time to rehearse or revamp my slide deck as I had wanted. Despite that, I feel like the talk went off pretty well, especially about halfway in, when I started fielding questions from the audience. I was able to relax more when I was answering questions than when I was concerned about remembering which slide was coming up next.</p>
<p>Towards the very end, I realized that we were coming up against the session&#8217;s time limit, so I hurried through the last few slide points. But overall, I felt like it went pretty well.</p>
