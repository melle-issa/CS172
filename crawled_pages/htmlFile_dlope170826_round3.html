	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2023/03/dolphy/">With WordPress 6.2 released</a>, this exploration seeks to explore the Site Editor as a design tool, asking folks to create a <span tabindex='0' class='glossary-item-container'>block<span class='glossary-item-hidden-content'><span class='glossary-item-header'>Block</span> <span class='glossary-item-description'>Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience.</span></span></span> theme without any code directly in the editor using the current tools. The aim is to both find gaps in functionality and to get feedback on the experience of using the Site Editor in this design centric way, as we look to expand the number of block themes. </p>



<p>The focus of this exploration is to think with a more open minded, “what can I build today?” approach. If you’ve never built a block theme, consider this an invitation to give it a try. Tooling has come a long way and the power of what’s being built is that it allows more folks to dive into the future (and present) of WordPress.<strong> </strong>For this experience, you’ll use the Create Block Theme <span tabindex='0' class='glossary-item-container'>plugin<span class='glossary-item-hidden-content'><span class='glossary-item-header'>Plugin</span> <span class='glossary-item-description'>A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party</span></span></span> to facilitate the creation and export process so you can keep what you create! <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/tools-resources/#block-themes">Feel free to read these brief instructions</a> for how to get started or follow the steps below.</p>



<p>In the near future, expect a more formal call for testing once more, dedicated to some of the newer functionality being worked on as <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/02/04/phase-2-finale/">part of the remaining major phase 2 items</a>. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exploration Instructions</h2>



<p><strong>To use a prebuilt test site: </strong></p>



<ol><li>Open this link only once: <a href="https://app.instawp.io/launch?t=fse-block-theme-exploration&amp;d=v1">https://app.instawp.io/launch?t=fse-block-theme-exploration&amp;d=v1</a>  Please do not repeatedly open this link as it creates a new site each time.</li>



<li>This will launch a site for you to use for up to 5 days. </li>



<li>Save the link to your site so you can access it again during the test. </li>
</ol><p><strong>To set up your own test site: </strong></p>



<ol><li>Have a test site using the latest version of WordPress. It’s important this is not a production/live site. </li>



<li>Install and activate the Create Block Theme plugin.</li>



<li>Install and activate <span tabindex='0' class='glossary-item-container'>Gutenberg<span class='glossary-item-hidden-content'><span class='glossary-item-header'>Gutenberg</span> <span class='glossary-item-description'>The Gutenberg project is the new Editor Interface for WordPress. The editor improves the process and experience of creating new content, making writing rich content much simpler. It uses ‘blocks’ to add richness rather than shortcodes, custom HTML etc. <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/</a></span></span></span> 15.4 (or the latest version). </li>
</ol><p><strong>Create the base of your theme</strong></p>



<ol start="4"><li>Navigate to Appearance &gt; Create Block Theme.</li>



<li>Choose either “Create blank theme” to start completely from scratch or you can use the currently active block theme by choosing the “Clone” option. Note: You are welcome to use a block theme of your choosing if you Clone!</li>



<li>Fill out the information for either option. Feel free to keep this pretty simple since this is just for testing and not official block theme launching purposes. When done, select “Generate”.</li>



<li>Head to Appearance &gt; Themes and activate the theme you just created.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Configure your fonts</strong></p>



<ol start="8"><li>Head to Appearance &gt; Manage Theme Fonts.</li>



<li>From here, you can add a Google font or a Local font if you have any you’d like to use. This will install the fonts (download them) as part of the theme but these fonts still need to be applied. </li>



<li>Once added, you can then manage the font weights. </li>



<li>After you’re done, head to Appearance &gt; Editor and open Styles to configure these fonts for use on your theme under Typography. </li>
</ol><p><strong>Make your changes and export</strong></p>



<ol start="12"><li>Head to Appearance &gt; Editor and begin customizing as you’d like! </li>
</ol><p>Here are some high level ideas: </p>



<ul><li>Use the Styles interface to make global changes to the Layout, Typography, and more. Use the Stylebook to see your changes at a glance to individual blocks. </li>



<li>Use the design tools built into each block to make individual changes. </li>



<li>Create new templates or template parts. </li>



<li>Add or remove different blocks from current templates or template parts. </li>
</ul><p><strong>Export your theme</strong></p>



<ol start="13"><li>When you’re done making your changes, head to Appearance &gt; Create Block Theme.</li>



<li>From there, choose the “Export” option. This option will automatically include user changes so you don’t have to overwrite them first.</li>
</ol><h3 class="wp-block-heading">Please share feedback by April 26th, 2023</h3>



<p><strong>What to notice</strong></p>



<p>While you’re welcome to share feedback on any aspect of the experience, here are a few specific questions to focus your feedback. </p>



<ul><li>Did the experience crash at any point?</li>



<li>Did the saving experience work properly? </li>



<li>What did you find particularly confusing or frustrating about the experience?</li>



<li>What did you especially enjoy or appreciate about the experience? </li>



<li>What did you need to use Custom <span tabindex='0' class='glossary-item-container'>CSS<span class='glossary-item-hidden-content'><span class='glossary-item-header'>CSS</span> <span class='glossary-item-description'>CSS is an acronym for cascading style sheets.

I appreciated the generator's simple setting options, which didn't overwhelm me with too many choices, as I am still learning the many elements of theme.json. The generated theme only consisted of an index template without any template parts, but its theme.json had automatically enabled useRootPaddingAwareAlignments, which allowed full-width sections\/elements to be stretched outside of the group\u2019s constraint. During the building process, I used the overwrite function of Create Block Theme (CBT) to save all the changes to the theme.json file to make it the single source of truth for the final theme.\n\nSince I'm not a designer but would love to have a proper spacing layout, good hierarchy of headings, and a harmonious color palette, I then copied some of those elements from a couple of themes. For spacing values (spacing.spacingSizes and styles.spacing.blockGap), I copied them from the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/wpengine\/frost\/blob\/trunk\/theme.json\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Frost theme<\/a> and adopted the predefined font size values of headings & paragraphs from the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/andersnoren\/beaumont\/blob\/main\/theme.json\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Beaumont theme<\/a>.

So my theme doesn't use custom CSS anymore.\n\nFor this theme, I created the following templates & template parts:\n\nTemplates:\n1. Home template\n2. Single template\n3. Page template\n4. No Title (custom template, need to be manually registered in theme.json)\n5. Category template\n\nTemplate parts:\n1. header (applied to single & page templates)\n2. footer (applied to single & page templates)\n3. centered-header-with-logo (applied to home template)\n4. left-aligned-footer (applied to home template)\n5. post-meta (applied to single template)\n\nFor font, I used Inter variable font Inter-VariableFont_slnt,wght.ttf which I uploaded using Create Block Theme plugin.\n\nOne particularly confusing or frustrating about the experience is when using CBT to overwrite some templates (front page, home, custom template). I summarized the process in the following steps.\n\n<ol>\n<li>Adding Custom template named Home<\/li>\n<li>Overwrote the theme via CBT.

Although the errors didn't fail the overwriting process.\n\n( ! ) Warning: rename() expects parameter 1 to be a valid path, object given in ...\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php on line 147\n\n( ! ) Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at ...\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php:147) in ...\\wp-admin\\includes\\misc.php on line 1431\n\n( ! ) Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at ...\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php:147) in ...\\wp-includes\\functions.php on line 6896\n\n( ! ) Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at ...\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php:147) in ...\\wp-admin\\admin-header.php on line 9\n\nInterestingly, I found the above problem does not happen if I added and overwrote single or page templates via CBT.\n\nBesides templates, I experimented with pattern creation. With the help of <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/pattern-manager\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pattern Manager plugin<\/a>, I managed to copy one of the core\u2019s patterns named Quote and renamed it as quote-with-circle-image.php.

Copying the required images to the said folder solved the problem. Learning from this, I wondered if the image copying could be done during the CBT overwriting process and whether the overwriting process of templates that used core\u2019s patterns could output the result to the HTML template only instead of the HTML + PHP pattern to minimize confusion.\n\nFor the interested folks, I put the codes <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/franzaurus\/nocode-gen\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>, and the resulted live site <a href=\"https:\/\/bbt.dwrf.my.id\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here<\/a>.","contentFiltered":"<p>I started exploring <span tabindex=\"0\" class=\"glossary-item-container\">block<span class=\"glossary-item-hidden-content\"><span class=\"glossary-item-header\">Block<\/span> <span class=\"glossary-item-description\">Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor.

The following error messages appears after the overwriting process and the referenced image disappeared.<\/p>\n<p>( ! ) Warning: rename() expects parameter 1 to be a valid path, object given in \u2026\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php on line 147<\/p>\n<p>( ! ) Warning: rename() expects parameter 1 to be a valid path, object given in \u2026\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php on line 147<\/p>\n<p>( ! ) Warning: Cannot modify header information \u2013 headers already sent by (output started at \u2026\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php:147) in \u2026\\wp-admin\\includes\\misc.php on line 1431<\/p>\n<p>( ! ) Warning: Cannot modify header information \u2013 headers already sent by (output started at \u2026\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php:147) in \u2026\\wp-includes\\functions.php on line 6896<\/p>\n<p>( ! ) Warning: Cannot modify header information \u2013 headers already sent by (output started at \u2026\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php:147) in \u2026\\wp-admin\\admin-header.php on line 9<\/p>\n<p>After examining the troubled templates and patterns, I found that the image path was going to the theme\u2019s root assets\/images folder.

I  bolded my comments for the items to save time reading.\n\nI used my own WP install and imported posts from another Exploration, and created a few pages.\n\nThese are some of the changes made:\n1. Started with \"Create blank theme\" in Create Block Theme plugin.\nOver the week or so that I worked, both Gutenberg and CBT plugin updated, so there were changes to some things while I worked.<strong> ( I like the link to Global Styles in the Appearance > Editor menu.)<\/strong>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Added 2 Google Fonts - Lora and Open Sans and used Global Style to add them to Text and Headings. <strong>This worked really well (as long as CBT plugin \"knows\" the theme.)<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n2a. Added four additional colors to the basic WP color palette.\n\n<ol>\n<li>Edited the Layout widths in GS, but this time I left the Block Spacing at the default 24px because I had issues previously. <strong>I'll try editing it again later, as I think I found what was not working for me, and it wasn't the actual Block Spacing.<\/strong><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Edited the Buttons Block <strong>(I find it a bit odd to have some of the Button styles with the Global Typography and Colors, and then again down below in the Blocks, but I guess I don't have a suggestion, as many people would just want to change button colors and typography, and not padding or spacing , etc.)<\/strong><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Edited the Quote Block to make the typography larger.<strong> (I also tried to add Custom CSS for the size of the \"cite\" but it didn't change, and it had in an earlier test, so I must have different selectors, and will track it down later.)<\/strong><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>After that I worked on editing the Header and  Footer. I named the first Group in each under the HTML Element to be<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><\n\nheader> and\n\n<\n\nfooter> respectively. <strong>I think that CBT plugin should already have them named with these HTML elements.<\/strong>\n\nFor the header, I uploaded a logo and removed the Site Title and Tag line and edited the menu in the header and not over in the Navigation, although they both changed. I added a bottom border and made the max width of the inner Row to be my wide width.\n\nI did similar to the footer for the width. I added a Row with the copyright and the Login\/Out, reduced the top spacer size and added a top border.\n<strong>I did not try to create a new Header\/Footer at this time.<\/strong>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Changes to index.html were to put the Query Loop in a Group Block with the HTML Element <main> and add top and bottom padding.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Created a new Page Template using the Index to start. Removed the Query Block and added a Post Title and Post Content to the Group Block with <main> from step 7.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Next I added a Custom Template - Page with No Title based on the Page Template and removed the Post Title.\nI created a \"Front Page\"  in Pages > Add New and used this Template for it. <strong>I've used a Front Page Template in the past, and that's what I would normally do, but tried something different.<\/strong><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Next was the \"Single Item: Post\" template baed on Index again. I added Post Title, Post Content, Featured Image and copied the Row Block from the  Query Loop with the Post Author, Date, Cats, and Tags (just to save time). And deleted the Query Loop.  I added a Comments Block. <strong>No issues with that.<\/strong><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Then I exported the theme using CBT plugin.\n<strong>All of that went well.<\/strong><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>I duplicated the site, activated the Twenty Twenty-Two theme, and deleted the original theme that I had from CBT plugin that came along with the cloned site.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>I imported the theme I created with the CBT plugin and activated on the second site. <strong>And it all went really well, and looked exactly the same.<\/strong><\/p><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p><strong> I also made a small edit to the Page Template with no issues.\nAnd created a new header template part to use only with the Page template. I used one of the available header patterns. That also worked with no issues.\nAnd also made some other changes.<\/strong>\n<strong>I hope to also try using it on a different site that is not a clone of the site I used to build the theme.<\/strong>\n\n<strong>Additional Comments:<\/strong>\n1. I like the direct link to \"Styles\" from Appearance > Editor.\nAlthough at times, I still don't \"see\" that I am in Global Styles when I want to be in the Template or Block Styles.

Here goes:\n\nI created a new site via instawp, created a new empty block theme. That worked great.\n\nI uploaded one font (it was a google font which I had downloaded previously). The font-weights were correctly recognized. \nWhen I saved and returned to the previous screen a \"System font\" was added as well. How would I go about specifying a fallback font? Eg I normally use \"Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif\" as fallbacks for font-family - I guess this is only possible via custom CSS?\n\nFor the first time ever I opened the theme editor. I expected to see the right sidebar (InspectorControls) open instantly, but I first had to click in the site to open it. I opened global styles and started to style my site.

Same for the defaults of Padding, Margin, Block Spacing and similar items.\n\nWhen arranging the site title and site tagline next to each other with the Row variation, there's no setting for the CSS property <code>align-items<\/code>, which with the value <code>baseline<\/code> would allow the smaller site tagline to be nicely aligned with the site title. I can add an extra class for this and it works in the backend, but in the frontend my class is overwritten by the default <code>is-layout-flex<\/code> class, which has <code>align-items: center<\/code>.

How would I go about specifying a fallback font? Eg I normally use \u201cHelvetica, Arial, sans-serif\u201d as fallbacks for font-family \u2013 I guess this is only possible via custom CSS?<\/blockquote>\n\nAsked here: https:\/\/github.com\/WordPress\/gutenberg\/issues\/45271#issuecomment-1521619384 You can set this via theme.json manually but I want to see if it's done automatically when uploading fonts.\n\n<blockquote>Styling buttons (the block and elements) is split into \u201ctypography\u201d and \u201ccolors\u201d. This hierarchy may make sense and it\u2019s a way how many plugins in the past implemented in the customizer. Still another way may be \u201cI want to style buttons, now show me all controls to style buttons\u201d. At the moment one has to go into typography for text and then into color for colors.<\/blockquote>\n\nEdited to add your feedback to a current issue on exactly this topic around the information architecture. Thanks so much:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/WordPress\/gutenberg\/issues\/47369#issuecomment-1518729328\n\n<blockquote>Top level color styles: I\u2019m assuming this is styles \u201celements\u201d and the text above (\u201cdifferent global elements on the site\u201d) confirms that. I can\u2019t define hover\/focus styles for buttons \u2013 which I would have to do via CSS.<\/blockquote>\n\nThat's correct right now! There's an effort to bring this into the Site Editor here: https:\/\/github.com\/WordPress\/gutenberg\/issues\/38277\n\n<blockquote>Top level typography styles: The icons for the different entries sometimes communicate current state (eg the background color on the button item), but other settings (eg removing text-decoration underline from link) does not change that. So the list is kind of mixed of current styles and base-styles. The text Aa icon seems to have a different font (the one i defined?) than heading and captions (allthough heading \/ captions do inherit that font).<\/blockquote>\n\nI'll include this in the usability feedback of the recap post. I don't think we'll end up having it be a perfect 1:1 reflection but I think it's worth mentioning. Right now, the main way we do this for individual blocks at least is through this preview mechanism or the style book: https:\/\/github.com\/WordPress\/gutenberg\/issues\/42919\n\n<blockquote>When I open the styles for specific blocks and style the button block, the slider for its border radius is set to 0 although it has a border-radius (coming from core styles I guess). I have to move the slider up and down to get it to become 0.<\/blockquote>\n\nExcellent feedback. This relates to the broader experience here: https:\/\/github.com\/WordPress\/gutenberg\/issues\/43082 I'll note it in the recap!\n\n<blockquote>In the storybook the text blocks do not contain any links.

Thanks so much for yet another contribution to the outreach program. It's always helpful to get your detailed insights.\n\n<blockquote>With the Create Blocks theme creating a completely blank theme, I had the issue of finding why the header was full width and the footer was not, and specifically finding the block that had the full width assigned.<\/blockquote>\n\nI'm curious what you think but, rather than opening an issue, this feels related to a different request to have empty templates when starting out: https:\/\/github.com\/WordPress\/create-block-theme\/issues\/80 This would allow you to set what you want rather than wrestling with what's there. Let me know though if you'd prefer an issue is created to make both full width.\n\n<blockquote>What I found confusing is that for typography, there\u2019s the preset font sizes (S, M, L, XL) but there\u2019s no interface to change those preset sizes globally from the editor. Same for the defaults of Padding, Margin, Block Spacing and similar items.<\/blockquote>\n\nNoted here: https:\/\/github.com\/WordPress\/gutenberg\/issues\/43443#issuecomment-1525687396\n\n<blockquote>When arranging the site title and site tagline next to each other with the Row variation, there\u2019s no setting for the CSS property align-items, which with the value baseline would allow the smaller site tagline to be nicely aligned with the site title. I can add an extra class for this and it works in the backend, but in the frontend my class is overwritten by the default is-layout-flex class, which has align-items: center. In the backend, the order of the classes is correct, while in the frontend the custom classes load too early and are overwritten by the WP default classes, so I have to use !important here.<\/blockquote>\n\nI'm going to chat with some of the experts working on Layout here as I'm not sure if it makes the most sense to open a new issue for this, note it as general usability feedback, or comment on a current issue. I'll loop back here either way and include it in the recap.\n\n<blockquote>For the social icons block, it would be nice to have an exact size adjustment like for fonts, instead of just \u201cSmall\u201d, \u201cNormal\u201d, \u201cLarge\u201d and \u201cHuge\u201d.<\/blockquote>\n\nNoted here on a related issue: https:\/\/github.com\/WordPress\/gutenberg\/issues\/39467#issuecomment-1527740221\n\n<blockquote>I had adjusted the font size under Styles -> Typography -> Text to be higher than the default one, however it would not apply to all blocks in the content. I had to manually update Post Date, Categories and Tags. For the Post Author and Post Content blocks changing the font size to a custom of 21px did not have any effect on the block. For the post content block, the font size is set at the surrounding div, but does not apply to the paragraph child elements, as there\u2019s a default CSS p { font-size: 16px }, which came from a the font size setting in the Paragraph block, as I found out after some testing. I wonder where the 16px from came from, either from the Create Block Theme or some default setting in WP?<\/blockquote>\n\nNoted here on a related issue: https:\/\/github.com\/WordPress\/gutenberg\/issues\/45086#issuecomment-1527745839 with this issue looking into possible ways of showing the \"levels\" of styles: https:\/\/github.com\/WordPress\/gutenberg\/issues\/49278\n\n<blockquote>For the Pagination blocks, it would be great if the next Next Post and Previous Post could be changed to something else.<\/blockquote>\n\nNoted here on a related issue about expanding the options of these blocks: https:\/\/github.com\/WordPress\/gutenberg\/issues\/49266\n\n<blockquote>I chose a Google Font at the exact step in the instructions and it worked fine. When I wanted to change the font later on, I can add new fonts to WP through the \u201cManage Theme Fonts\u201d page, however the newly fonts there don\u2019t show properly (they are added, but the font always falls back to the default system serif font).

<p>Switching a Header Template. What about using the Transform To menu to switch a Reusable block to another Reusable block, and one type of pattern with another similar type. Be it Header, Footer etc. Being able to easily transform from one type of Header pattern to another.</p>
<p>How do I keep the Footer on the bottom of the page independent of how much content is on the page/post?</p>

I thought that adjusting the content in here would adjust the post content, well add additional post content to all pages. It did not show up that way.</p>
<p>Apply globally.<br />
I have a specific header that I want to add to all templates. I also have a specific footer that I want to add to all templates. It looks like I can apply globally a specific Group which will be added to other Group blocks.</p>

<p>Yes! These two issues touch on exactly that:</p>

<a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/44582" rel="nofollow ugc">https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/44582</a></p>
<p>Also noting that you can use the “replace” option to do that for template parts! I’ve added a comment to this issue open about moving that “replace” option to the transform menu:</p>

<blockquote><p>How do I keep the Footer on the bottom of the page independent of how much content is on the page/post?</p></blockquote>
<p>Check this out: <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/06/minimum-height-dimensions-block-support/" rel="ugc">https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/06/minimum-height-dimensions-block-support/</a></p>
<p>“The feature allows users to set a Group or Post Content block to have a minimum height, similar to the control that exists for the Cover block. An example use case is to ensure that a post content area has a minimum height, forcing a footer area to render lower on the page, even if a page has little content. For this reason, it can be quite useful to use viewport relative units when setting minimum height, e.g. 100vh for a block that takes up the entire height of the viewport.”</p>
<blockquote><p>The Post Content block.<br />
In the Page Template I changed the text inside the Page Content block and expected to see the text added to all the pages, but it was only added to the front page. There is obviously something I am missing here…</p></blockquote>
<p>In watching your video, I see you paused and then restarted recording after making some unknown changes there: <a href="https://youtu.be/tniEqn9q0fk?t=1556" rel="nofollow ugc">https://youtu.be/tniEqn9q0fk?t=1556</a> I <em>think</em> what you did is somehow edit the post content block placeholder text.  I am not sure how you did that though 😀 This doesn’t change the functionality of the block which is to display the post/page content. Can you clarify what you did there?</p>
<blockquote><p>I add a Header pattern and now I have one official Header template part where I see it has the Header template part label.<br />
The other newly added Header pattern does not have the Header template label but is in a Row. How do I make the new pattern become the Header template part?</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah when you added in a header pattern, it didn’t automatically convert to a header template part block. Instead it remained as a pattern. This comes up as part of this problem:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/41397" rel="nofollow ugc">https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/41397</a></p>

I am going through your excellent feedback.</p>
<p>A few additional comments.<br />
Minimum height is very helpful, but it will not keep the footer sticked/fixed to the bottom of the viewport in the browser. It would be helpful to have the footer fixed to the bottom of the screen.

I am drawing a blank on this one. As I removed the test site and took it back to an earlier stage I was not able to replicate this issue. I will need to come back to this on at a later stage.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi Anne,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for taking the time to read through my article and getting back to me. I am glad it may help in the recap.</p>
<p>In response to intrinsic design, I am all for it but even then I believe responsive control will still be needed in certain situations. Every page builder and website building tool out there offers this feature, so I don’t think WordPress can do without it just yet. One basic example is simply having control over how the columns collapse down from desktop &gt; tablet &gt; mobile. For example, you might want columns to collapse 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 1 or 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 2. Currently you’d have to hack the <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">CSS<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">CSS</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">CSS is an acronym for cascading style sheets. This is what controls the design or look and feel of a site.</span></span></span> to do this.</p>
<p>Regarding overriding <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">block<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Block</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor.

It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML.</span></span></span>, you are absolutely correct that it is in fact possible. I was following an issue on <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">github<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">GitHub</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">GitHub is a website that offers online implementation of git repositories that can easily be shared, copied and modified by other developers.

I have just updated the issue to include the solution thanks to you pointing me in the right direction:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/34853" rel="nofollow ugc">https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/34853</a>. I will also update my guide and remove that from the limitations section and over to the golden nuggets section 🙂</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thanks for following up and for updating your guide! It’s incredibly helpful to have folks like yourself sharing more broadly.</p>
<blockquote><p>One basic example is simply having control over how the columns collapse down from desktop &gt; tablet &gt; mobile. For example, you might want columns to collapse 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 1 or 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 2. Currently you’d have to hack the <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">CSS<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">CSS</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">CSS is an acronym for cascading style sheets.

<p>Agreed. I think there will need to be a bit of both, depending. Ideally, we can fit as much as possible intrinsically! For good measure, an issue related to your example: <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40870" rel="nofollow ugc">https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/40870</a></p>
<p>Also, since this is your first contribution to the FSE Outreach Program, expect a Test Contributor badge on your <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">WordPress.org<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">WordPress.org</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">The community site where WordPress code is created and shared by the users.

			<div class="comment-content"><p>I started exploring <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">block<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Block</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience.</span></span></span> themes building using Carolina Nymark’s No-Code <a href="https://fullsiteediting.com/block-theme-generator/" rel="nofollow ugc">theme generator</a> as a starting point, and then built upon it in the Site Editor. I appreciated the generator’s simple setting options, which didn’t overwhelm me with too many choices, as I am still learning the many elements of theme.<span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">json<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">JSON</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a minimal, readable format for structuring data. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML.</span></span></span>. The generated theme only consisted of an index template without any template parts, but its theme.json had automatically enabled useRootPaddingAwareAlignments, which allowed full-width sections/elements to be stretched outside of the group’s constraint. During the building process, I used the overwrite function of Create Block Theme (CBT) to save all the changes to the theme.json file to make it the single source of truth for the final theme.</p>
<p>Since I’m not a designer but would love to have a proper spacing layout, good hierarchy of headings, and a harmonious color palette, I then copied some of those elements from a couple of themes. For spacing values (spacing.spacingSizes and styles.spacing.blockGap), I copied them from the <a href="https://github.com/wpengine/frost/blob/trunk/theme.json" rel="nofollow ugc">Frost theme</a> and adopted the predefined font size values of headings &amp; paragraphs from the <a href="https://github.com/andersnoren/beaumont/blob/main/theme.json" rel="nofollow ugc">Beaumont theme</a>. As for the color palette, I sought a monochromatic color scheme, which I generated from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_monochromatic.asp" rel="nofollow ugc">W3School’s color schemes.</a></p>
<p>I previously wrote custom <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">CSS<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">CSS</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">CSS is an acronym for cascading style sheets.

So my theme doesn’t use custom CSS anymore.</p>
<p>For this theme, I created the following templates &amp; template parts:</p>
<p>Templates:<br />
1. Home template<br />
2. Single template<br />
3. Page template<br />
4. No Title (custom template, need to be manually registered in theme.json)<br />
5. <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">Category<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Category</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">The 'category' taxonomy lets you group posts / content together that share a common bond.

<p>One particularly confusing or frustrating about the experience is when using CBT to overwrite some templates (front page, home, custom template). I summarized the process in the following steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding Custom template named Home</li>
<li>Overwrote the theme via CBT. Noticed that it created wp-custom-template-home template instead of home. I understand that this problem has been reported, and I have commented on the issue there <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/create-block-theme/issues/184#issuecomment-1442778292" rel="nofollow ugc">https://github.com/WordPress/create-block-theme/issues/184#issuecomment-1442778292</a> </li>
<li>Renamed wp-custom-template-home.<span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">html<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">HTML</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a markup language that is used in the development of web pages and websites.</span></span></span> to home.html via Visual Studio Code.</li>
<li>Adding a block paragraph and cover block</li>
<li>Overwrote the theme via CBT</li>
<li>The blocks codes are now saved to home.html</li>
<li>Now add a pattern from <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">core<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Core</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress.</span></span></span>’s pattern collections.</li>
<li>Overwrote the theme via CBT</li>
<li>Observe how the home.html now consists only a reference to home.php pattern in which the blocks code are now reside.</li>
<li>Upon editing the home template, the image referenced in the pattern is gone. Attempting to recover the block effort is failed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The aforementioned problem also happened if I added and overwrote a front-page template, but without the template renaming effort (it correctly named front-page.html), but there were some additional error messages showed up. Although the errors didn’t fail the overwriting process.</p>
<p>( ! ) Warning: rename() expects parameter 1 to be a valid path, object given in …\wp-content\plugins\create-block-theme\admin\create-theme\theme-media.php on line 147</p>
<p>( ! ) Warning: Cannot modify header information – headers already sent by (output started at …\wp-content\plugins\create-block-theme\admin\create-theme\theme-media.php:147) in …\wp-admin\includes\misc.php on line 1431</p>

<p>Interestingly, I found the above problem does not happen if I added and overwrote single or page templates via CBT.</p>
<p>Besides templates, I experimented with pattern creation. With the help of <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/pattern-manager/" rel="nofollow ugc">Pattern Manager plugin</a>, I managed to copy one of the core’s patterns named Quote and renamed it as quote-with-circle-image.php. The process went smoothly until I inserted the pattern at the home template and overwrote the theme using CBT. The following error messages appears after the overwriting process and the referenced image disappeared.</p>
<p>( ! ) Warning: rename() expects parameter 1 to be a valid path, object given in …\wp-content\plugins\create-block-theme\admin\create-theme\theme-media.php on line 147</p>

<p>After examining the troubled templates and patterns, I found that the image path was going to the theme’s root assets/images folder. Copying the required images to the said folder solved the problem. Learning from this, I wondered if the image copying could be done during the CBT overwriting process and whether the overwriting process of templates that used core’s patterns could output the result to the HTML template only instead of the HTML + <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">PHP<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">PHP</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php">http://php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php</a>.</span></span></span> pattern to minimize confusion.</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Thank you for the detailed notes, it’s very helpful for debugging!</p>
<p>Regarding your experience using CBT:</p>
<p>Steps 1 – 3 should be addressed by this recent addition to <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">Gutenberg<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Gutenberg</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">The Gutenberg project is the new Editor Interface for WordPress.

<blockquote><p>
  I found that the image path was going to the theme’s root assets/images folder. Copying the required images to the said folder solved the problem.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This sounds like an issue with CBT that I’m trying but can’t quite replicate. It’s peculiar that it only happens with the home template as well. Which pattern did you add? May I also ask some details about your environment — operating system, WordPress, and <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">plugin<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Plugin</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website.

</p></blockquote>
<p>If the template contains media, the content of the template is automatically moved to a pattern in order to serve the assets locally when the theme is exported / used in another site or environment.</p>
<p>There is a good case to be made that overwriting the theme should not necessarily trigger this feature to move the template contents to a pattern. I opened an issue <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/create-block-theme/issues/333" rel="nofollow ugc">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for opening an issue for my suggestion.</p>
<p>My testing environment includes Windows 11, WordPress 6.2, Create <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">Block<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Block</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor.

<p>I understand that the export function is made to serve the theme portability. However, after exploring further, I find that there is different behavior when exporting via CBT or natively in the Site Editor. For this test, I used the Quote pattern that was inserted into a front page template.</p>
<p>If exported via Site Editor.<br />
The process only creates front-page.<span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">html<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">HTML</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language.

The image is served online (from <a href="http://s.w.org" rel="nofollow ugc">http://s.w.org</a>).<br />
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/bbgD2gU.png" rel="nofollow ugc">https://i.imgur.com/bbgD2gU.png</a></p>
<p>If exported via Create Block Theme.<br />
The process creates the following files:<br />
1. assets/images/portrait.jpg<br />
2. front-page.php<br />
3. front-page.html<br />
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/mzafq6L.png" rel="nofollow ugc">https://i.imgur.com/mzafq6L.png</a></p>
<p>The resulting theme from both methods can be used on another site. The failure only happen if the overwrite function is selected during theme development. The previous error messages will show up, and the images will disappeared. This is because, during overwriting, Create Block Theme does not copy the required images to the assets/images folder.<br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/F3ceXjx.png" rel="nofollow ugc">https://i.imgur.com/F3ceXjx.png</a><br />
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/bfEYWvu.png" rel="nofollow ugc">https://i.imgur.com/bfEYWvu.png</a></p>
<p>IMHO, I still think having fewer theme files (the Site Editor export method) and locally serving the theme’s assets (inside the assets/images folder) would make a good theme in terms of size, maintainability and privacy issues.<br />
Thanks 🙂</p>

If I’m counting correctly, this is your fourth contribution to the FSE Outreach Program. I appreciate your consistent feedback.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since I’m not a designer but would love to have a proper spacing layout, good hierarchy of headings, and a harmonious color palette, I then copied some of those elements from a couple of themes. For spacing values (spacing.spacingSizes and styles.spacing.blockGap), I copied them from the Frost theme and adopted the predefined font size values of headings &amp; paragraphs from the Beaumont theme. As for the color palette, I sought a monochromatic color scheme, which I generated from W3School’s color schemes.</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Added 2 Google Fonts – Lora and Open Sans and used Global Style to add them to Text and Headings. <strong>This worked really well (as long as CBT plugin “knows” the theme.)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>2a. Added four additional colors to the basic WP color palette.</p>
<ol>
<li>Edited the Layout widths in GS, but this time I left the Block Spacing at the default 24px because I had issues previously. <strong>I’ll try editing it again later, as I think I found what was not working for me, and it wasn’t the actual Block Spacing.</strong></li>
<li>
<p>Edited the Buttons Block <strong>(I find it a bit odd to have some of the Button styles with the Global Typography and Colors, and then again down below in the Blocks, but I guess I don’t have a suggestion, as many people would just want to change button colors and typography, and not padding or spacing , etc.)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edited the Quote Block to make the typography larger.<strong> (I also tried to add Custom <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">CSS<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">CSS</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">CSS is an acronym for cascading style sheets.

It can influence a visitor’s opinion about your content and you/ your organization’s brand. It may also look different on different screen sizes.</span></span></span> and  Footer. I named the first Group in each under the <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">HTML<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">HTML</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a markup language that is used in the development of web pages and websites.</span></span></span> Element to be</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&lt;</p>
<p>header&gt; and</p>
<p>&lt;</p>
<p>footer&gt; respectively. <strong>I think that CBT plugin should already have them named with these HTML elements.</strong></p>
<p>For the header, I uploaded a logo and removed the Site Title and <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">Tag<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Tag</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">Tag is one of the pre-defined taxonomies in WordPress. Users can add tags to their WordPress posts along with categories. However, while a category may cover a broad range of topics, tags are smaller in scope and focused to specific topics. Think of them as keywords used for topics discussed in a particular post.</span></span></span> line and edited the menu in the header and not over in the Navigation, although they both changed. I added a bottom border and made the max width of the inner Row to be my wide width.</p>
<p>I did similar to the footer for the width. I added a Row with the copyright and the Login/Out, reduced the top spacer size and added a top border.<br />
<strong>I did not try to create a new Header/Footer at this time.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Changes to index.html were to put the Query <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">Loop<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Loop</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">The Loop is PHP code used by WordPress to display posts. Using The Loop, WordPress processes each post to be displayed on the current page, and formats it according to how it matches specified criteria within The Loop tags. Any HTML or PHP code in the Loop will be processed on each post. <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop">https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop</a>.</span></span></span> in a Group Block with the HTML Element <main> and add top and bottom padding.</main></li>
<li>
<p>Created a new Page Template using the Index to start. Removed the Query Block and added a Post Title and Post Content to the Group Block with <main> from step 7.</main></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next I added a Custom Template – Page with No Title based on the Page Template and removed the Post Title.<br />
I created a “Front Page”  in Pages &gt; Add New and used this Template for it. <strong>I’ve used a Front Page Template in the past, and that’s what I would normally do, but tried something different.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next was the “Single Item: Post” template baed on Index again. I added Post Title, Post Content, <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">Featured Image<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Featured image</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">A featured image is the main image used on your blog archive page and is pulled when the post or page is shared on social media. The image can be used to display in widget areas on your site or in a summary list of posts.</span></span></span> and copied the Row Block from the  Query Loop with the Post Author, Date, Cats, and Tags (just to save time). And deleted the Query Loop.  I added a Comments Block. <strong>No issues with that.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then I exported the theme using CBT plugin.<br />
<strong>All of that went well.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I duplicated the site, activated the Twenty Twenty-Two theme, and deleted the original theme that I had from CBT plugin that came along with the cloned site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I imported the theme I created with the CBT plugin and activated on the second site. <strong>And it all went really well, and looked exactly the same.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> I also made a small edit to the Page Template with no issues.<br />
And created a new header template part to use only with the Page template. I used one of the available header patterns. That also worked with no issues.<br />
And also made some other changes.</strong><br />
<strong>I hope to also try using it on a different site that is not a clone of the site I used to build the theme.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Comments:</strong><br />
1. I like the direct link to “Styles” from Appearance &gt; Editor.<br />
Although at times, I still don’t “see” that I am in Global Styles when I want to be in the Template or Block Styles. I don’t have any suggestions at this time; I think it’s a matter of getting used to what I see.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I would like the CBT plugin to add HTML Elements to the templates and parts that it creates (unless WordPress is moving away from using them.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ll have to try CBT plugin starting with another Block Theme to see if it helps more with development.<br />
I’ve been starting themes with the <a href="https://fullsiteediting.com/block-theme-generator/" rel="nofollow ugc">Theme Generator on Full Site Editing</a><br />
And then editing theme.<span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">json<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">JSON</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a minimal, readable format for structuring data. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML.</span></span></span> directly, especially for the block styles.<br />
I hope to use Global Styles more for this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall, it think that CBT plugin works really well for creating a new blank theme, adding Google Fonts, and exporting a theme that can be used  on another site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One other thing I noticed when I was changing Templates on a page is that my choices were “Default Template” and “Page No Title”.<br />
I’m not sure I like the use of “Default Template”.  Yes, the Page Template is the default template for a Page, but I’d like to see what it is.<br />
At first glance, I thought it was trying to use Index, and that Page Template was missing.</p>

It’s really helpful to have a sense of what you explored and the path you followed so, while I might not comment on as much since items don’t necessarily need the same kind of follow up, know I’m appreciative and will incorporate what you shared in the write up.</p>
<blockquote><p>( I like the link to Global Styles in the Appearance &gt; Editor menu.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Agreed! I’ll note this as usability feedback.</p>
<blockquote><p>(I find it a bit odd to have some of the Button styles with the Global Typography and Colors, and then again down below in the Blocks, but I guess I don’t have a suggestion, as many people would just want to change button colors and typography, and not padding or spacing , etc.)</p></blockquote>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi team!<br />
It’s my first contribution in this area, but I hope to do many more why I love to create webs with blocks 💪</p>
<p>I did previously a <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">Block<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Block</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience.</span></span></span> Theme with code and created some sections with the Site Editor and copy/paste the code. But this advance is grateful! It’s incredible, can create a Block Theme no writing any code 🙌</p>
<p>Regarding my experience creating the Block Theme following these instructions. I create a theme from a Create blank theme option.</p>
<p><strong>Configure fonts</strong><br />
When I tried to add Theme Fonts, I arrived to a page where I can view the preview of the fonts, but I was searching how work why it was confuse to me. I think that in this point, it is necessary in the first once a wizard, similar to the editor. Here a screenshot<br />

<p>In this steep, also I detect this message:<br />

<p><strong>In the Editor </strong><br />
When I entered the Editor, it appears a lot of time the spinner, but don’t load anything. With the inspector, I detected that I had duplicate content (the <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">URL<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">URL</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">A specific web address of a website or web page on the Internet, such as a website’s URL www.wordpress.org</span></span></span> <a href="http://test-fse.soivigol.dev/?_wp-find-template=true" rel="nofollow ugc">http://test-fse.soivigol.dev/?_wp-find-template=true</a>) that was loaded from a domain without <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">HTTPS<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">HTTPS</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">HTTPS is an acronym for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure.

No problem for me why I review the console.log, but if some user has the same problem, I think should show a notice about this problem (or others similar). But, leaving the spinner without response is confused or frustrating.</p>
<p>When I had inserted a menu, appear a new item ( Navigation) in the Navigation <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">Sidebar<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Sidebar</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">A sidebar in WordPress is referred to a widget-ready area used by WordPress themes to display information that is not a part of the main content.

Now, when I click in “Save” button, I have the option to save data of the Logo and Icon. If I click, I get an error. Here a screenshots. I had reload the page to continue.<br />

I modified the default color palette, for example, in the Luminous Vivid Orange I modified this color to #FFAF76, but when I install in other installation how a new theme, the color is restored to default. Is this feature normal? I don’t know, but I hoped to export all colors modified.</p>

<p>No. It was casual. I explain better this point.<br />
I did the test on my own server.

When I went to the WordPress Dashboard, I entered with HTTPS (by the redirection).

I think that the people will have the HTTPS activated, but if someone doesn’t have it, will have this error. I tried again reproduce this issue and follow passing.<br />
I created another test installation to try with HTTP in the settings but with the HTTPS in the URL, and I obtain the same issue.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for clarifying this! Makes perfect sense. In this case, I’m going to hold off on opening an issue for now. It’s not necessarily something that can be fixed in the editor and it’s tricky to properly identify the exact problem. I’m going to double check this thinking with a few folks though to be safe and note it in the recap as well.</p>

<p>Got it! To make sure I understand, you first created a blank theme. You made color changes and exported the theme using the Site Editor’s export tool rather than the CBT plugin. This didn’t keep your color changes when you installed the theme on a new site. However, when you used the CBT plugin and used the export functionality, the color changes were kept. Is that correct? Thanks for going back and forth with this on me!</p>

			<div class="comment-content"><p>So, that’s my first time using FSE/the theme editor (since I normally build custom themes) – so take everything I say with a grain of salt, since I’m probably thinking about it more in terms of a developer and maybe not a site builder and maybe some things are out of scope of this outreach. Here goes:</p>
<p>I created a new site via instawp, created a new empty <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">block<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Block</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience.</span></span></span> theme. That worked great.</p>
<p>I uploaded one font (it was a google font which I had downloaded previously). The font-weights were correctly recognized.<br />
When I saved and returned to the previous screen a “System font” was added as well. How would I go about specifying a fallback font? Eg I normally use “Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif” as fallbacks for font-family – I guess this is only possible via custom <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">CSS<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">CSS</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">CSS is an acronym for cascading style sheets. This is what controls the design or look and feel of a site.</span></span></span>?</p>
<p>For the first time ever I opened the theme editor. I expected to see the right <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">sidebar<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Sidebar</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">A sidebar in WordPress is referred to a widget-ready area used by WordPress themes to display information that is not a part of the main content.

<p>Styling buttons (the block and elements) is split into “typography” and “colors”.

At the moment one has to go into typography for text and then into color for colors.</p>
<p>Top level color styles: I’m assuming this is styles “elements” and the text above (“different global elements on the site”) confirms that. I can’t define hover/focus styles for buttons – which I would have to do via CSS.</p>
<p>Top level typography styles: The icons for the different entries sometimes communicate current state (eg the background color on the button item), but other settings (eg removing text-decoration underline from link) does not change that. So the list is kind of mixed of current styles and base-styles. The text Aa icon seems to have a different font (the one i defined?) than heading and captions (allthough heading / captions do inherit that font).</p>
<p>When I open the styles for specific blocks and style the button block, the slider for its border radius is set to 0 allthough it has a border-radius (coming from <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">core<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Core</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">Core is the set of software required to run WordPress.

<p>In the storybook the text blocks do not contain any links. So to check the link styles I had to go to Design &gt; Custom Link (the navigation block). It would be great to include a dummy lin in the paragraph block example data.</p>
<p>When saving I get the “Are you ready to save?” screen to check which entities should be saved, even if only one entity (“Global Styles”) needs to be saved. But I guess that makes sense, since accidently publishing styles which are not perfect yet, is bad 😅</p>

I guess this is only usable for first creating your theme, since always exporting and saving to disk is cumbersome. Especially if you use theme.json to set settings for the block editor or custom CSS – it would overwrite those. Allthough that’s something I would need to test in a local dev environment with a custom theme.</p>
<p>Nothing crashed while using it 🙂<br />
That was just a short test of using it on the instawp instance, but it was interesting to see.</p>

<p>I’ll include this in the usability feedback of the recap post. I don’t think we’ll end up having it be a perfect 1:1 reflection but I think it’s worth mentioning.

The editor improves the process and experience of creating new content, making writing rich content much simpler. It uses ‘blocks’ to add richness rather than shortcodes, custom HTML etc. <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/</a></span></span></span> (15.6.1)</p>
<p>With the Create Blocks theme creating a completely blank theme, I had the issue of finding why the <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">header<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Header</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">The header of your site is typically the first thing people will experience.

It may also look different on different screen sizes.</span></span></span> was full width and the footer was not, and specifically finding the block that had the full width assigned.</p>
<p>What I found confusing is that for typography, there’s the preset font sizes (S, M, L, XL) but there’s no interface to change those preset sizes globally from the editor. Same for the defaults of Padding, Margin, Block Spacing and similar items.</p>
<p>When arranging the site title and site tagline next to each other with the Row variation, there’s no setting for the <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">CSS<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">CSS</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">CSS is an acronym for cascading style sheets. This is what controls the design or look and feel of a site.</span></span></span> property <code>align-items</code>, which with the value <code>baseline</code> would allow the smaller site tagline to be nicely aligned with the site title. I can add an extra class for this and it works in the backend, but in the frontend my class is overwritten by the default <code>is-layout-flex</code> class, which has <code>align-items: center</code>. In the backend, the order of the classes is correct, while in the frontend the custom classes load too early and are overwritten by the WP default classes, so I have to use <code>!important</code> here.</p>
<p>For the social icons block, it would be nice to have an exact size adjustment like for fonts, instead of just “Small”, “Normal”, “Large” and “Huge”.</p>
<p>I had adjusted the font size under Styles -&gt; Typography -&gt; Text to be higher than the default one, however it would not apply to all blocks in the content. I had to manually update Post Date, Categories and Tags. For the Post Author and Post Content blocks changing the font size to a custom of 21px did not have any effect on the block. For the post content block, the font size is set at the surrounding <code>div</code>, but does not apply to the paragraph child elements, as there’s a default CSS <code>p { font-size: 16px }</code>, which came from a the font size setting in the Paragraph block, as I found out after some testing. I wonder where the 16px from came from, either from the Create Block Theme or some default setting in WP?</p>
<p>For the Pagination blocks, it would be great if the next <code>Next Post</code> and <code>Previous Post</code> could be changed to something else.</p>
<p>I chose a Google Font at the exact step in the instructions and it worked fine. When I wanted to change the font later on, I can add new fonts to WP through the “Manage Theme Fonts” page, however the newly fonts there don’t show properly (they are added, but the font always falls back to the default system serif font). Also, the list of available fonts does not update in the site editor, I do still have the old font in there, even if I deleted it from the font management page. The font files are added to the assets folder so they are “physically” there, however they’re not loading in WP or the site editor. I’ve checked the <code>Custom Styles</code> entry in the <code>wp_posts</code> table and the old font is there, but none of the new fonts are.</p>
<p>It took me a while to figure out that you need to switch at the top between the Styles and Settings if you’re stuck in one of these sections and want to change the individual block settings instead of the global styles for a particular block.<br />
I do not find it super intuitive to see if I’m editing styles on a global level, for a specific block type or for that one block that is currently selected. The interfaces look all the same, but except for the headline there’s no real difference. I wonder if it could be more highlighted at which level I’m currently changing settings.</p>

<blockquote><p>With the Create Blocks theme creating a completely blank theme, I had the issue of finding why the <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">header<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Header</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">The header of your site is typically the first thing people will experience.

The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience.</span></span></span> that had the full width assigned.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m curious what you think but, rather than opening an issue, this feels related to a different request to have empty templates when starting out: <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/create-block-theme/issues/80" rel="nofollow ugc">https://github.com/WordPress/create-block-theme/issues/80</a> This would allow you to set what you want rather than wrestling with what’s there. Let me know though if you’d prefer an issue is created to make both full width.</p>
<blockquote><p>What I found confusing is that for typography, there’s the preset font sizes (S, M, L, XL) but there’s no interface to change those preset sizes globally from the editor. Same for the defaults of Padding, Margin, Block Spacing and similar items.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noted here: <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/43443#issuecomment-1525687396" rel="nofollow ugc">https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/43443#issuecomment-1525687396</a></p>
<blockquote><p>When arranging the site title and site tagline next to each other with the Row variation, there’s no setting for the <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">CSS<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">CSS</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">CSS is an acronym for cascading style sheets. This is what controls the design or look and feel of a site.</span></span></span> property align-items, which with the value baseline would allow the smaller site tagline to be nicely aligned with the site title. I can add an extra class for this and it works in the backend, but in the frontend my class is overwritten by the default is-layout-flex class, which has align-items: center. In the backend, the order of the classes is correct, while in the frontend the custom classes load too early and are overwritten by the WP default classes, so I have to use !important here.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m going to chat with some of the experts working on Layout here as I’m not sure if it makes the most sense to open a new issue for this, note it as general usability feedback, or comment on a current issue. I’ll <span tabindex="0" class="glossary-item-container">loop<span class="glossary-item-hidden-content"><span class="glossary-item-header">Loop</span> <span class="glossary-item-description">The Loop is PHP code used by WordPress to display posts. Using The Loop, WordPress processes each post to be displayed on the current page, and formats it according to how it matches specified criteria within The Loop tags. Any HTML or PHP code in the Loop will be processed on each post. <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop">https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop</a>.</span></span></span> back here either way and include it in the recap.</p>
<blockquote><p>For the social icons block, it would be nice to have an exact size adjustment like for fonts, instead of just “Small”, “Normal”, “Large” and “Huge”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noted here on a related issue: <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39467#issuecomment-1527740221" rel="nofollow ugc">https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/39467#issuecomment-1527740221</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I had adjusted the font size under Styles -&gt; Typography -&gt; Text to be higher than the default one, however it would not apply to all blocks in the content. I had to manually update Post Date, Categories and Tags. For the Post Author and Post Content blocks changing the font size to a custom of 21px did not have any effect on the block. For the post content block, the font size is set at the surrounding div, but does not apply to the paragraph child elements, as there’s a default CSS p { font-size: 16px }, which came from a the font size setting in the Paragraph block, as I found out after some testing. I wonder where the 16px from came from, either from the Create Block Theme or some default setting in WP?</p></blockquote>
<p>Noted here on a related issue: <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/45086#issuecomment-1527745839" rel="nofollow ugc">https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/45086#issuecomment-1527745839</a> with this issue looking into possible ways of showing the “levels” of styles: <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/49278" rel="nofollow ugc">https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/49278</a></p>
<blockquote><p>For the Pagination blocks, it would be great if the next Next Post and Previous Post could be changed to something else.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>I chose a Google Font at the exact step in the instructions and it worked fine. When I wanted to change the font later on, I can add new fonts to WP through the “Manage Theme Fonts” page, however the newly fonts there don’t show properly (they are added, but the font always falls back to the default system serif font). Also, the list of available fonts does not update in the site editor, I do still have the old font in there, even if I deleted it from the font management page. The font files are added to the assets folder so they are “physically” there, however they’re not loading in WP or the site editor. I’ve checked the Custom Styles entry in the wp_posts table and the old font is there, but none of the new fonts are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Opened an issue here for investigation: <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/create-block-theme/issues/343" rel="nofollow ugc">https://github.com/WordPress/create-block-theme/issues/343</a> Thanks for the detailed report.</p>
