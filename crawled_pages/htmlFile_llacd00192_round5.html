<p>Meet CSUN Success Story Malachia Y. Hoover, who received her <a href="https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/media-releases/csun-biology-team-announces-groundbreaking-cancer-research-method/" target="_blank">undergraduate</a> and <a href="https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/education/csun-students-hard-work-rewarded-with-acceptance-to-doctoral-programs-at-stanford/" target="_blank">g</a>raduate degrees at CSUN, and is currently working towards a <a href="https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/education/csun-students-hard-work-rewarded-with-acceptance-to-doctoral-programs-at-stanford/" target="_blank">doctorate at Stanford University</a>. The former Matador is a Ph.D. candidate at the Chan Laboratory Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine.</p>
<p><strong>What inspired you to apply and attend CSUN? </strong></p>
<p>“I come from the public housing projects in Marin City, Calif., and when I began the application process for colleges, I knew that I could not afford to attend a UC or private institution. I took a college tour to CSUN, and I was amazed how diverse the student population was compared to other universities.”</p>
<p><strong>How did your CSUN experience help shape your life and career?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;My experience at CSUN is what catapulted my pursuit of a graduate degree in biomedical research. It was during my undergraduate years that I gained my first research experience, and I received exceptional mentorship and guidance from my principal investigator, <a href="https://www.calstate.edu/impact-of-the-csu/student-success/Profiles/Pages/Jonathan-Kelber.aspx" target="_blank">Dr. Jonathan Kelber</a>, and programs such as MARC RISE [now known as the <a href="https://www.csun.edu/urise-bridges/u-rise">Undergraduate Student Training in Academic Research (U-RISE) program</a>] and [<a href="https://www.csun.edu/cecs/lsamp">The Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program</a>]. After attaining my BS and master&#8217;s at CSUN, I was highly prepared to perform research at the doctoral level. Currently, I am finishing my last year at Stanford in the stem cell biology and regenerative medicine program. I&#8217;m excited for the next steps in my career and so proud to be a Matador alumnus!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Which CSUN class, program or event had the most impact on your life and how?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>“When I entered CSUN as a freshman, my declared major was mathematics. I knew that I loved the <a href="https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/category/science-and-technology/">STEM fields</a>, but I was still unsure which discipline I liked most. It wasn&#8217;t until I took <a href="https://www.csun.edu/science-mathematics/biology" target="_blank">biology</a>, particularly physiology, that I knew exactly which major I wanted to pursue. Biology amazed and excited me as I learned the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control our body and health. I was fascinated how the cell &#8211; the smallest living unit of life &#8211; was capable of fueling and regulating the processes within our body and other forms of life. The field of biology continues to inspire me as I continue my studies at the graduate level in the field of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. The study and application of biology can reverse disease and stimulate regeneration to improve and save lives. This is what motivates me to pursue a career in biomedical research.”</p>
<p><strong>Which university resources did you utilize the most during your time at CSUN and how did it add to your college experience? </strong></p>
<p>“Pursuing biomedical research in Dr. Jonathan Kelber&#8217;s lab during my undergraduate and master&#8217;s was pivotal in my college experience. Although I declared my <a href="https://www.csun.edu/science-mathematics/biology">major in biology</a>, I was conflicted if I wanted to become a medical doctor and wanted to explore other career choices. I became involved in programs such as LSAMP and MARC RISE [now known as <a href="https://www.csun.edu/urise-bridges/u-rise" target="_blank">U-RISE</a>], which supported minorities and research training and I immediately grew a passion for biomedical research. During my time in Dr. Kelber&#8217;s lab, I began learning techniques and knowledge behind the mechanisms governing cancer and regeneration and became a scientist! It was amazing that I was able to explore new hypotheses in biology that had not been discovered. This curiosity and investigation of the unknown is what fueled my choice to become a research scientist.”</p>
<p><strong>Is there something you learned during your time at CSUN you wish you could tell yourself as a first-year student?</strong></p>
<p>“I would tell myself that you have a long tough journey ahead of you, pursuing such a degree in the STEM field, but you are capable of achieving all your dreams and aspirations! Others, and even at times yourself, will doubt that you can become a Black female scientist, but your passion and determination will take you to places you would have never imagined. Don&#8217;t let the pitfalls and failures define you but let them motivate you to succeed.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 15px; width:240px;">

		</p><p>Have you ever wanted to study away from home and campus? Take classes in Japan, France or Italy? If so, you should get acquainted with the International and Exchange Student Center in the University Student Union.</p>
<p>California State University, Northridge’s International and Exchange Student Center (IESC) in the Division of Student Affairs oversees multiple programs such as California State University International Programs (CSU-IP) and the National Student Exchange. The IESC engages and collaborates with CSUN community partners to achieve their mission, encourage the development of global citizens and enhance CSUN’s reputation at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Study Abroad &amp; National Student Exchange Advisor in the IESC, Rebecca Spector, explained that the office “provides services to newly admitted and continuing international F-1 and J-1 visa students, Fulbright students and participants of the study abroad program and National Student Exchange (NSE).&#8221; Spector added that the office also provides other types of support. &#8220;The IESC also coordinates cultural and social events that allow our students to share their national heritage and get involved with the campus educational community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The IESC also promotes scholarships for students who study abroad. These scholarships include the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship and the Fund for Education Abroad (FEA) scholarship.</p>
<p>From all of the programs they have to offer, the most popular one is the California State University International Program (CSU-IP). It offers students the opportunity to choose from 18 countries to visit and study abroad for either a year or a semester depending on which country is chosen. The 18 countries are Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. This program had over 150 applications submitted for 2022-23.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of studying abroad are discovering different cultures, developing a broader understanding of the world, self-discovery, establishing independence, learning from others, learning a foreign language, enhancing their resume and becoming a global citizen.</p>
<p>However, traveling around the world is not effortless and some students encounter hurdles during their trip. Spector added, “Some adjustments students encounter while traveling abroad are homesickness, language and cultural barriers, and dietary and health issues.” The Study Abroad staff at CSUN, CSU-IP staff in Long Beach at the Chancellor&#8217;s Office and the support staff in the country that the students are studying in help them navigate these adjustments by providing resources and additional guidance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our office holds a mandatory pre-departure meeting where we discuss these topics and provide resources. We are also available to meet with students while they are abroad to help with any adjustments they are facing,&#8221; Spector said. There is also onsite staff that helps students with resources to help combat these issues while abroad,&#8221; Spector continued.</p>

		</p><p>If you were a first-timer at the <a href="https://www.csun.edu/cod/conference/sessions/" target="_blank">CSUN Assistive Technology Conference</a> this year, you certainly weren&#8217;t alone. This year saw a &#8220;significant increase&#8221; in first-time attendees at the nation&#8217;s premier tech conference for people with disabilities, that took place March 13-17 at the Anaheim Marriott.</p>
<p>So what drew all these new people in? Event and Marketing Manager for CSUN&#8217;s Center on Disabilities, Andrew Elkins, said the jump was likely due, in part, to a more robust digital advertising campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that the reputation of the conference and positive word-of-mouth from the community drew new attendees as COVID travel restrictions were reduced,&#8221; Elkins said. &#8220;That, and the need to connect with the community after isolation.&#8221;</p>
<p>That sense of community was on display at what many attendees call the &#8220;CSUN conference.&#8221; People lingered in conference rooms to talk after the educational sessions&#8211; of which more than 300 were offered. Many sat or stood out in the hallways to catch up with others, while red-shirted staff members roamed the large hotel conference center, ready to help anyone who needed assistance finding their way. There was even a new conference feature this year, called &#8220;Birds of a Feather&#8221; — these popular hosted get-togethers took place at lunchtime each day for people with similar interests&#8211; one was devoted to first-time attendees.</p>
<p>Another big draw at the conference was the exhibit hall, which was free to the public. Two enormous rooms housed more than 100 exhibitors, ranging from technology giants like IBM and Sony to small companies showcasing their accessibility-minded products. There were numerous types of technology and services on display, including a variety of screen readers, apps and cameras.</p>
<p>More than 3,500 people attended this year&#8217;s annual conference and technology expo, which got its start in 1985 on the CSUN campus. It&#8217;s one of a handful of conferences in the world dedicated to showcasing new technology to create more inclusive experiences for people with disabilities. <a href="https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/" target="_blank">CSUN Today </a>talked with some of the people who attended to find out their favorite aspects of the event.</p>
<p>Mika Pyyhkala is the director of digital accessibility for Envision, a Kansas-based company that offers products and services to blind and visually impaired people. He has been coming to the conference for many years, following it through many changes of venue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back when it was at LAX, and when it was at San Diego and when it came here,&#8221; Pyyhkala said.</p>
<p>For him, the major reasons for attending are to check out the latest technology and to network. &#8220;The blind community is small and you know there are some people that you might just see at one or two events throughout the year, from different parts of the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pyyhkala&#8217;s colleague, Therese Goren, came to the conference for the first time last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have heard about the famous CSUN Conference for years and have always wanted to come,&#8221; Goren said.</p>
<p>Goren teaches and trains people on how to use screen readers, magnification devices and other assistive technology as a senior analyst at Envision. The &#8220;latest and greatest&#8221; tech on display piqued her interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything to do with digital accessibility,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Then meeting and networking and getting to know all these amazing people that are out here doing the same thing that I want to do and try and improve everybody&#8217;s lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keith Clark was overseeing the T-Mobile booth in one of the conference&#8217;s exhibit halls, explaining the products and services available for the hard of hearing, deaf, blind and people with speech disabilities. Through his interpreter, Jay Slater Scancella, Clark said this was his second time working at the conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already met so many folks that I remember from last year, people [saying] &#8216;Oh, I remember you&#8217; and it&#8217;s just great to reconnect,&#8221; Clark said. &#8220;Between last year and this year, so many things have happened. So many new technologies have emerged. It&#8217;s a very, very quickly growing field.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next year&#8217;s conference will take place March 18-22, 2024 at the Anaheim Marriott.</p>

<hr />
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Román Zaragoza got nervous when he read the character description before his audition for the sitcom “Ghosts.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As an actor of Akimel O&#8217;otham and Mexican descent on his father&#8217;s side and Japanese and Taiwanese descent on his mother&#8217;s side, Zaragoza ’21 (Cinema and Television Arts – Film) doubted his prospects in television or film because of all the stereotypical Native American and Asian roles he found himself auditioning for — and there were so many ways<strong> </strong>the writing for this Native character could’ve gone wrong, too.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I was like, ‘Oh no, it&#8217;s a show called ‘Ghosts,’ and it&#8217;s a character that&#8217;s <a href="https://nlltribe.com/about-us-before-import/" target="_blank">Lenape</a> and he&#8217;s from the 1500s,’” he recalled. “‘Oh, no, they&#8217;re gonna want me to have an accent and do some stereotypical thing.’ But then right below, it said, ‘Please use your normal accent.’”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">That changed everything.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The more Zaragoza learned about the multi-dimensional character, Sasappis, and the show, the more excited he became.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He auditioned for the role and shot the pilot in late 2020, while in his last year at California State University, Northridge. The show was picked up in early 2021, and when he graduated, Zaragoza found himself starring on what has become one of the most popular sitcoms on TV, a hit with audiences and critics alike. “Ghosts,” which airs on CBS and can be streamed on Paramount+, was recently picked up for a third season.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For Zaragoza, who loved sitcoms such as &#8220;How I Met Your Mother,&#8221; &#8220;Friends&#8221; and &#8220;Parks and Recreation,&#8221; landing a starring role on a hit network comedy is a dream come true.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing, and then to be playing a character like Sass, it&#8217;s been a really beautiful experience,&#8221; Zaragoza said. &#8220;And seeing how the Native community has really supported him and the story, it&#8217;s really cool. I&#8217;m very, very grateful and constantly just pinching myself.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">CSUN’s film program in the Mike Curb College of Arts, Media, and Communication intentionally makes space for voices that historically haven&#8217;t been fairly represented on TV and in films. The program is designed to give students experiences in a lot of industry roles, said Jared Rappaport, chair of CSUN’s Department of Cinema and Television Arts (CTVA).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We pride ourselves on developing new talents, with new voices going out in the industry,” Rappaport said. “We look at ourselves as the CTVA family. So, when our students succeed in Hollywood — we have a lot of success stories — we&#8217;re very proud of what they&#8217;ve accomplished.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Zaragoza is already using his voice to help ensure respectful representation in his projects, and he plans to continue telling stories in a variety of ways as his career unfolds. He has starred on stage and screen and successfully ventured into directing and producing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“CSUN definitely gave me the tools and the space to tell my own stories,” he said.</p>

<div id="attachment_52478" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-52478 size-full" src="https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/wp-content/uploads/118879_0045bc.jpg" alt="Roman Zaragoza as Sasappis.

<hr />
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Ghosts” stars Rose McIver and Utkarsh Ambudkar as a young couple who inherit a haunted estate that they turn into a bed-and-breakfast. Many of the people who died on the property are stuck there as a sort of purgatory — among others, Sasappis haunts the property alongside the ghosts of a Viking, a Prohibition-era singer, a hippie who tried to hug a bear, and a &#8220;finance bro&#8221; who died without pants on (and now spends eternity without them).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sasappis — shortened to “Sass,” and that’s Zaragoza’s preferred spelling of the nickname — has a dry wit and a love for pizza. He’s a talented storyteller, a hopeless romantic and a bit of a troublemaker. After being stuck on the property for hundreds of years, he creates drama out of boredom, such as when he discovered one character’s secret crush on another and told everyone almost instantly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While there’s much more progress to be made, Sass arrived at a moment when Native representation has increased in front of and behind the camera — Zaragoza cited the TV shows “Reservation Dogs” and “Rutherford Falls,” as well as the “Predator” movie prequel “Prey.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The “Ghosts” showrunners invited Zaragoza’s input on the best ways to craft respectful representation on their show. At his suggestion, they hired a Lenape consultant, Joe Baker. A writer on staff, John Timothy, is Muskogee Creek.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In a season two episode, Sass wants to save an old tree on the property that has personal significance to him. The episode ends with a land acknowledgement, including a discussion about why they’re important.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The show works because it’s not only funny, but it also makes you feel things,&#8221; Zaragoza said. &#8220;It’s so healing. There are so many messages and storylines where we dive into death and love and family and loss. I just love the messages.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The land acknowledgement episode was particularly meaningful to Zaragoza, who was active in CSUN’s American Indian Student Association, took American Indian Studies classes, and attended the campus&#8217; annual Powwow to celebrate American Indian communities of Los Angeles and greater Southern California. In 2020, following conversations between the Fernandeño Tataviam Band of Mission Indians and CSUN faculty and administrators, CSUN began publicly acknowledging the Sesevitam, the first people of this ancestral and unceded territory of Sesevenga, which is now occupied by the university, and the Sesevitam descendants who are citizens of the Tataviam Band. Students advocated for additional recognition efforts on campus.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After graduation, Zaragoza also hosted a video podcast for the American Indian Student Association, interviewing Indigenous artists such as writer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1lGJ2MUA4" target="_blank">Stephen Graham Jones</a>, “Spirit Rangers” creator and showrunner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m2naiB563k" target="_blank">Karissa Valencia</a>, and his sister, recording artist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYWFqKmVW94" target="_blank">Raye Zaragoza</a>. (Román&#8217;s directing credits include some of her music videos.)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m always excited to see the relationship between universities and Indigenous nations,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #bf0d0d;"><b>&#8216;Your Voice Matters&#8217;</b></span></h4>
<div id="attachment_52473" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-52473" src="https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/wp-content/uploads/HEIGHTS-2785.jpg" alt="Román Zaragoza in a CSUN Department of Theatre production" width="960" height="640" srcset="https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/wp-content/uploads/HEIGHTS-2785-300x200.jpg 300w, https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/wp-content/uploads/HEIGHTS-2785-768x512.jpg 768w, https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/wp-content/uploads/HEIGHTS-2785.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Román Zaragoza as Usnavi in a CSUN Department of Theatre production of &#8220;In the Heights.&#8221; Photo by Anneka Bunnag.</p></div>
<hr />
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Zaragoza grew up in New York City, the son of actor Gregory Zaragoza and business professor Shirley Zaragoza. He moved to Los Angeles with his family at age 11 when his older sister, Danielle, got into UCLA. He thought he would follow in her footsteps, but he didn’t get into UCLA. CSUN accepted him, and it turned out to be a terrific fit — the CTVA program is highly regarded as one of the best in the country.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He arrived at CSUN in 2014 and took a screenwriting class his freshman year, and he set his mind to learning to direct as well. In spring 2017, he played the lead role of Usnavi in the Department of Theatre’s production of “In the Heights” at The Soraya.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“My freshman year I just really learned, ‘Your voice matters,’” he said. “I’m very grateful for the experiences I had there. It was definitely one of those parts of my life where I felt very lost, and then CSUN really helped me find what I wanted and where I wanted to go.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Zaragoza also had honed his acting chops in high school. At 15, he joined Native Voices at the Autry, an equity theatre company at the Autry Museum of the American West that develops and produces works by Native artists. Zaragoza’s role in the Native Voices show “Off the Rails” led him to eventually taking a three-year break from CSUN, as the show was selected for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #bf0d0d;"><b>Return to CSUN</b></span></h4>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He returned to CSUN in August 2020, joining an unfamiliar cohort of classmates on Zoom.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He was one of three producers on the senior film project “This Is Their Land,” written and directed by classmate Michael O’Leary ’21 (Cinema and Television Arts – Film). The film is about the Modoc leader known as Captain Jack, and his tense peace negotiations with the U.S. Army in his ancestral homeland in Northern California and Southern Oregon, during the Modoc War of 1872-73.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Zaragoza filled a wide range of roles on the project, including helping to ensure a respectful telling of the story. He helped with casting, making connections with the descendants of the Modoc people depicted in the film, and finding a translator who could translate much of the script into the traditional Mukluk language.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Zaragoza also has a small role in the film. His father, who has starred on Broadway and appeared in many movies and TV shows — including “Yellowstone” and an episode of “Ghosts” in which he plays Sass’s father — also appears in the short film.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This Is Their Land&#8221; has been screened at festivals and also will get its pandemic-delayed CSUN celebration, at the <a href="https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/arts-and-culture/csun-showcase-throws-spotlight-on-hollywoods-future-filmmakers/">CTVA 31st Senior Film Showcase</a> (2021 Redux) on May 3.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Zaragoza said he hopes to one day start a production company with friends he made at CSUN.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There’s just really talented people that came out of that program,&#8221; Zaragoza said. &#8220;I’m very grateful for the program and all the friends I made from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ortega is the elected leader of the Fernandeño Tataviam Band of Mission Indians (FTBMI) and his ancestors come from the villages that originated in the geographical areas of Santa Clarita, Simi and San Fernando Valleys. His dedication to tribal affairs began as a child while shadowing his father, the late Tribal Chairman Rudy Ortega, Sr. He was first elected Vice President for the FTBMI at the age of 18.</p>
<p>Through this role, Ortega continued efforts of the tribe’s mission to protect the rights of Fernandeño Tataviam as Native Americans. He assisted in the reinvigoration of the tribe’s non-profit, Pukúu Cultural Community Services, to provide community programs to Native Americans living in Los Angeles County, as well as to sustain the Fernandeño Tataviam community. Through Pukúu, Ortega also oversees the Haramokngna American Indian Cultural Center.</p>
<p>As Tribal President, Ortega works with local and state governments and the California Historical Commission on policies to protect and enhance tribal resources and ancestral territory. He was instrumental in negotiating the repatriation of tribal remains in Angeles National Forest and in securing traditional land in LA County for future tribal burials.</p>
<p>He was appointed to CSUN’s Commission on Diversity in 2022 and is integral to the cultural fabric of the university, raising awareness for Native students and Native communities and providing blessings at important university events. Ortega&#8217;s leadership is also helping to create partnerships with CSUN’s academic community focused on climate resiliency, internships, non-profit incubators and teacher training,</p>

<p>Yu is an acclaimed television screenwriter and award-winning author of four books, including &#8220;Interior Chinatown,&#8221; which explores the stereotypes of Asian Americans in Hollywood and in American culture more broadly. “Interior Chinatown” won the 2020 National Book Award for fiction, was shortlisted for the Le Prix Médicis étranger and longlisted for the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction.</p>
<p>He received the National Book Foundation’s 5 Under 35 Award and was nominated for two Writers Guild of America Awards for his work on the HBO series, Westworld. He has also written for shows on FX, AMC, Facebook Watch, and Adult Swim. His fiction and non-fiction have appeared in a number of publications including The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, The Atlantic, Wired, Time and Harper’s.</p>
<p>Yu is a graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, where he majored in molecular and cellular biology and minored in creative writing. He obtained his law degree from Columbia Law School. Yu worked as an associate at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell and Bryan Cave as a corporate attorney, as the director of business affairs at Digital Domain, and as an associate general counsel at Belkin International before becoming a full-time fiction and TV writer.</p>
<p>Together with TaiwaneseAmerican.org, he established the Betty L. Yu and Jin C. Tu Writing prizes in honor of his parents.</p>
<div class="mceTemp">Born and raised in Lihue, Hawaii, Valera earned his journalism degree from CSUN in 1968 before forming his own public relations and marketing agency. He would later work exclusively for the National Notary Association and become the association&#8217;s CEO and president in 1982. Valera revolutionized the profession by introducing comprehensive educational initiatives, creating special publications and authoring rules of ethical and professional conduct that serve as the foundation for notary best practices in the U.S. today.</div>

<p>As an alumnus and volunteer leader at CSUN, Valera serves on boards of the CSUN Foundation, The Soraya, and the Mike Curb College of Arts, Media, and Communication and served on the Campaign Leadership Committee for the university. He was honored with volunteer service awards from the Alumni Association Journalism Chapter in 2003 and University Advancement in 2005. In 2011, he received the Dorothea “Granny” Heitz Award for Outstanding Volunteer Leadership, and in 2019, he was recognized with the university’s Distinguished Alumni Award.</p>
<p>Valera and his wife, Debbie, are also longtime supporters of CSUN. Together they have committed more than $11 million for programs across the campus, particularly those that support students who have been part of the foster care system. In 2020, in recognition of the Valeras’ transformative gift, CSUN’s administration building was renamed Valera Hall.</p>
<p>The Valeras’ are also active supporters of K-12 education, and in 2019, the Sun Valley Valera Middle Academy was named in honor of their investment to support the educational success of public-school students in under-resourced communities.</p>

		</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a simple idea: Education and opportunity can change the world. The new Autodesk Technology Engagement Center at California State University, Northridge will be a place where students learn, create and innovate by making things.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Making is a front door to inspiring young people to do more with technology and pursue a technical education,” said Andrew Anagnost ’87 (Engineering), president and CEO of Autodesk Inc., the software company whose support is honored through the facility’s name. “Because when they make something, their curiosity and interest are ignited. That’s what the Autodesk Technology Engagement Center is all about: igniting the curiosity and interest of the next generation of innovators.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">CSUN broke ceremonial ground on the Autodesk Technology Engagement Center on April 14, officially launching a center of innovation and exploration for students from preschool through college. The facility will accommodate academic programs in the university’s College of Engineering and Computer Science, equity-focused STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) programming, and Global Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) Equity Innovation Hub programming.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Designed by architecture firm AC Martin, the facility will include state-of-the-art research, design and digital capture, and fabrication labs, as well as a maker space for the campus and wider community. There will be space for peer-led student support services, and the center will enable students’ progression to graduation and help them transition to careers in STEAM and in the creative and tech economies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The center, scheduled to open in fall 2024, will be located next to Jacaranda Hall.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Examples of the student creativity that Autodesk and state, federal and university officials are trying to nurture were on display at the groundbreaking, including a Formula SAE single-seat, open wheeled race car; an autonomous airplane designed to fight wildfires; and a concrete canoe.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The event was a chance to celebrate the project and those who have championed it. <a href="http://autodesk.com/" target="_blank">Autodesk Inc.</a>, a leader in design and make software, has provided over $7 million in total support. The company was one of the first to invest in what was originally called the “Center of Possibilities” by university officials.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“By leveraging their vast resources, expertise and belief in the power of technology as a force for positive social change, Autodesk is addressing some of the world’s most pressing challenges,” said CSUN President Erika D. Beck. “CSUN is incredibly fortunate for Autodesk’s partnership and their investment in the future of our academic community, providing access to STEAM educational opportunities and inspiring the next generation of creators, innovators and change-makers.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With Autodesk’s support, a feasibility study set the course for the facility. A $25 million state allocation from California Gov. Gavin Newsom was made possible with support from U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, Congressman Tony Cárdenas and Assemblywoman Luz Rivas — who all delivered heartfelt and inspiring remarks at the groundbreaking event. Padilla also helped secure $1 million in federal funding.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The expanded public-private partnership resulted in the realization of a hub that will bring the community, and preschool through college partners, together to facilitate new educational pathways.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With significant support from Apple Inc. as part of its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, CSUN is the host campus for the new Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub program, launching initiatives in the region, statewide through the California State University system, and nationally.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The Autodesk Technology Engagement Center is a physical manifestation of the mission of the CSU,” said Jolene Koester, interim chancellor of California State University and president emerita of CSUN. “It’s going to advance knowledge, it’s going to provide authentic access to excellent education and educational opportunities, and, ultimately, it contributes to preparing a diverse workforce for the tech and creative industries to fuel the economies of the state of California and spill over to the nation.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The facility will be — in the words of Associated Students President Shayan Moshtael that were echoed by speakers throughout the ceremony — &#8220;epic.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Climate change, alternative energy, cybersecurity and many more issues can be addressed through innovation, Padilla said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I have no doubt this Autodesk Technology Engagement Center, and hub overall, will produce the future scientists, the future innovators, and the future leaders who will create a better world for all of us,” Padilla said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Anagnost spoke of the gaps in opportunity and mentorship that can lead to careers in innovation. He talked emotionally about personal struggles in high school that nearly kept him out of college, and how CSUN gave him the opportunity to realize his full potential. Investing in institutions like CSUN can help close these gaps, he said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s why centers like this are so important,” Anagnost said. “They create access. They build bridges. They create opportunity.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">They help create the future and change the world, indeed.</p>

<hr />
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The stories are as diverse as their filmmakers: An ex-gang member struggling to help his mother return home. A son fulfilling his father’s baseball dream. A father struggling to provide for his son. Two lonely people battling solitary confinement. An effort to negotiate peace in the middle of a war.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The public is invited to explore these cinematic stories and preview the talents of the next generation of filmmakers on. Wednesday, May 3, at California State University, Northridge’s 31<sup>st</sup> Senior Film Showcase (2021 redux) at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The showcase, which concludes years of study for the university’s senior-level film students, is scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. in the academy’s Samuel Goldwyn Theater, located at 8949 Wilshire Blvd. in Beverly Hills.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The work by the students makes us proud and underscores their professional and creative talents,” Thomas said. “Our students come from mostly working-class backgrounds and have diverse stories to tell. As their films demonstrate, they have the skills to tell those stories effectively. As members of the entertainment industry, they will add new voices and perspectives to those who already entertain and sometimes provoke us with their filmmaking.”</p>

		</p><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-52273" src="https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/wp-content/uploads/Ukraine-flierv2-2023-1-232x300.jpg" alt="Ukraine-flierv2-2023 (1)" width="300" height="388" srcset="https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/wp-content/uploads/Ukraine-flierv2-2023-1-232x300.jpg 232w, https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/wp-content/uploads/Ukraine-flierv2-2023-1-768x994.jpg 768w, https://csunshinetoday.csun.edu/wp-content/uploads/Ukraine-flierv2-2023-1-791x1024.jpg 791w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />As the deadly conflict between Russia and Ukraine carries over into another year, the images of overrun cities and stories of lives lost continue making headlines.</p>
<p>To better understand the war, a discussion on the ongoing struggle and its significance to the survival of Ukrainian culture will take place at California State University, Northridge on Tuesday, April 25, from 6-8 p.m. in the Ferman Presentation Room of the University Library, located in the center of the campus at 18111 Nordhoff Street.</p>
<p>The discussion, “<a href="https://library.csun.edu/events/spotlight-ukraine?type=event" target="_blank">Spotlight on Ukraine-History, Politics, and the Path Forward</a>&#8220;, will include a live presentation and consist of first-person accounts by a Ukrainian family who recently left their war-torn nation and immigrated to California. This event is sponsored by the Friends of the University Library and free and open to the public.</p>
<p>A summary of the history of Russian-Ukrainian political and cultural conflicts over the last several decades leading to the present conflict will be given by CSUN history professor Donal O’Sullivan, who regularly teaches classes in Russian and German history.</p>
<p>O’Sullivan won the CSUN Distinguished Teaching Award in 2009 and the College Teaching Fellowship in 2012. His dissertation was on Soviet policy in Eastern Europe and the Western response, while his next book was “Dealing with the Devil: Anglo-Soviet Intelligence Co-Operation During the Second World War.”</p>
<p>Ukrainian couple Dmytro and Nataliia Chyrkin will also discuss their departure from their home city of Odessa, their perilous journey undertaken separately with their two children and reuniting in Germany before coming to America.</p>
<p>“The war in Ukraine is one of the most crucial geo-political events in the world today,” said Mark Stover, Dean of the University Library. “I’m looking forward to hearing from our panel of experts who will discuss the ongoing crisis. I anticipate that the panelists will share important insights and perspectives, providing a valuable forum for discussion and debate on this pressing issue.”</p>
<p>A Q&amp;A will follow the panel discussion and will be moderated by Robert Gohstand, geography professor emeritus.</p>
<p>This public event will be held in the university library’s Ferman Presentation Room on April 25 from 6–8 p.m. The library is located in the center of the campus at 18111 Nordhoff Street.</p>
