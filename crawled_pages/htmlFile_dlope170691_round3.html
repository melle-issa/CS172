<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><a href="https://twitter.com/kimberlylipari?lang=en">Kim Lipari</a>, owner and CEO of <a href="https://twitter.com/thewpvalet">Valet</a>, talks with <a href="https://twitter.com/corymiller303">Cory Miller</a> about their insights and experiences on entrepreneurship, including how to handle challenges, the importance of building relationships, and the role of vulnerability in leadership. They offer advice on building a successful WordPress business and emphasize the need for continuous learning and personal growth. Overall, this episode provides valuable insights and advice for anyone interested in entrepreneurship and building a successful WordPress-based business.</p>



<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>



<ul type="video" class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
<li><strong>Outsourcing Infrastructure. </strong>WordPress hosting companies can benefit from outsourcing their infrastructure to specialized providers such as WP Cloud. This can free up their customer support team from dealing with infrastructure-related issues and enable them to focus on providing better customer service and value-added services.</li>



<li><strong>Increase Customer Satisfaction.</strong> By democratizing publishing and providing a superior WordPress experience, hosting companies can reduce churn and retain customers who may otherwise switch to other platforms if their WordPress experience is subpar.</li>



<li><strong>Set Up for Speed.</strong> While many factors can impact website speed, some of the most important ones include optimizing images, using a content delivery network (CDN), and minimizing the use of plugins. By focusing on these areas, WordPress agencies can help their clients improve their website speed and ultimately provide a better user experience for their visitors.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper" id="h-transcript">Transcript</h2>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> [00:00:00] hey everybody. Welcome back to Post Status Draft. This is part of our agency series, and I&#8217;m talking to a longtime friend and an awesome agency owner in the space, Kimberly Lepar of Valet Fame.  </p>



<p>We&#8217;re gonna be talking about, um, The role in the changing value of websites to organizations. Um, Vale&#8217;s been around so long and has so much experience and just diving into that with Kimberly is gonna be really, really exciting for me because updating her knowledge for how websites and their role, uh, in the world and businesses and organizations, she&#8217;s got a front seat view to that with her team, what they do for their clients.  </p>



<p>And we&#8217;re gonna talk about, um, some of those elements that, um, an organization should. Outsource stick to their core competency and outsource. But before we get all of that, we&#8217;re gonna have a fun conversation talking about where websites sit today in the market, on the internet, their value and role, and no better person to talk about that than Kimberly.  </p>



<p>So Kimberly, would you mind sharing a little bit about [00:01:00] yourself and what you do at ballet?&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. First of all, thanks for having me. It&#8217;s always a pleasure. I . Love hanging out and having conversations like this. I think they&#8217;re so important. Um, and I am the owner of valet.io. We offer comprehensive end-to-end website management services for businesses that wanna have a strong brand presence, um, want to make sure they&#8217;re communicating themselves well online and need a team to support them so that they can focus on the things that they do best every day.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Gosh, you&#8217;re awesome. I, I&#8217;m gonna come back to the end to end because I think that&#8217;s one of the compelling parts of this conversation too. All that you do health. And then having a, a firm, an agency, a partner really that can do so much for the website. Um, but Okay, let&#8217;s dive in. So we&#8217;ve been talking about this for a couple of months now, but I saw you posted on LinkedIn and I&#8217;ll put those in the show notes.  </p>



<p>That post, I think it was so timely and so [00:02:00] good. I&#8217;ve been kind of updating my view about all this. Mm-hmm. And you know, in the old days, Websites for these, like, and I find myself still referring to him like they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re a brochure at the base. Mm-hmm. A 24 7, 365 days, a, a year where your clients can go in and kind of check out what you do, but your post really illuminated something that&#8217;s all evolved and changed as the world has changed and business.  </p>



<p>And, um, what are you seeing there? Um, with the changing value and importance and focus on websites for business and organizations that you serve.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Well, I think namely the, the chief change is that Gone is the, uh, my business at webmaster email address, uh, that used to be, uh, the sole, uh, provider and contact point for what websites were for a lot of companies.  </p>



<p>Uh, they were kind of these closed off boxes where only, you know, two people could edit the HTML and, [00:03:00] and change things up. So, um, from that, And you say the olden days, which it feels like that, but I think maybe even just in the past, I don&#8217;t know, probably five, five years or so, it, it&#8217;s escalated very quickly to become, uh, that the website is important to the CEO, uh, for one reason or another, probably more for.  </p>



<p>Um, brand identity so that, you know, how are we putting our best space forward, right? These, uh, very broad, uh, strokes of what the business means. Uh, it&#8217;s important to marketing, uh, to make sure that they are communicating the services effectively, that there&#8217;s good copy, good, uh, interaction, uh, social integrations, right?  </p>



<p>It&#8217;s also important to, uh, sales managers and even, um, other line level employees. Um, and other parts of the business to be able to share what they&#8217;re doing or provide. PDFs, white papers, all kinds of registrations. I mean, all those [00:04:00] different things. So it&#8217;s become a very, uh, Uh, crowdsourced, um, important piece of, of a business.  </p>



<p>And so that&#8217;s changed a lot. It&#8217;s no longer one person kind of holding the keys that can understand. It&#8217;s now really commonplace for everybody in a business to, to think of the website in a different way with a different sort of use for the role that they play.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> One of the things that strikes me from what you&#8217;re saying in our discussions in the past, particularly with your, your clients and what you see is this, when you said webmaster, it&#8217;s this thought of a supplemental thing, like an a, almost an afterthought that websites were once mm-hmm.  </p>



<p>Thought of now to be in very integral to everything the business and organization does. Um, I remember talking with some of your, About some of your clients that you all work with and, and you, you had an interesting way to say it. You&#8217;re like, maybe they weren&#8217;t straight on e-commerce, so at Ithe or post status for [00:05:00] instance.  </p>



<p>Um, you know, that was, that was it like, yeah. If, if the website&#8217;s down we&#8217;re not making money, you know? Mm-hmm. But you&#8217;re seeing a multifaceted, uh, approach now where it&#8217;s not just an afterthought and supplemental, it&#8217;s really key to driving the mission and goals of the organization. And I thought that was really interesting and awesome for WordPress, by the way.  </p>



<p>Mm-hmm. And the internet that. Seeing that value change, I wonder if some of that got spur on with pandemic. You know, I&#8217;ve heard a lot of, let&#8217;s say a yo yoga studio or those in-person physical location, bricks and mortar businesses go, yeah, what do we do now? Well, I loved if there&#8217;s positives that came outta covid.  </p>



<p>It was the fact that it pushed people to go. That&#8217;s not our only means of business. But can you talk a little bit and share what you see from client perspective about the role of websites in these organizations?&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Absolutely. Absolutely. I think I have two, um, two very specific examples. I think, uh, [00:06:00] from very different sides of the coin, um, that kind of point out some of the changes that we&#8217;re seeing.  </p>



<p>Um, working on a project with a client who, uh, is trying to consolidate, um, a few different brands, uh, under an umbrella into one, um, during the meetings throughout this project. We can hear the different. Stakeholders in the project, throughout the company, um, really communicating what&#8217;s important to them.  </p>



<p>And this kind of goes back to what each person in the web, in the business thinks the website should do. Right. Um, you know, the CEO is is much more concerned about. The, the layout, how things are presented. Uh, you have marketing and other, um, sub-departments of, of that worried about, well, it&#8217;s, is it flashy enough?  </p>



<p>You know, where&#8217;s the, where&#8217;s the pizazz? And then you have, um, someone else who. Has submitted copy and then it gets pulled a week later because no one [00:07:00] within the confines of the project had really taken the time to dig deep into what those words were. So that actually became kind of an afterthought, but then it bumped up in priority.  </p>



<p>So you have all of these different things that should matter. But there&#8217;s no, uh, kind of cohesive brain on, uh mm-hmm. When and where they matter, right. Uh, because this kind of traditional business roles, right? So I think even, even business itself is kind of catching up to how it feels about what its website is and what it does.  </p>



<p>Um, alternatively, um, outside of the web presence, businesses that traditionally take place, With more, uh, one-on-one, um, interactions. I have, um, a, a dear friend who I spoke with a couple weeks ago who works in oil field sales and they typically do their, their sales and marketing person to person, right?  </p>



<p>It&#8217;s, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s go on a fishing charter, let&#8217;s go have lunch and all these things. And I. They are, they&#8217;re not leveraging their website well enough to actually say, Hey, we now do these four [00:08:00] other things, uh, that we haven&#8217;t, you know, we only tell people in, in person to person meetings, uh, and the CEO says, you know, oh, well, yeah, we have one.  </p>



<p>And that&#8217;s fine enough. But is is person to person, um, enough nowadays, are they gonna go to lunch with you and then go check out your website? Right? Do you offer a brochure of services, um, within that and explain what it is that you do? So, um, I think it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s such a widely used normal tool now to just go to someone&#8217;s url, um, that from, from online focused.  </p>



<p>Primary businesses and person to person, um, based, you know, formally traditional, right? Brick and mortar or service, service style companies, even in large industries, you know, million dollar year industries like oilfield. Um, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s changing. It has to. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, yeah. I think I lost the thread there a little, but&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> No.  </p>



<p>And why not? Why not [00:09:00] utilize this amazing technology, for instance? So, you know, you can use WordPress to build a website, but then the advent of Google and the search engines that push traffic, people are looking for destinations to find problem, you know, answers to their. Challenges. And so the advent of marketing and understanding with SEO and paid traffic and things like that, back to a site where you could convert it, measure it.  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Yeah. Even, yeah, even on the back end. And that was one of the things that I talked about, uh, with my friend. They don&#8217;t have a A A CRM of, of much of any kind. It just kind of lives in these guys&#8217; heads that go out to these travel routes. You know, we always live on this hit by a bus scenario mm-hmm. Of what happens if I get hit by a bus tomorrow?  </p>



<p>What is my team, you know, gonna do what have, what have I laid for information and documentation and. You know, formally, uh, businesses that have been person to person are, are missing an opportunity to kind of move into that digital age of, of finding [00:10:00] clients and putting them on a journey or, um, even, even if it&#8217;s just a, a consideration of the journey you wanna put people on outside of the web experience.  </p>



<p>Right? It&#8217;s all, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a good. Um, what am I thinking of? Mind mapping? Mm-hmm. Um, I guess of, of how you want all that to work. So from, from the backend, from the actual interfacing with the customer to the front end to how the customer sees you. There&#8217;s a lot of that in between, but it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s now all being laid on the, on the website.  </p>



<p>This is the website&#8217;s job and that&#8217;s, there&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a lot. There&#8217;s a lot going on.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, you mentioned two, two kind of groups. It&#8217;s either marketing managers that I assume could have different title, but somebody that manages the marketing, seeing the value of websites for marketing their business. Uh, and then you also mentioned CEOs.  </p>



<p>So that to me just instantly says, Importance, like recognizing the importance that a website can do all these functions. Add [00:11:00] to not just supplement, supplement, but be very complimentary and strengthen cells. You know, if you&#8217;re in B2B cells, I have a friend, I think we, you and I have talked about as a manufacturing company, sells all over the world.  </p>



<p>Well, the search results for those are probably very small, but they&#8217;re long tail and very easily capturable. You know, like, yep. Um, they&#8217;re, somebody&#8217;s going online to find that part or that. Particular, you spell those compressors, but you know, and then so like you could grow your bottom line or your top line really easily, just with some simple things with a WordPress website.  </p>



<p>Absolutely. And then like you said, for those b2b, it&#8217;s, there&#8217;s so many things. Support is another bucket of things. I think of a website is like, I can&#8217;t remember who I&#8217;m supposed to call for this. Or I need to ask a question, go to the website right there. Mm-hmm.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Absolutely.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So I think that&#8217;s good. Very good.  </p>



<p>In terms of the industry, in terms of the [00:12:00] internet, of course, we love the open web post status and you did too of la um, through WordPress. So that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s good seeing that value, knowing it has such utility for the overall growth and seeing the mm-hmm. Importance of that. And then, um, but this is interesting.  </p>



<p>So are you seeing, uh, from the role perspective, they&#8217;ve now seen it. Now you have a different people coming in with different. Needs and wants for their website. And is there someone unifying that from the client perspective or is it a lot of different stakeholders coming, going, well, we need this. Okay.  </p>



<p>Is there somebody synthesizing all of that?&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> We play that role where we can, uh, where, where we have been allowed to. I think we st oftentimes we&#8217;ll get very lucky and we&#8217;ll have a C-level, um, stakeholder involved that can do, uh, the, I think of as like a Venn diagram where you have linear thinkers and strategic [00:13:00] thinkers.  </p>



<p>And that overlapping section is someone who can live in both worlds or at least empathize very well, uh, with one or the other. So, Um, we play that role as often as we can, uh, and we try to move people into a space where they realize that is possible. Uh, two things can be true. Uh, you can want to have a very grand strategic, um, uh, presence, you know, with, with wonderful colors and layout and good copy, but at the same time, There&#8217;s some technical decisions that need to be made.  </p>



<p>Um, you know, and some research that needs to be done kind of in between. So overlapping, uh, you&#8217;ll see, um, there are specific roles. Marketing managers I find are kind of expanding into that. Um, and they&#8217;re sourcing companies like us to handle the technical depth, um, and to help us translate that, that gray area, um, where you have strategy.  </p>



<p>Kind of overlapping with this linear direction of where people wanna go. [00:14:00]&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So oftentimes it&#8217;s the CEO marketing manager type that is your point person. But then are there other teams or are they funneling through that person, or are they coming straight to valet, for instance, on those?&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Oh, they&#8217;ll come straight to us.  </p>



<p>They&#8217;ll come straight to us. We work with a lot of different people within, uh, within the. The org chart. Um, but really the kind of, you have to be in a position. Where you are looking at the forest and the trees. Mm-hmm. Um, to be able to kind of drive direction or, um, get the most value out of the advice in the consultation, you know, that, that an agency like our can offer.  </p>



<p>Because we can&#8217;t come across too, um, too bossy, right? You&#8217;re using the wrong thing. Why would you tell me that? I researched and it&#8217;s fine. No, I&#8217;m not saying it because you&#8217;re wrong. I&#8217;m saying because, you know, we, we have experience. We can give you a better option. So, um, you know, it&#8217;s, and we can see the [00:15:00] forest, you know, we know what else is going on.  </p>



<p>I know you really wanna use this one tool, but you have this other one over here that you&#8217;re not aware of that someone else installed. Um, you know, and those won&#8217;t work together. So, you know, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s. We work really well with roles that kind of have essentially the same purview in their job that we have in ours as tech advisors.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. Uh, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s so interesting cuz you mentioned kind of in the, first of all this, the role of the webmaster. That&#8217;s, and you know, in the early days it was maybe find somebody that can cobble this stuff together. Uh, but that changing role where they see the importance and then go, but they still need someone with expertise that can advise them, should I, I can go left or right, which way should I go?  </p>



<p>Yeah. And it seems like which the role you&#8217;re, you all are providing too is offer, there&#8217;s a couple of paths here and maybe steer them to one particular path.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, that&#8217;s a lot of what it is, is what&#8217;s the best path for you? [00:16:00] You know, it, you may be, uh, if there&#8217;s these three or four very important things, which one would benefit you the most?  </p>



<p>You know, let&#8217;s go there first and then we can go back to the three or four important things. That&#8217;s, there&#8217;s no static list of what&#8217;s best. Mm-hmm. I mean, there&#8217;s a static list of, um, what&#8217;s good. But what&#8217;s best? I mean, that depends. What do you, what do you need? Are you interested in growth? Are you interested in converting, are you interested in education?  </p>



<p>You know, those are all very different, very different things.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> And you said too, like depth. So there&#8217;s someone here at the organization has these strategic goals, things they want to do, um, but the depth part, and that&#8217;s where, you know, Online work is pretty deep. It&#8217;s so nuanced. There&#8217;s so much stuff going on.  </p>



<p>Right. In your post, you mentioned, you know, performing well in the search engine, the SEARCHs, the search engine results, um, speed. Mm-hmm. All those kind of things they probably don&#8217;t think about. And the work I&#8217;ve done or helped [00:17:00] with, um, Lindsey&#8217;s, my wife&#8217;s Lindsey that you know real well. Um, what&#8217;s her marketing agency is love her.  </p>



<p>That&#8217;s about it. They understand strategic strategy, that what they need to do and what they need to get accomplished, but don&#8217;t always have that level of depth in-house. Mm-hmm. And we were talking before we got started on the recording here, about kind of the changing roles of like, the importance of having vendors out here.  </p>



<p>Mm-hmm. That. You know, to hire someone with this type of expertise is probably gonna be pretty hard. Uh, at almost any level. There&#8217;s obviously enterprise, you know, companies that have whole teams that do web stuff. But still probably, I think, and I&#8217;ve seen from our membership at Post Status still outsource a lot of the depth we&#8217;re talking about because yes, it&#8217;s hard to hire a WordPress professional that knows all these things and run this gamut.  </p>



<p>Mm-hmm. And we were talking specifically about this role. Um, my view is, [00:18:00] When I was helping a client a couple years ago, uh, they&#8217;d often referred to me, I was doing consulting with him as a vendor, and I&#8217;d go, but. But I feel more, I care about the mission and goals of what you&#8217;re trying to get accomplished.  </p>



<p>Mm-hmm. And I don&#8217;t think of myself as just someone that comes in, slots in, doesn&#8217;t work, comes back out leaves. Yep. Uh, I might have multiple clients and stuff, and I think that has to shift a little bit because of the nature of the work that we&#8217;re doing, that you can&#8217;t maybe just hire a professional that has all that.  </p>



<p>I need 10 of those with all the verticals you could think. Right. And so we&#8217;re kind of talking about that shift and that&#8217;s where that see Vale, you&#8217;re truly not a vendor, you&#8217;re partner mm-hmm. In what you&#8217;re doing with them. Like you&#8217;re saying, stick to what you do best. We&#8217;ll take this part, these parts that you don&#8217;t do best and go deep in those.  </p>



<p>And, and I&#8217;m curious your thoughts about all that. You mentioned fractional, so I, I&#8217;m curious what your perspective is of this shift and what you see in the market.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Oh. [00:19:00] Um, I think it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s similar to the, the culture shift, uh, within companies where they want everybody to have culture, but they don&#8217;t necessarily hire based on culture, you know?  </p>



<p>Um, I think, um, building, um, building a team, people talk about fractionals now, right? Oh, fractional cmo, fractional, CFO, and. It, it implies that something&#8217;s broken. I don&#8217;t know, just the language, you know, like fractional. I don&#8217;t need you all the time. I just need you to solve these specific problems. But that&#8217;s inherently broken in and of itself in that, um, you&#8217;re not incorporating someone into the big picture.  </p>



<p>I think of it sort of, uh, my kiddo play soccer, right? So you have these forward positions, these midfield positions, and these, these defensive positions. And not everybody plays at the same time, but they&#8217;re all very important to have on the field. I mean, I wouldn&#8217;t call one a fractional forward, right? I wouldn&#8217;t call one a fractional defender.  </p>



<p>They [00:20:00] know their positions deeply and they operate with the other team members in a way that. Is holistic. It makes sense. You know, they, they work together and they do their job when the time comes. So instead of fractional, um, you know, it, it&#8217;s like a world of fractionals. Now everybody&#8217;s fractional. Um, but if, if we could just reposition the way that vendor relationship, that vendor ideal.  </p>



<p>The, the, oh, you&#8217;re a contractor. No, you, you, if you hire for, for depth in a specific subject matter, then you have a defender standing on the back line. Waiting for their time to, to come in. They know their job. They know their, and you don&#8217;t have to sit up there as forward worrying about will this person be able to handle, handle that role in that, in that attack that&#8217;s coming on.  </p>



<p>Right. So it&#8217;s a mindset shift, I think, for the businesses, and I think it&#8217;s a struggle because. I mean, what? It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s either part-time work or full-time work, right? All of our employment and labor laws are, are based around [00:21:00] 32 hours or 40 hours a week. You have to give people a certain amount of breaks after if they&#8217;ve done so much work.  </p>



<p>You know, this is how the world was built. This is how our, our knowing and understanding of working is. So, uh, I think it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s probably a little more high level than thinking about this idea of fractional and having someone come in and tell me what I need to do and then let me work on it. Um, you know, you, you bring someone in to give you good advice and then map out the action steps.  </p>



<p>And if you&#8217;re capable and you have a team member to do that, then fine. But don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t think I can&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t need a full-time, um, you know, financial officer e who does, you know, I mean, unless you have a huge company, no one&#8217;s sitting there flipping through spreadsheets all day long, making sure that your numbers are in the right column in the spreadsheets, right?  </p>



<p>They, that that financial officer often acts in other capacities. So what&#8217;s the difference, right? If you have a vendor that just doesn&#8217;t do that all the time for you, you pay them whatever that time is worth and valuable to you to do what [00:22:00] you need them to do effectively. And that&#8217;s okay. It doesn&#8217;t need to be defined as anything other than teamwork.  </p>



<p>Uh, but that&#8217;s a hard concept to wrap your mind around when you&#8217;re in a traditional business setting. Does that make sense?&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Oh, it does. It illuminated so much for me with that. I think it&#8217;s an analogy, but, um, if, you know businesses are in a game, Organizations are in a game to do something, make money, whatever those.  </p>



<p>You know, from your nonprofits too, is make impact too. Um, but you think about that if the game is business or like soccer. Right. I loved when you said that you st you need certain players on the field to accomplish that and I love that how you said like a defender back here might not. Be the one that everybody thinks about.  </p>



<p>You know, the one that&#8217;s gonna score the goal, but you need someone with the goal going so the ball goes over the heads and you&#8217;re someone there to do this role. And I, I love that. Cause I think it really paints it very beautifully. You&#8217;re trying to do that shift you talked [00:23:00] about too. You need to fill the whole team.  </p>



<p>Mm-hmm. And you need certain players on the team to get that job done. And I love that, like valet in this instance might have four players. On the team. Mm-hmm. Um, that, that quote aren&#8217;t full-time employees, obviously, but you still need those, you need a goalie back here. You need, uh, those degrees,  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> right. We can still supply you with technical depth.  </p>



<p>We can supply you with design depth. We can supply you with content depth. You know, it, that, that&#8217;s the, that&#8217;s the benefit of the different players on the field, whereas you&#8217;re not hiring one person to do SEO 24 hours. You know, a day, uh, or eight hours a day, 40 hours a week rather for going with the working analogy.  </p>



<p>But the, the idea is you, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not any less important to have. To have that available.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, if you use this, I might just kind of continue to, to, to expand on this cause I love it.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Should we say football? Uh, do we have an international audience, should we say?&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> [00:24:00] I, I think soccer&#8217;s pretty international so we can stay there.  </p>



<p>Soccer, I just don&#8217;t know as much about soccer, but I&#8217;ll say like, If you think about there as offensive players, and I&#8217;m not sure what they&#8217;re called in soccer, but they&#8217;re the ones that need to go score the, score the goals, hit the hit the goal, hit the mission that you&#8217;re trying to do. The way I think about that before this conversation was stay in your core genius.  </p>



<p>What&#8217;s the thing that people come to you? Because that&#8217;s the word, the magic happens, right? Those are the people you probably might need to continue to retain as a full-time employee, as part of your team.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Well, that&#8217;s your marketing director, right? That&#8217;s your person. That&#8217;s the attacker going up, scoring the goals they know.  </p>



<p>They&#8217;re supported. The ball has been passed up to them. A beautiful cross from, you know, your tech team or your, your content writing team, whatever supports your mm-hmm. Your major goals that you got going on. And then they, they dive right in and. Kick one in the corner of the net because they know, they know the, the, the consumer base.  </p>



<p>They know your customers, they know your keywords. They know what your strategy should be. They know where you wanna go next, you know, and then someone else helps them implement [00:25:00] that. That&#8217;s the most powerful. It&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s no longer a, a game of, uh, how many balls can I juggle, and how many skills can I put on my resume?  </p>



<p>It&#8217;s. It&#8217;s how, how much time have I spent on this one skill has become, um, I, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s valued as much as it should be. It&#8217;s something that businesses value in vendors, which I find very interesting. But they don&#8217;t necessarily value in, in immediate hires, I think some, as much as they should.  </p>



<p>Mm-hmm. You know, vendors. How, how many times have you, have you, uh, drawn a red balloon for a company in the healthcare space like me? Right? Is that really important or should you be more concerned about. What kind of tools do I use to draw my red balloon? What color red am I using? You know, is there a specific healthcare friendly color palette that we&#8217;re using or, or those sorts of things that are, that are supportive of, of the skill that I&#8217;ve spent so much time working on design, and can I make a realistic balloon?  </p>



<p>Doesn&#8217;t matter if I&#8217;ve drawn 500 of them, if they look like. Anime and that&#8217;s not what you want then. Mm-hmm. You know, it doesn&#8217;t really help you out any. Right. Do you want a realistic [00:26:00] balloon then? Yes. I&#8217;ve drawn hundreds of realistic balloons in many different colors. Or, you know, it&#8217;s, I&#8217;m probably going off the rails with that, but point being, it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s not valued as much, uh, with vendors or, or, uh, it&#8217;s not valued much with instant hires as much as it&#8217;s required of vendors.  </p>



<p>Right. You have, you have to have this very deep and specific knowledge. Well, you hire, you hire in-house, and you want someone to have 17 skills. I&#8217;ve seen so many LinkedIn, WordPress, uh, job postings in the last couple of months, especially with the flood in the market. And it&#8217;s like, must have deep knowledge of c s s must be able to project, manage and communicate effectively across team members must be able to, uh, turn concepts into action plans and must know css.  </p>



<p>Do you know if you want anybody to know? Sorry. You know, if you want anybody to know those things deeply enough to do them effectively at well, You know, with all of the cross browser, um, things that you need to know and, and accessibility and, and all that kind of stuff, like, [00:27:00] that&#8217;s a big, big ask. Yeah. Big ask for one human.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Absolutely. And that, that&#8217;s just defining that role too of agency. You think about what you do at Val as you find, recruit, train, uh, hire all those, those professionals that fit that job description. But would go, I probably wouldn&#8217;t be as interested doing that role at an organization, but that you find a team of those there.  </p>



<p>You&#8217;re doing all of that work that takes time, energy, all that expertise to do all that. Why not let it over here? And you think about, there&#8217;s one note you mentioned in the job skills. It&#8217;s like being able to communicate across team. It&#8217;s like that&#8217;s your role as CEO of valet is to make sure that your team here of experts.  </p>



<p>Inward press in particular are communicating as a team back to customers. So like why would you take that extra cognitive load too, would be my thought. Stick to the things you do best, the things that, [00:28:00] what you&#8217;re scoring the goals back to soccer, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re the star. Those stars do that for them. What you get to do for those that are the backstop, the defenders, like you said back there.  </p>



<p>I, I, to me I think that&#8217;s way more efficient and realistic. Um, because we know, uh, Lindsay is in the process of hiring under pressure right now, and it just takes so much time to source, find, go through the vetting process, have those co, it&#8217;s just extremely time intensive. And then when we&#8217;re talking to the pre-roll, it&#8217;s like, You know, oftentimes when you&#8217;re hiring somebody, you wanna find the right fit, but you, you always end up, uh, onboarding, training, guiding those people to do the best for what you&#8217;re trying to do as an agency.  </p>



<p>And, uh, I just go, that&#8217;s a lot of effort. We&#8217;ve at, at our previous company, at Themes. That&#8217;s what we did. We hired experts. The things that we weren&#8217;t good at, couldn&#8217;t be good at to, couldn&#8217;t even be. Close to good at find experts with experience and [00:29:00] expertise, pull them in and like back to soccer, I go, the coach is your CEO, your marketing manager out there that needs to execute, but should spend majority of their time on those star players on their team.  </p>



<p>And then source the rest of their team through quality people that are worrying about that all the time. To me, that just feels like no-brainer, by the way, Kimberly. But you know, I&#8217;m, uh, I say I&#8217;m biased, but I just look at it from a business perspective and I go, I like this trend, uh, where that typical vendor relationship should get an enhancement.  </p>



<p>You shouldn&#8217;t think about. Well, You know, they get paid from valet or whatever it is, whatever agency. They&#8217;re not part of our team. But if you think about it and find an agency like Valet that really cares, wants to do a great job and play that role on their team, hey, I think we should upgrade that, that.  </p>



<p>Mindset and approach and attitude of contractors, vendors, and say, well, are they part of our [00:30:00] team? They might be fractionally part of our team, but we don&#8217;t need them a hundred percent of the time. Right. And that&#8217;s where I think about what, what you all offer, and I&#8217;ve told you this for years, I love what you offer because it&#8217;s not just maintenance, it&#8217;s not just these things that you can probably get.  </p>



<p>A number of agencies. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s understanding that mindset, playing those roles on the field for your client. Mm-hmm. Because you all do. And I wanna talk about that. I wanna shift gears a little bit about what you do, because I think your approach is pretty awesome, authentic, I think you all created this category.  </p>



<p>Um, and, but you do it to this level, high level that is, Not just, well, but if you just maintain my website and my updates and my plugin themes, all that kind of stuff, that&#8217;s cool. But it doesn&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t to me go that to be that player on the field. Could you talk a little bit about the holistic service?  </p>



<p>Cause you said in the, in the beginning, end to end, it&#8217;s really compelling, but what does that mean?&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Okay, well we had many iterations of this. I think we had the [00:31:00] website, health pyramid, and then we had these pillars at one point. Um, but it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s really the idea that, um, expanding on the, the beliefs of what different stakeholders in a business can do for the, or the website can do for them.  </p>



<p>It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s kind of the flip side of that in the tech stack where now, because there are so many different things required, And so many different niches and expertise and all of these people that follow that you can follow that say, I can tell you how to do X really well. Uh, but that&#8217;s one out of a thousand things that your website does or one out of a thousand things that your, your marketing manager does really end to end is, is conceptual in, um, conversion traffic or can people use your website?  </p>



<p>Is the tech stack healthy? Um, are you performing? You know, are there any opportunities for improvement? But it&#8217;s iterative, right? Because as you, as you grow, as you change things, you need to go back and kind of reevaluate all those. It&#8217;s a [00:32:00] shifting. I haven&#8217;t been able to find a really good graphic for it.  </p>



<p>And I feel like even the pyramid, when we had it, it was probably, it was good, but it wasn&#8217;t the best. Um, still it wasn&#8217;t the most accurate way of, of kind of, Displaying and visually how these things shift, uh, with new people, new processes, new ideas, new initiatives within a company. You know, it, there&#8217;s always something that you, you can look at and there&#8217;s always something to revisit.  </p>



<p>And then when you tie in metrics, right? We started doing these data dashboards and you start tying in metrics and looking at things that you can actually measure and set goals with. Um, you know, then it becomes a whole new ballgame. Well, now you&#8217;re, now you&#8217;re tweaking. Now you&#8217;re, you&#8217;ve entered Formula One and.  </p>



<p>You know, you&#8217;re moving little tiny notches on the engine to get that extra, you know, half a second off your start time or your run time, uh, because you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re really in the big leagues at that point, right? So, um, but even, even in the smaller, the smaller, um, medium business sector, there&#8217;s a lot of people that don&#8217;t realize that [00:33:00] there&#8217;s a lot of layers.  </p>



<p>Uh, good example. Um, we have a wonderful client. Who was looking at their Google page speed times. And of course, we all know it&#8217;s a rabbit hole, right? I want a hundred. No, you don&#8217;t want a hundred, you can&#8217;t get a hundred, uh, for many reasons. But, um, you know, and even if you do, it doesn&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t, if you get a hundred, it doesn&#8217;t knock up your, your search engine ratings, right?  </p>



<p>So, you know, what are you actually going for there, right? But, um, we&#8217;re looking at some page speed, low times and had to have a, a big discussion about. Image sizes on a page image weight. So how big the actual file size is. Also, you&#8217;re using a page builder also you&#8217;re using, um, this thing in here. Also, you&#8217;re maxing out two PHP workers every week, um, with the stuff that you need on your tech stack.  </p>



<p>So it&#8217;s not the hosting that&#8217;s your problem necessarily, but you could be giving your hosting an easier time. So all these things intertwine. They intermix. I had an email [00:34:00] today. You know, uh, I need to move hosting, um, but also wanna do registration and, and webinars later. Glad you mentioned that because just hosting and hosting with webinars and registration for things is, you know, those are two different considerations.  </p>



<p>You need two different things. So, um, it&#8217;s is a, a big. A big thread that runs through all of these things that you need as far as user experience, um, accessibility, usability, tech stack, speed, performance, you know, I mean, optimization, you know, there&#8217;s a lot of, a lot of, a lot of things that overlap. You can&#8217;t just kind of dive deep into one anymore, so you need that end to end where people, you know, you may not.  </p>



<p>Need to dive into all of those things. But you need to, to understand or work with someone who understands that those are all part of the equation. When you&#8217;re having a conversation, it&#8217;s not hitting a hammer, I&#8217;m not hitting a nail with a hammer. You know, you&#8217;re mm-hmm. You&#8217;re looking at, you know, an entire piece of furniture that you&#8217;re trying to put together.  </p>



<p>So if you [00:35:00] cut this one part, maybe those four things fall down. Um, or if you add something here, maybe you weaken another part of the structure. What if we put something here, we can bolster everything. You know, so having that comprehensive knowledge of that&#8217;s what end-to-end, I get in, in, in my words, my many words mm-hmm.  </p>



<p>Means,&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> well, we, we talked about the first is like if a web, the website, your organization&#8217;s website is vitally important to your strategy and what you&#8217;re trying to get done. You need someone to go to that has depth of knowledge and breadth. Of, of services that can get you to where you&#8217;re going. So I think at some point you&#8217;re part mechanic, part your tuner upper performance.  </p>



<p>Um, but it&#8217;s like when you are trying to, to do something that&#8217;s integral to your business, that involves your WordPress website, that&#8217;s where valet comes in and why this is compelling to me, cuz you know, one of our, uh, the businesses we have an investment in, we brought to valet because we go, she doesn&#8217;t [00:36:00] need, um, development all the time.  </p>



<p>Right, but sometimes she needs functionality, new features, new things for the website to get done what she&#8217;s trying to get done. And that was why it was so compelling that you also offer bundles. I think of development time where you know, to try to hire that out or try to do a full-time employee is gonna be, I think, near impossible.  </p>



<p>But I love that cause it was co so compelling. She might need this month, three hours of development type work. Well, they have someone to go to that&#8217;s trusted, trained, great communicators to do all that, to get it done. And that&#8217;s why that end ends so interesting. Cause I know in the health pyramid that we talked about, uh, a while back, um, you&#8217;re thinking about all, all, all the way to analytics and metrics.  </p>



<p>To features and functionality too. I just need to create a new page that has these things to, to promote my new, you know, offering those types of services. That&#8217;s what you all offer and I think that&#8217;s [00:37:00] why Vale is really compelling in the space. I wish not to get you just more competitors here, but I wish there was more people that understood like businesses and organizations need this.  </p>



<p>They can&#8217;t, they&#8217;re not just gonna go higher, you know, develop, develop full-time developer rates right now are. Insane. They&#8217;re pretty, and I&#8217;m glad because our professionals are worth it, but that you&#8217;re like, I, I couldn&#8217;t even think 120, $150,000 a year to just get someone that knows the stuff. But from a fractional, time wise, I can get those three, that expertise in bundles just when I need it.  </p>



<p>Mm-hmm. Um, and then someone that knows all the way from development to metrics, health analytics, performance that understands the connection of faster spot site equals. SEO equals more traffic equals potentially more conversions in that holistic way, I think is pretty, pretty and compelling. Yeah.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Being able to give advice with, um, [00:38:00] with a, with all of that depth of experience.  </p>



<p>There&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s a story, um, The guy with the hammer that goes to work on a, on a submarine. Have you heard that one? Uhuh? Uh, there&#8217;s, um, they&#8217;re working on a submarine and, and this guy just can&#8217;t quite get, uh, the backend, the propeller work in something&#8217;s going on with it. So he, he goes through his Rolodex and finds this propeller specialist.  </p>



<p>That, that he knows that they&#8217;ve called it in the past when they&#8217;ve hit really, really tough problems. Cuz he is gotta get the submarine work in, he wants to get it going. He, this is the one thing that he just can&#8217;t, you know, solve for some reason. And so he calls the guy in and the guy comes in, he is got this giant toolbox and he spends about 10 minutes looking, poking around, moving some things.  </p>



<p>And he opens up his toolbox and pulls out this teeny tiny hammer and he walks up to the propeller, moves his finger around just a little bit and taps on it twice. And he says it&#8217;s fixed and the guy goes up and he, you know, kind of spins it, oh my gosh, this is great. You fixed it. We can get going. You know, this is a huge piece [00:39:00] of machinery.  </p>



<p>This is a huge project we&#8217;re working on. This is a huge initiative. And the guy says, okay, I&#8217;ll send you an invoice. So he sends him an invoice for $40,000 and the guy was like, he calls him up, he&#8217;s like, man, $40,000. Are you kidding me? And he goes, oh, I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll send you an itemized invoice. And it was like, you know, um, uh, $10,000, you know, for my time, and then $30,000 knowing where to tap with the hammer.  </p>



<p>Uh, you know, it&#8217;s that, it&#8217;s that whole idea of, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s that&#8217;s valued as much, you know, as it was because there&#8217;s so many specialists. Everybody&#8217;s a specialist. So why would you value, um, someone with a, with a broad based knowledge of, of an industry as much as you used to?&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, well if you, if you&#8217;re getting married and won a piano player for your wedding, you gotta take into account that person has been probably spending decades.  </p>



<p>Yep. Learning the piano, learning the, the music. Practicing. Practicing to understand and back to the [00:40:00] summer music, exactly where they hit.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> I&#8217;m pretty sure there&#8217;s like a, a Reddit thread with like, all kinds of stories like that. Right? Where what do you mean you, you know, you only gonna, you wanna charge me $250?  </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a one hour wedding, you know, well, classically trained, but okay.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, so far we talked about the value of the website growing in importance, and so glad to hear that what you&#8217;re seeing too, what we&#8217;re seeing. Um, we&#8217;ve talked about that role of the classic vendor changing, um, in a good way. Finding agencies like we have at Word at, uh, post status WordPress agencies, like Valet has been doing it for.  </p>



<p>Gosh, how, how long have you been doing this, Valerie? I, I said Val and smash it together. Kimberly,&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Valerie, it&#8217;ll be my new screen name. Um, a about a little over 10 years. Yeah. It&#8217;s been, it&#8217;s been a long time.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> No kidding. Years. You&#8217;ve seen a lot too. Yeah, so [00:41:00] finding that agency, it has the depth of experience, has the team that can execute, has that knowledge to be that back to the soccer, to be a player or multiple players on your field, so you get to focus on what you do best.  </p>



<p>I think that&#8217;s credible and, and that just, I think, for me is a perspective on our industry, particularly with WordPress. But on the internet, the. Increasing value of, um, both websites and agencies that can do that. Take that down for you. Anything else we missed that you wanna share or, or talk about?&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Yeah, we, uh, we soft launched a, a new, um, a new.  </p>



<p>Refresh of the site. Um, we had to readjust our plans based on this, this conversation actually that we&#8217;re having just kind of this change in shift in market, being able to provide more core competencies, um, that are highly skilled. Um, [00:42:00] and then we&#8217;ve kind of, we&#8217;re toying around with a new version of a smaller package.  </p>



<p>That we&#8217;re calling Valet Express. Uh, that kind of gets you a lot of the core things that you need, um, covers that, you know, the, the gives you the basics of the end-to-end. To be able to at least see and look at things. You know, if you want help with them, then you can get help with them, if not, but, um, our, our standard plans have shifted and now include an advisor, um, for the larger ones, uh, to meet at least two times a year.  </p>



<p>So we can kind of stay up to date, keep up with, you know, funding cycles and, you know, uh, group initiatives and, you know, be able to help plan and that kind of stuff. So, um, really excited because I mean, we, we act in an advisory capacity anytime we talk to someone, you know, make an email and an ask a question anytime they want.  </p>



<p>But, um, you know, being present for those, for those meetings and changes and, and discussions is something that we really wanna. Make ourselves more available for, we&#8217;re always [00:43:00] available for it, but we&#8217;re never like, Hey, it&#8217;s time for your six month meeting. You know, we make it more important. Uh, Then it, it smooths, it smooths the process a lot, and I think that&#8217;s a big part of us trying to contribute, to help shift that idea of being, uh, invested.  </p>



<p>We know that we love what we do, and I think that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re good at it is just because we like helping. We like learning. We&#8217;re not invested in selling anything in particular other than just being there, you know, and doing it. Right. We&#8217;re just nerds for. We&#8217;re trying to get it right and, and figure it out.  </p>



<p>Mm-hmm. So, you know, that&#8217;s what makes us passionate. So, um, you know, we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve done a, a little bit of, uh, kind of adjusting. There&#8217;s still more to come, but that was kind of the first. The first big push. There&#8217;ll be lots of other little changes and things we&#8217;re gonna grow and add in. But, uh, you know, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s been exciting.  </p>



<p>I&#8217;m so happy.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I&#8217;m so excited. That&#8217;s great. Well, somebody&#8217;s like, Hey, I need a nerd to help how all this fits in. Um, how do they get started and talk, get started talking to you all at Vale. What&#8217;s the next step?&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Oh, [00:44:00] we have a contact form on the website. We have a phone call scheduling on the website now, and you can just, hello@valet.io rhymes.  </p>



<p>So it&#8217;s easy to remember, uh, and, you know, we&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll talk to you, you know that any, every conversation has to be, um, started with an idea of what you wanna do, where you wanna go, and what your goals are. I mean, that&#8217;s, that makes for the most effective communication. Um, so yeah, that&#8217;s the best way. Just say, hey, and we&#8217;ll say, Hey, what you doing?  </p>



<p>What you wanna do? And we&#8217;ll go from there.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I love it. I think that last part is key. Knowing what you want to do, where you want to go, and then coming to the website advisors vale to figure out how to get there. Absolutely key. Thank you. Kimberly Lepar of valet, CEO. Um, I appreciate your time sharing what you&#8217;re seeing in the market and how you all help connect in with, um, clients for this cool thing we call the Open Web and WordPress.  </p>



<p><strong>Kimberly Lipari:</strong> Yes. Love it. It&#8217;s a place to be.</p>

<p><a href="#h-transcript">Transcript</a> ↓</p>



<p>In this episode, <a href="https://twitter.com/coreymaass">Corey Maass</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/corymiller303">Cory Miller</a> move from personal to professional. They offer impactful transparency, from discussing the importance of website speed, user experience, and SEO to practicing mindfulness and finding balance. They share insights on optimizing WordPress websites for performance, including hosting, caching, and image optimization tips. They also discuss the role of content in driving traffic and engagement, as well as strategies for leveraging social media to grow an online presence.</p>



<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Imposter Syndrome.</strong> Imposter syndrome is very common among people who work in tech, and it&#8217;s important to acknowledge it and understand that it&#8217;s okay to feel this way. It&#8217;s helpful to talk to others about your feelings and to remind yourself of your accomplishments and skills. It&#8217;s important not to compare yourself to others and focus on your progress and growth. Seeking support from a therapist or coach can be very helpful in managing imposter syndrome.</li>



<li><strong>Slow Hustle.</strong> Take a more intentional, thoughtful, and sustainable approach to work and life. Instead of constantly hustling and working long hours, “slow hustle” focuses on balancing work and rest, taking breaks, and being intentional about your work. Finding a pace that works for you helps in avoiding burnout. “Slow hustle” can help you find more fulfillment and purpose in your work and can be beneficial for long-term success.</li>



<li><strong>Personal Brand. </strong>Building a personal brand can help in various aspects of life. Establish your personal brand by identifying and highlighting your unique skills and strengths, being authentic and consistent, and cultivating relationships. Use social media and online platforms to share your expertise and connect with potential clients or collaborators. Continually invest in your personal and professional development, whether through learning new skills, attending conferences, or seeking mentorship or coaching. Remember the importance of maintaining a positive and professional online presence and reputation, as this can greatly impact your personal brand and career success.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper" id="h-transcript">Transcript</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Session 11 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> [00:00:00] Um, we are on session 11, and this is gonna be a fun one. We&#8217;re kind of in rebooting. Last week we talked about, um, blew out the vision and see all the options. And then, um, got some good stuff there. And now I think next step is, um, drum roll. Taking a lane.  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yes. Uh, you know, when in, when in, we are a startup, right?  </p>



<p>Like we, we ride razor scooters around our office. Uh, we have a kegerator in our co-working space. String lights. We have string lights, like all the cool kids. Um, we are pivoting. Pivoting is what you do. Oh, there you go.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, I think we talked about, uh, Silicon Valley on H B O [00:01:00] and uh, I actually had a yellow Ford Escape.  </p>



<p>I was driving. It was my commuter car. And uh, it was funny, my team was making fun of me about it cuz uh, ATO, Avi&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Aviato.  </p>



<p>Well, so yeah, the, I think, and I think last time we summarized a bit about how we&#8217;ve arrived here, where the idea came from. Um, and so I, I have a couple of updates that I could start with. Um, the first is, I. Released, uh, an update of Crop Express, um, the, our, our legacy product, um, and or our lead gen product or what have you, um, that now has, uh, there was a, I had not successfully, correctly [00:02:00] implemented the constraints.  </p>



<p>Size constraints. And so that is fixed. Um, and it also now has the, our updated readme that you and I put together from the last call or the call before. Um, and so to me, I want to add one more feature that we had talked about, which was basically a, a, um, power user bypass. Because I even at one point I was like, oh, I, you know, I need an, uh, a circle image cropped, let me quick use my own tool.  </p>



<p>And I went in and it like, you know what it output was, I don&#8217;t remember. 2000 or something. And I was like, wait, this isn&#8217;t, this isn&#8217;t what I want. Like, I want to be able to say, you know, real quick, like we talked about, use it anywhere. Like, just make it a thousand, you know? And so I&#8217;m gonna add, um, a simple dropdown.  </p>



<p>I think what I [00:03:00] wanna do is, Like, first of all, it doesn&#8217;t tell you anywhere in the cropper what it, what size it&#8217;s gonna output it at. Um, uh, you know, you&#8217;ve potentially set that in the setting screen, but you haven&#8217;t, you don&#8217;t know when you&#8217;re actually cropping. And so I want to add that. And then what I think I&#8217;m gonna do is add it as a dropdown.  </p>



<p>So it&#8217;s like this, you know, based on your settings, this is going to export as 2000 by 2000 or a thousand by a thousand or whatever. But in the dropdown I&#8217;ll have essentially like two x, three x four x, you know, 0.75 x 0.5 x. So it&#8217;ll be, you know, in the dropdown it&#8217;s like, this is going to export at 2000, but from the dropdown you can say 1000 and then bang, um, or something like that.  </p>



<p>So it&#8217;s just real simple. And then, um, and then if we want to, we can, you know, or total customize and put in, [00:04:00] you can put in. Whatever crazy numbers you want, but the idea of being, you know, quick and easy, you can do something slightly different or proportionately different, logically different.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Hey, gimme one second.  </p>



<p>I forgot to do this.  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Sorry. So we start over? Yeah, no, it&#8217;s fine. Um, yeah, so often awesome&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> confirmation cuz like, you value the product that you built, we did together, right? Um, enough to go, I&#8217;m using it, I want to keep using it. And I think that&#8217;s invaluable from a product perspective. Like mm-hmm you what, what&#8217;s there and want to make it, hone it for your own thing, which I think is such a great origin for any product.  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Well, and the whole eat your own dog food kind of situation of like, you know, I don&#8217;t want to open Photoshop and add a circle and da da. Like, this should just be easy. Yeah. Um, so, um, with [00:05:00] that, the other, the other thing I wanna do, but I is of lower importance at the moment is to redo Crop Express the website so that it, um, has all the new features and is set up the way we want it.  </p>



<p>But I think that&#8217;ll be a, a weekend hackathon slightly down the road since we are deemphasizing this, the website of it, implementation of it is further deemphasized. Um, so that&#8217;s that. And then, um, let me actually share my screen.  </p>



<p>Share. You see that? All right? Yeah. Okay, so, um, so as we talked about, I had gone somewhat far down the path of, uh, building a plugin that works against, uh, [00:06:00] screenshot Express, which is the screenshot SAS service, a API that I built. Um, so you&#8217;ll see reference to social images, which was just sort of the project name, um, that I started with.  </p>



<p>Um, but I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m so, um, me and my crazy colors, oops, sorry about the dogs. Um, me and my crazy eighties colors. Um, there&#8217;s screenshot express, so I&#8217;m actually pretty, um, pleased with myself, uh, with the implementation that I built initially. So, um, So here&#8217;s what we have so far, essentially is, um, by activating this, it, it should throw you to a welcome screen.  </p>



<p>It currently doesn&#8217;t, um, but it has this very cool, like the colors of the app. Um, and so you can either sign up for an account or you can log in. Um, [00:07:00] so naturally I&#8217;m going to just log in. Um, hopefully you can&#8217;t see my passwords.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um,  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> it signs you in. Um, it shows you what active licenses you have. If you have one already, um, you hit select and then great. It&#8217;s all saved. So that&#8217;s the onboarding. And obviously like that&#8217;s purely technical, but that&#8217;s, you know, all the steps involved with connecting yourself to the screenshot express service.  </p>



<p>Um, and so obviously up for much debate between the two of us, like how we wanna, what we want to call it, how much we wanna obfuscate that we&#8217;re actually using screenshot express, behind the scenes, all that stuff. But at least technically there it is. Um, and then, um, I ripped [00:08:00] out some of the stuff that I had, um, but I think you can, we can sort of illustrate at least the, what we&#8217;ve got in mind here.  </p>



<p>Um, and this is where I, I wanted to start talking through with you. Um, A first imagined workflow, right? So that in my mind, here&#8217;s how this works, right? So you&#8217;re like, I write a blog post and array block editor. Um, and then presumably you&#8217;d save draft or you&#8217;d publish, but let&#8217;s just publish for the sake of it, right?  </p>



<p>Um, and then you&#8217;re like, okay, now I want to promote my blog post. Um, oh, let me add a featured image, upload a file, um, testing nice pretty [00:09:00] landscape set featured image update. I don&#8217;t, this might work. This might not work. But anyway, um, so it&#8217;s like you&#8217;ve got a published blog post and then you say to yourself, okay, now I want to create.  </p>



<p>Images for sharing this to on Twitter and Facebook. Um, and so what I have so far in here, I have to go start, uh, whoops. Open.  </p>



<p>It&#8217;s always fun doing it. Live tech demo. N p m,  </p>



<p>no, of course this will work.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I&#8217;m trying to write some notes too when we get there. Um,  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> oh.  </p>



<p>Okay, not you. Next. CSS js. [00:10:00] Oh, welcome. Okay. Why are you not just working?  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> This is real life. Does this sound good?&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Um,  </p>



<p>it is real, real life social images. I am in the right place. Um, I have the stuff that I was deleting. Uh, it&#8217;s not admin, its build.  </p>



<p>I dunno. This should just work.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, while you&#8217;re doing that, I&#8217;m. I&#8217;m thinking about what you&#8217;d want in the end product. Mm-hmm. The basic. Mm-hmm.  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So plugin. Oh, I didn&#8217;t activate the plugin. Oh no, I did. It&#8217;s there. [00:11:00] Um, oh gosh. I don&#8217;t know. Okay, so whatever. Um, but the idea is, um, wait, I really wanted to show this to you. I frame,  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> go ahead. You, you keep looking.  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Oh, that&#8217;s what it was. I totally changed this. I totally changed this. Okay, so, um, so there&#8217;s no currently no menu item, but, um, because what I had changed was started doing it all in React and JavaScript, but I was like, you know what, let&#8217;s just do this in, in an easier way. So like that, that whole welcome screen is actually like, you&#8217;re actually hitting a button in the page, reloads.  </p>



<p>And it&#8217;s not the like cool Ajay way to do it, but who cares? It works. So, um, so let&#8217;s see. We do actually build, Hey there. It&#8217;s, so the idea being that, you know, somewhere on this screen you&#8217;re like, okay, it&#8217;s. [00:12:00] Ready to go or you know, here&#8217;s my blog post. There&#8217;s a big button somewhere. Or I had had it up here in the menu item that was like, you know, social images.  </p>



<p>So it&#8217;s like, okay, you&#8217;re ready to go now build your social images so it takes you to a screen, um, where something like this, right, like this is a dashboard. Um, so we can actually create these things. Um, Instagram card. Right. So like you&#8217;ve got things that you&#8217;re building and the idea being that you&#8217;re choosing a channel, which is what&#8217;s, so channel being Twitter, Facebook, something like that.  </p>



<p>Obviously we will introduce custom ones, but this is what defines the size, right? So like if it&#8217;s Twitter, 1300 by 900, no, 1600 by 900, if it&#8217;s Instagram, 10 80 by 10 80. Um, and then we&#8217;ve also got templates. And so right now I think I [00:13:00] only have, uh, like a simple. Simple one implemented. Um, but the idea is you then it takes you to an edit screen, right?  </p>



<p>So we are on, here&#8217;s my blog post. Um, and I need to, I need a name for what these are called. I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re called. Um, but you&#8217;ve got, um, you know, the template that you&#8217;ve started with, um, and you should be able to change this as you go. It&#8217;s like, oh, right, I&#8217;m no, I actually want this for Facebook or whatever.  </p>



<p>Right? And the template is, um, again, your starting point, but you&#8217;ve got the idea of being that you then got whatever&#8217;s customizable is this is your preview on the right. So again, here&#8217;s my blog post that was pulled in from the blog post, right? If you want the featured image as the background. Well, I didn&#8217;t implement that, so that&#8217;s not showing, but that&#8217;s what would show, you know, in the background.  </p>



<p>What I do have implemented is, um, if you wanted to show the ti the. The date of the post. [00:14:00] Yeah. Um, right. If you wanted to add a background color, let&#8217;s just make it red, right? So pretend your, you know, your featured image isn&#8217;t there. You can change the font. Um, you can change the size, right? So basically, like, based off of a template you would customize, um, what this looks like.  </p>



<p>So, you know, this is obviously not an accurate representation cuz we&#8217;re saying it&#8217;s Instagram, but pretend it&#8217;s Twitter, it&#8217;s the right proportions. You&#8217;ve got it customized on the right and then you, and then you&#8217;d hit a button that says print essentially, you know, stamp it, create it. Whatever that looks like.  </p>



<p>And then, um, you can go back to your dashboard and we would have the preview of it, um, as it was created. And so then here, or any, anywhere there&#8217;s a button that says download, you know, if it&#8217;s Twitter, then you&#8217;ve got a share directly to Twitter button, upload it to [00:15:00] Buffer kind of thing.  </p>



<p>Cool.  </p>



<p>So that&#8217;s the very clunky version. But you know, again, the, the, the walkthrough that I&#8217;m starting to picture is you create a, um, anything you create in here in WordPress, a post, a page, you then have a button that says, okay, use data from this to populate a template. So it&#8217;s the page title, copy excerpt. Um, You know, featured image, and then you bang through a bunch of templates, you&#8217;re like, oh, there&#8217;s a, the simple template that has the title on the bottom and the featured image is a background.  </p>



<p>You&#8217;ve got the card template that&#8217;s got the featured image above and the title below. You&#8217;ve got the, um, the Post Status template that, you know, you automatically inserts your logo on the left and your featured image on the right [00:16:00] with a title down below. You&#8217;ve got the whatev, what&#8217;s the other one we looked at?  </p>



<p>Um, Freemeus template, that&#8217;s got the flip art, you know, featured image on the right and the title on the left, and lots of white space, whatever, whatever. Um, you know, and you and each one, I guess I&#8217;m picturing, have you used, um, migrate DB Pro from Delicious Brains years ago? Yeah. Um, So they&#8217;ve got this real, you know, if you&#8217;re, um, so it&#8217;s, you know, migrating data from one site to another.  </p>



<p>So you go in and you say, start a new migration, and you plug in the credentials and you plug in your settings. And so you, at any point you can say, go do the migration, push the data, pull the data, um, or you can save this as a template so that you can, you know, go in regularly and say, pull in the data from the site, pull in the data, you know, it&#8217;s a new day.  </p>



<p>Pull in the n the fresh data. And so I&#8217;m picturing that kind of flow where, [00:17:00] um, you know, if, if all you need is, um, if all you need is a Twitter image, then click, click, click and you&#8217;ve got one. Um, but you know, while you&#8217;re in here, if you&#8217;ve got all this configured, there&#8217;s a button that says Save this, you know, as a template for every post.  </p>



<p>And so then the next time you come in here, you know, uh, create a thing from scratch or load your. You know, send it to Corey&#8217;s Twitter template, bang. And it, but again, it pulls in that post data populates your template. So it&#8217;s like your, your Post Status template where it&#8217;s like you&#8217;d set it up once with a logo on the left and your featured image on the right, you&#8217;d hit save.  </p>



<p>This is the Post Status, um, you know, person profile template. And then every time you just come in, drag that down and it automatically throw it on the screen. You could tweak it a little if you needed to, if the title was too long or something, and then hit print and then you&#8217;ve got that image.  </p>



<p>Cool.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> [00:18:00] So yeah, from a workflow standpoint, I think that&#8217;s very, uh, understandable. But this is around like a broader question that leads back to that, um, like the open graph and things like that. So, you know, when you paste the link into Slack or you paste it into Facebook or whatever that is, Um, it&#8217;s pulling some data back from the website,&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Correct .  </p>



<p>Most of it populated by something like Yost. Okay.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So how does Slack, Facebook, different things know which particular image? Like when you create a post and then you put that image in there, there&#8217;s multiple options and dimensions with the channels and stuff. So is that stored somewhere on the backend?  </p>



<p>Like if we, if someone goes, okay, I want it, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, how would that [00:19:00] automatically recognize in those platforms?&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Or does it Right? Um, yeah, we&#8217;d have to look into that. Like I know that I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve played with another tool before that generated an open graph image for your blog post. Um, and.  </p>



<p>They, I don&#8217;t remember if it worked or not. I feel like it didn&#8217;t work the way I wanted it to, but it, um, it hooked into Yost. So if you had Yost running, you didn&#8217;t have to say, generate an image and then download an image and then upload an image into Yost. There was a way that it was like that image was saved to the media library.  </p>



<p>And then, um, and then Yost, there was a hook somewhere, I&#8217;m sure in Yost, cuz they&#8217;re real good about that. That said, for the social image point at this one. Or maybe they, they, you know, maybe they updated the metadata, the Yost metadata or something like that. But, [00:20:00] um, but yeah, that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s like I, you know, this is this, like what I just showed is broadly the.  </p>



<p>Um, how we generate images, right? But I think like one of the onboarding things, kind of like Yost walks you through site basics, right? Like we would have some sort of onboarding as part, you know, connect to, to screenshot express. But then like, what do you want to buy? What do, what do you want your defaults to be?  </p>



<p>Create? And it&#8217;s honestly like, it would be a great, um, user onboarding because it&#8217;s like, okay, we&#8217;re gonna create, you know, every website full stop needs a default o OG open graph image. So let&#8217;s show you our little template builder and you&#8217;re gonna build your first template. You know, that&#8217;s your default website homepage, open graph image.  </p>



<p>Done, saved. [00:21:00] And then you can also save this as the default template that&#8217;ll get used for every post. But instead of pulling in the name of your website, it&#8217;ll pull in the name of your post done. And so if you check a box, um, then every post you create, you know, we can have it. Whenever you somehow indicate that you&#8217;ve published, you&#8217;re ready, then it&#8217;ll automatically create that open graph image by default.  </p>



<p>Um, and or, you know, any of these things we can get. I ideally you&#8217;d get to a point where, um, you know, you publish a post, you click, okay, I&#8217;m ready to promote it. There&#8217;s a good word. Like the next stage after creating a thing, a post, a page is to promote it, market it, whatever. You know, click a click here to generate all of the images you&#8217;ve already set up or add new ones or if, you know, if you wanna do it manually every time you can.  </p>



<p>But we could, we could automate a lot of that stuff so that it&#8217;s, you [00:22:00] know, cuz it, yeah, once you get down the road aways, it&#8217;s like the clients that I have that are publishing articles, you know, once or twice a day, presumably they, they might, they would spot check these things, these images created, but, um, but the likely the idea, ideally the, you know, they would click a button and an OG image would be created.  </p>



<p>And also like, if they open that dashboard screen, then it&#8217;s just like, download your Twitter image, download your, or click here to, to download all of them as a zip to then send to the social media manager or something like that.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So the reason I was asking is related back to workflow too. So you go, like, you, you hit on it.  </p>



<p>Where I was thinking there is like, there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s a site specific open graph thing that just gets populated and then each post has, uh, a nuance of [00:23:00] that kind. I mean, we&#8217;re kind of thinking like a thumbnail in a sense, but like for the social images, um, and back down the workflow, I almost go like, again, not knowing the technical part of this, but I go from a workflow standpoint.  </p>



<p>You created your blog post, you start your build thing and like you don&#8217;t even select a channel. It&#8217;s like here&#8217;s all like here&#8217;s LinkedIn, here&#8217;s Twitter, here&#8217;s Facebook. Yes, here&#8217;s Google things. And they&#8217;re already there and generated not even if you&#8217;re gonna like repost on LinkedIn or. Share, but like they&#8217;re already generated because maybe somebody does share your image on LinkedIn, not you.  </p>



<p>Right. And you want that to show up nicely. Yeah. Um, so that was just my thought is like, first I go, oh, that&#8217;s cool. He is already thought through all the channels, but then I was like, workflow wise, I just want &#8217;em built for me. And maybe I&#8217;m editing some of those.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. We, [00:24:00] you know, I think we define some friendly default and in an onboarding or a setup, we say, you know, by default we are creating, you know, Facebook being Facebook, they didn&#8217;t name it anything.  </p>



<p>They named it Open graph. Twitter came along second, so they have to call it a Twitter card. Um, They&#8217;ll be out of business soon. So it doesn&#8217;t really matter. But, um, but it&#8217;s like, you know, in the onboarding, we&#8217;ll say like, by default, do you want to j Auto generate Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram for each thing you create, yes or no, just toggle using a default, a sensible default.  </p>



<p>And then you can customize that template.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So I think about this with our Slack community because it comes in and like, it never looks the way we wanted to, and I just go, okay, [00:25:00] we can talk about the user options at some point, but I go, I would want every channel, uh, reasonable channel created because you don&#8217;t know if someone&#8217;s gonna put that into Slack or something else.  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> True, true, true.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> For the most popular networks. So like, even if you&#8217;re not using it, you think about your visitors and you go, it want, you want it to show up nice and, and look nice. Um, so that was my, that&#8217;s my thinking when I saw that is like, no matter what, this comes back to open graph, like how it, we create those and then they get tagged appropriately with open graph in, in that post.  </p>



<p>Um, I think would be an excellent work focus. Then we could say for the product standpoint, it generates this on, you know, automatically for all the, so that your site looks professional, right? Any, you know, any edge case that&#8217;s gonna happen. You&#8217;ve made in the design, you know, [00:26:00] automation almost, and then post by post, they can, they can edit this, but I like that mindset because then we can say, I was, I was looking up open graph, um, as you were talking just to kind of understand that more.  </p>



<p>And, um, I saw some, some little sample images that came in. I thought, okay, there&#8217;s some cool ideas here. Um, what we&#8217;re doing. If, if we look at the bigger view and this, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m really, this is tied back down to this workflow. What we&#8217;re trying to accomplish is, uh, an easy way to demonstrate an image or some concept of, this is my website where I have done this thing for you.  </p>



<p>It&#8217;s like a presentation. And, um, some of the images, I was like, oh, there&#8217;s so cool design ideas. But you think about it like, we&#8217;ll go way back to product mockups and like iPhone mockups. You know how they always tilt [00:27:00] &#8217;em. Mm-hmm. And I think we&#8217;re trying to do here, the essence of it is we have a website we do a lot of content for.  </p>



<p>And when we present that in the social channels or wherever it is, we want people to know this is an entity, this is a brand thing. Like, it&#8217;s as silly as the little iPhone mockup when it, you know, or remember those 3D book covers. It&#8217;s that 3d. Same. Oh yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It&#8217;s all 3D book covers you created, you know, 3D book cover of any PDF you had.  </p>



<p>It&#8217;s like almost in that sense. This is a website called Post or whatever. And you know, let me show you this real quick,  </p>



<p>but see, like this right here. See how it&#8217;s got the little top shadow? Yep. I&#8217;m not saying that&#8217;s how we do it design wise, but the intention is like these little dots are kind of a signal of this is a website, this is, you know, even, even some of the [00:28:00] updates, like I guess that&#8217;s Facebook, but you&#8217;re like, those are some interesting design thoughts for the templates.  </p>



<p>Mm-hmm. But see, that kind of thinking is you just made me professional on things I hadn&#8217;t even thought about. Yeah. Because you get to the other side and you see. Um, just like when we went live on Goda or YouTube, it&#8217;s got the default old Post Status logo and you&#8217;re like, what you really want is some semblance of branding for the website.  </p>



<p>Mm-hmm. And the content. So like this one right here kind of speaks more to the idea of what I&#8217;m talking about is like, that could be a template. Like we could&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Right. Well search for right where you are, search for open graph image template, like in, in, in the Google box at the top, like, uh, image template.  </p>



<p>Should get a bunch of stuff about [00:29:00] tags,  </p>



<p>but nothing too compelling. But yeah, I, I love what, where you&#8217;re going. Like we could.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Like this right here is, you know, there&#8217;s just a frame, like the image. Mm-hmm. I was thinking of it as like, I don&#8217;t know, but there&#8217;s a frame to the image we create. It&#8217;s kind of like displaying, this is on my website. This is Phil website, and I&#8217;m presenting it to you where like, you know, this, I mean, even the Facebook thing, this is kind of ubiquitous with like, there&#8217;s a name, there&#8217;s a logo.  </p>



<p>Yep. There&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s something here. There&#8217;s an image like this, this template format. It&#8217;s pretty standard. People get that. Yep. But even if you did something like logo, something like to give it a fill of this is on the web or something. Yeah, well, like the browser bar kind of thing, I guess.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Well, [00:30:00] and, and, and you can, I mean, my, my intention is I.  </p>



<p>Like, I don&#8217;t want to, I don&#8217;t want to compete with Canva, and I don&#8217;t want to get into that technical, I don&#8217;t wanna go that deep. Um, at least for a long time. We can&#8217;t of like drag and drop, but we can. But I&#8217;ve made it very, very easy to create templates. Um, and, um, and the intent is to use the, um, you know, uh, who does it, WooCommerce or, um, E D D or, um, any number of the big plugins.  </p>



<p>You can, you can copy a template out of a plugin, put it in your theme, and then it&#8217;ll get incorporated into the plugin. So it&#8217;s like, you know, VVA from FIUs is like, Nope, none of these templates do what I need. Um, you know, let me create my own. And so he is, he&#8217;s got a little, his little robot that&#8217;s, you know, pointing at.  </p>



<p>At a browser that has a screenshot of the [00:31:00] website built in, just like you said, um, or the little, you know, avatar of, of the author with their little byline, um, already built in. And, um, and incorporate those into, you know, every template that you, uh, that you create. And subsequently every screenshot of every or every social image that you create for anything.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I&#8217;m on this because we&#8217;ve been, like, I was just telling you I was at trying to do a frame for this, but I go, that&#8217;s really what we&#8217;re capturing. When you create a piece of do something, you, you package it up with a frame and then like, I&#8217;m just roughing this out cause I don&#8217;t have like any InDesign skills, but you go, there&#8217;s a frame up here that shows like,  </p>



<p>Kind of to, to this or this one using that. And then this is just the bar [00:32:00] that says this is a package thing. Then maybe, you know,  </p>



<p>I&#8217;m only diving into this cause I really think it, this could be really simple formula to start that would mm-hmm. Really greatly enhance anything I&#8217;ve done. Um, okay. So site logo. Yep. Name, you know, that kind of goes up there and then,  </p>



<p>and then down here.  </p>



<p>We know this be meta description maybe, or something like that. Or, uh, excerpt.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Excerpt. Yep.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> But like, if you think about that from the, just these elements for a second, right? Like, we packaged that up in a way that fills like this or mm-hmm. Like, don&#8217;t, we&#8217;re not in the Canva game. I mean, maybe you go do that or [00:33:00] maybe you just put it in the stock image.  </p>



<p>But that goes here, we pull this from , pull that from . There&#8217;s a link in there. You&#8217;ve got some simple branding. Oops.  </p>



<p>I&#8217;m trying to find the image to copy it. Cause I.  </p>



<p>Like that&#8217;s up here  </p>



<p>and everybody gets to see my awesome.  </p>



<p>But yeah, like in this, we&#8217;d only have to generate something like this. Like I could think we could get this lightly styled. Very right, very lightly styled. Pull in their logo name, have the big image here, and like I think that,  </p>



<p>I mean, gosh, that right there, Corey. Is a significant enhancement to anything most people are doing. It&#8217;s not custom, like, like these we&#8217;re seeing here where [00:34:00] someone, you know, has a full-time team doing this kind of stuff, but like, then we let them be creative with their own images. Hey, we&#8217;re not in that game.  </p>



<p>We&#8217;re in this game of packaging this content.  </p>



<p>And I mean, it&#8217;s like, you know, the, the Facebook one is the, this is the frame up here. That&#8217;s just the image. And this is just the title tag, headline, and description. Yep. That right there would significantly professionalize what we&#8217;re doing, you know? Mm-hmm. Uh, and then we&#8217;d have to stylize the, uh, generic one.  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yep. And that&#8217;s what I was trying to illustrate with like, so what you&#8217;d saw on the right of my little demo is, you know, the, the title of the blog post featured image in the back. So that&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s one, that&#8217;s one template. Right. And this kind of [00:35:00] thing would be another, or wrapped in a browser. Um, a fake browser would be another.  </p>



<p>And you know, so it&#8217;s, and if they&#8217;re simple to create, mostly done in, um, c s s, then it&#8217;s just a matter of somebody, me or you, or both of us, like essentially cranking these out. I mean, we don&#8217;t, we don&#8217;t want to overwhelm. The point is not to have a gajillion templates, at least not to start with, but a few sensible defaults that, like you said, give gives everybody their initial leg up.  </p>



<p>So like right out of the box, you&#8217;ve got a sensible default, something to work with.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Sorry, I can&#8217;t help myself.  </p>



<p>By the way, the circle logo, you can create with Crop Express.  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Give your big image of background color.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> When we first started doing that, I couldn&#8217;t remember how to do that.  </p>



<p>[00:36:00] Yep, there you go.  </p>



<p>I mean, even if you took the frame off.  </p>



<p>We probably want to play with these and see how they looked in the different social platforms, but,&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> right. Well, and that&#8217;s, and that&#8217;s the, the joy of this. So it&#8217;s, you know, so there&#8217;s, right now, like I just looked, LinkedIn uses, um, Facebook&#8217;s OG image, um, Instagram you can&#8217;t import. And so outta the box, we&#8217;re only talking about two.  </p>



<p>We&#8217;re talking about Facebook&#8217;s OG image and Twitter card image. So whatever their specs are. Um, and again, because it&#8217;s, we&#8217;re screenshotting, H T M L, it&#8217;s responsive. And so presumably you can use the same mo the same template. Yeah. You know, for both. And it&#8217;s like, okay, well no, I, I don&#8217;t want, I don&#8217;t want the, the Corey template.  </p>



<p>I want the Corey. [00:37:00] Template. It doesn&#8217;t work. Our names are the same. I don&#8217;t want the, the Corey template, I want the Miller template. And that one&#8217;s got a black background. You know, it&#8217;s black on white, so it&#8217;s like your themes on the right there, it&#8217;s like one is black on white, one is white on black, one is gray with, you know, little colors on it.  </p>



<p>Um, and so you&#8217;re like, that&#8217;s what all of my images look like for every post I create. It automatically creates a, um, Facebook or an OG image and a Twitter image. Um, as soon as I hit publish or even before, if I click a button and say, generate based on what&#8217;s, you know, the information that&#8217;s here. Um, and then like you said, as soon as somebody shares it, drops it into Slack, um, shares it via Twitter, Facebook, whatever, like, it&#8217;ll, it&#8217;ll pull in those, the image you want that&#8217;s been generated that is more than just your featured image.  </p>



<p>And then, yeah, we get into this kind of stuff where it&#8217;s like, [00:38:00] what are all of the d you know, these, this is where I guess the channels thing comes in, right? Like, so a channel could not only be, um, you know, technically, like Instagram is a, is a channel, but Instagram has stories which are a vertical 16 by nine to traditional Instagram, which is square.  </p>



<p>Um, you know, you can, you can share horizontal, vertical, or square on Twitter, LinkedIn Carousel is gonna have their own thing. Um, you know, what&#8217;s, what&#8217;s the optimal, you&#8217;re in Google Slides, what&#8217;s the optimal Google slide? Size and shape, like, so we can. Basically that&#8217;s where we once, once we have the, the way to present templates, we can go crazy creating templates for every single channel and every, every scenario.  </p>



<p>Yeah,&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I was just [00:39:00] thinking too, the option where you don&#8217;t have an image, but it creates one, an open graph type image for you. Mm-hmm. And what you want.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Um,  </p>



<p>well, and this is where we, um, um, we had talked about too, like, uh, you could have a template that looks at the content of the story for anything that&#8217;s in a block quote and pulls out the first block quote or pulls out every block quote and, and generates an image for each of those quotes. So now you&#8217;ve got.  </p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve got three block quotes, you&#8217;ve now got three images that are all sized and stylized for Twitter. And so then you say, okay, post this one today, this one tomorrow, and this one on Thursday  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> capture. This is just me capturing this.  </p>



<p>Like yeah. Even if it hadn&#8217;t open quote, like you don&#8217;t really have an image, but you have a powerful quote in [00:40:00] here. CSS can use some brain, like whatever your default site right is. Yeah.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Then it pull. I love that. You know, some basic styling. It&#8217;s pulling in your, I mean, Mo um, WordPress Customizer has a place for a logo so we can reach for it there, and otherwise we can say, specify a logo to use across all your templates.  </p>



<p>Um, And it&#8217;ll auto-populate. And then you can obviously drill down and, and customize each one as you, as you mess with it. Um, oras or mess with it as much as you want to.  </p>



<p>And so, um, so backing up, up, up, I&#8217;m creating a system for customizing a couple of templates to start with manually. And your, [00:41:00] let&#8217;s start with featured image kind of comment here to me, which I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m a hundred percent on board with, is the ability to set one of those essentially as a default so that it&#8217;s auto-generated so that the moment you hit publish your story has a handsome OG image.  </p>



<p>And we&#8217;ll see about hooking that into Yost or what have you. And then we can continue to take it further. Cuz it&#8217;s like, yeah, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s at least cover the basics base. Let&#8217;s cover the bases. Me and my sports metaphors. You&#8217;re that guy. Um, let&#8217;s at least do the basic of generating an an OG image, um, which is for better or worse, is the couple of other plug-ins or products that I&#8217;ve seen.  </p>



<p>That&#8217;s where they start. Um, but they also end there. So it&#8217;s like, great, let&#8217;s take it further than that of generating a Twitter card [00:42:00] image, but then also any other image you want. The, the workflow will start to get a little clunky because you are going to have to do something with those images. Upload them to buffer or.  </p>



<p>Upload them manually to Twitter or whatever, but at least those images exist, at least based off of, um, WordPress post data and a template. A template or templates that you&#8217;ve presumably built once and then said, save you can, the next time you publish a post, you hit, generate all these images, download a zip, and then you&#8217;re not, you don&#8217;t have to go to Canva and you don&#8217;t have to tweak, tweak, tweak or copy, you know, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, and tweak and insert your own data and stuff.  </p>



<p>They&#8217;re just, they&#8217;re just there. Yeah.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, like, uh, sorry, I, I was thinking too, here, here&#8217;s where I&#8217;m going with this too, is [00:43:00] I would imagine if we can create a, you know, my site, let&#8217;s say has 500 posts on there with no social images. Ooh. See where I&#8217;m going? Yeah. Install and it gives you a base, nicely styled, professional enough thing that can go backwards.  </p>



<p>Yep. Oh, now you&#8217;ve just made shit ton of work. Extremely easy and increased their professionalism. So what I was just doing was thinking about the Sitewide thing. It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s just a simple business card, you know? Yep. Here&#8217;s the logo, here&#8217;s the site, here&#8217;s our tagline. Like that might be it. Yep. Just what we&#8217;ve done, but we&#8217;ve hundred Xed this thing that exists that, you know, you go to all these sites and you&#8217;re like, God, they&#8217;ve got a whole team doing this stuff.  </p>



<p>Mm-hmm. We just hadn&#8217;t gone, boom, there&#8217;s&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> value, man. Oh, huge. And that&#8217;s [00:44:00] like, that to me is, um, Uh, another Delicious Brain&#8217;s product, the Offload s3. Um, and the free version lets you start today. The pro version among other things, lets you go, go back and essentially catch up.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> See, and that&#8217;s killer. I mean, imagine all these, okay, now we&#8217;ve hit our huge value prop because imagine all the WordPress website maintenance companies that go, by the way, we noticed your, your site is just not displaying too professionally.  </p>



<p>We&#8217;re gonna install this and click it and it&#8217;s done. Yep. Holy shit.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I mean, and even, even taking that a little further, like if I&#8217;m. Excuse me, I&#8217;m the agency. I come in or I&#8217;m the developer. I come in, I&#8217;m like, you know, yeah, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m building this thing for [00:45:00] you, but, um, we&#8217;re updating this thing for you. But like you said, I&#8217;ve noticed that, you know, a lot of these old pages don&#8217;t have these images, whatever.  </p>



<p>Um, I come in and I set styles. It&#8217;s like, what&#8217;s, what&#8217;s, like you said, what&#8217;s your logo? What&#8217;s your, um, brand colors? What&#8217;s your, you know, and so then it&#8217;s um, it&#8217;s all on brand too.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> It&#8217;s all on brand. And then like I meant any B2B site, so when it shows up, they might go  </p>



<p>like right there. They put incredible fingertip address. Like all the addresses. I mean, this is just nothing but a business card for your website, right? I&#8217;m gonna capture that for marketing.  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Um, and then, and then [00:46:00] WooCommerce, right? So, so every, every product you already have on your website, it just goes back through and, and populates and you know it, like we&#8217;ve said pre in a, in a previous call, um, you know, product image, bullet points. You probably don&#8217;t wanna do price, but you know, if you&#8217;ve got an if, if each of your products has bullet points or has reviews.  </p>



<p>So picture of image. Title of em or title of product, sorry, picture of product, title of product, 400 reviews, five stars and an excerpt. This widget is the best widget, you know,  </p>



<p>what do you do? What do you see? If[00:47:00]&nbsp;  </p>



<p>I go to Amazon, I want share this backpack, copy link. I go over to Post Status. I can find Corey. I say, this is the backpack I&#8217;m looking at.  </p>



<p>What does it do? What does it do? Apparently nothing.  </p>



<p>It just takes something to populate.  </p>



<p>Nothing. I feel like maybe slack&#8217;s being slow or something. Oops.  </p>



<p>Okay. So do you wanna share your window or all? No, I don&#8217;t have anything to share. I was just seeing, I, I went and grabbed a URL from Amazon and pasted it into Post Status. Um, To you to see what it would populate with, but it [00:48:00] didn&#8217;t actually populate anything.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, you know, a basic business card for your website basically is what we&#8217;re doing. And then the on top of that is, you know, something like this,  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> right? Yeah, exactly. And that&#8217;s what I mean by like, so part of the onboarding, which I think would be great cuz it helps people get set up is, you know, upload a logo or specify where a logo is. I mean, Yost does the same thing. Um, and, and so you, you, it&#8217;ll, it&#8217;ll give you the data points that it&#8217;ll give us the data, give the plugin the data points that it needs to build a sensible default.  </p>



<p>And, and so much. And then that&#8217;s your starting point for, you know, every time you wanna share, share a post, you know, start here. Well, no, this one actually [00:49:00] has a, a featured image. Let&#8217;s put that in. Or, you know, if it&#8217;s a, uh, you know, this is your business card for your website, but then, you know, it&#8217;s a woo commerce shop, so you actually want products.  </p>



<p>So it&#8217;s like, then you&#8217;d say, okay, we&#8217;ll copy this, this business card template, but then, you know, add, show the featured image or something  </p>



<p>and doing,&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I mean, doing that, cross the website, um, huge, like 10 times better than what you have. A hundred times better than you have just with some basic, like I&#8217;m talk I, when I did the Google search with the business card, I said, simple, modern business card. That&#8217;s your favicon, or you upload your own little image.  </p>



<p>You got, that&#8217;s your site title, that&#8217;s your site tagline. Maybe that&#8217;s edible. And then you add in your little information. I mean,&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> yeah. [00:50:00] Yeah. And, and the default, you know, is all of these sites will go and grab, you know, ideally there&#8217;s an OG image, and so you are creating one in Canva and reimporting it, um, or you, um, or it&#8217;s trying to grab the first image on the page.  </p>



<p>So usually that&#8217;s the featured image. It&#8217;s like, like we said, you know what, what kind of started this whole conversation a month ago now between you and I is the, like, better than a featured image put, put some bullet points on it, put the title, put the, you know, um, whatever, whatever, whatever other data points you can add so that when they share it, it&#8217;s not just an image.  </p>



<p>An abstract image. Oh, it&#8217;s a widget. It&#8217;s like, oh no, it&#8217;s a widget that has these benefits. Buy it on this website.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So an over graph question is, we we&#8217;re talking about generating the HTML snapshot and then making it, or [00:51:00] across the site, but we do have the h html sitting there too. Mm-hmm. I don&#8217;t know how Op grf does that, but, but for what looks like, it seems like it&#8217;s an image, but I mean, we still have the H M L code code rendered somewhere.  </p>



<p>Yep. Okay. So this right here. Oh, I just wanted to go down there to see. Okay. There&#8217;s something here. Basically the value prop is overnight flesh out in a more professional manner. Your open graph, social distributions, I mean, I&#8217;d go back to something like this if I don&#8217;t have a featured image, which I don&#8217;t on most of my blog posts, and, um, it&#8217;ll just pull a simple image that looks a little, it&#8217;s a treatment.  </p>



<p>Like we&#8217;ve been talking about the images. What are you truly trying to do is just show its image. [00:52:00] And if you set your defaults, like having, you know, you&#8217;re like, whatever, you&#8217;re, were yellow or were orange. So  </p>



<p>we probably don&#8217;t wanna do that, but, um Right. You know, right there. Mm-hmm. You just made something a little nicer.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. Or your, you know, logo. Logo in the top right. Or, um, you know, if there isn&#8217;t a featured or, you know, and so if there&#8217;s a featured image, it shows up. If there isn&#8217;t, you have at least got your logo.  </p>



<p>Um, you know, and or the option to, um, We could even have an option that says like, if you don&#8217;t have a featured image, just do a big old logo.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. Like, uh, you know, the ultimate guide to social images, you knows the headline,  </p>



<p>[00:53:00] you know, there&#8217;s that option and stuff like that. Anyway, I think there&#8217;s a lot here. All that to say Yep. That with the premise of open, we know it is open graph, but it&#8217;s probably not the marking side, but it&#8217;s like, um, instantly create a more professional open graph presence for your entire site.  </p>



<p>Something better, like these will be images too. And so like, so in that if programmatically we could say that. It&#8217;ll pull your featured image into these, you know, spots and we&#8217;re saving that image that automatically puts an image back into that post, right? Mm-hmm.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Oh yeah, we could do that. So use this as featured image gen generate better image replaced featured image.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I mean, it&#8217;s kinda like the 3D book cover. Those were just generated cuz it was all digital assets. So they wanted a visual way to [00:54:00] do that in the same sample, doing that&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> software too. Remember they start, they would show a box like you&#8217;d buy at Staples, but you couldn&#8217;t actually walk into Staples and buy it.  </p>



<p>Album covers T-shirts. Yeah. I mean there&#8217;s, and, and there&#8217;s good examples online. There&#8217;s lots of little apps now that, um, you can build, um, Build the screenshots or take, take a screenshot and it puts it in a browser and puts it at a tilt, like you said. Um, like we&#8217;d have to play with all that. But, um, put it in a browser wrapper, put it on an iPhone, have somebody smiling and holding it on their iPhone.  </p>



<p>You know, um, yeah. All those things. Like we can, again, once, once we&#8217;ve got the template builder, essentially then our imagination, as long as we can do it in H T M L, then we can create a template that does that and people can build their own too, which is what I really like. Cuz you&#8217;re, [00:55:00] you&#8217;re gonna have nerds like me who will look at, um, look at a couple of hours simple templates and go, oh, cool.  </p>



<p>Let me, let me go build my own specific to my website, my own branding, or, you know, I. Yeah, because, and then we created Marketplace and people could sell the templates and take, get a commission. We&#8217;ll go crazy baby.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. I was just trying to skip this out of, okay, the, this all seems valuable to people, uh, to me, and I think it would be, should be to other people.  </p>



<p>And then, like you said, it, well, I mean, one is creating an open graph image for each post. Um, sitewide in each post, what we have here. I didn&#8217;t, you know, there&#8217;s another benefit that we talked about. It&#8217;s like, well, like for my site would instantly get a bunch of thumbnails or, you know, the book [00:56:00] cover type treatment.  </p>



<p>Um, then you&#8217;ve just told the search engines, I&#8217;ve got new image content. Mm. You&#8217;ve, you&#8217;ve made an update to existing posts, you know? Yep. So, That&#8217;s my, maybe part three or something, but, or I don&#8217;t even know. But, um, I just see that value going. Oh. Cuz you can show, people are tired of seeing, you know, crap.  </p>



<p>You know, you&#8217;re doing all this content work, but you&#8217;re tired of seeing the social distribution, open graph stuff look like crap. This solves that problem with a click. Yep. So that&#8217;s why I wanted to go down this of like, where, I mean, this right here, there&#8217;s a pot of gold here. I mean, if you don&#8217;t, if you have great content in the past, but you don&#8217;t really have a lot of the strong image stuff, then use, use these two.  </p>



<p>Yep. You know, like the table of contents [00:57:00] plug in. Mm-hmm. It&#8217;ll auto generate something and then, you know, you click, click that&#8217;s made, it&#8217;ll pull it and then you go, yeah, sa saved whatever it is. And then now you&#8217;ve added an image. Image search is what we talked about last time. Image search to a blog post with a little bit of, with some automation here.  </p>



<p>That&#8217;s really cool. Um, yeah.  </p>



<p>With, you know, not a, doesn&#8217;t seem like a ton of work for the user side. Um, maybe there&#8217;s a, you know, an option here per post, which is use the excerpt, use the first block quote, find the H two s, the list or something, you know what I mean? Mm-hmm. And then you just, cuz I was trying to think from em, image&#8217;s, search for a [00:58:00] second, you go, um, that&#8217;s another way to get search engine traffic and visibility for your brand.  </p>



<p>I mean, summarize it. Look, this is, we had this conversation a couple weeks ago. Summarize your content with this kind of  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. The tldr. Yeah.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So for the template engine, I wanted to get all this cuz it&#8217;s like, well these are all the ingredients that we could potentially want. So that, you know, when you start building it, like, okay, I need to, maybe for an image you can,  </p>



<p>uh, you know, pull, pull H two s, you know. Mm-hmm. Pull the first block, quote and that auto populates in here.  </p>



<p>Okay. Thank you for going all the way down there. Now back to this. Does this give some more fleshed out detail to the [00:59:00] template workflow? The. Workflow conversation.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;m trying to think of where to start. Um, I think that the workflow that I&#8217;m working on still, still works. I think we start with posts, um, and then we can implement like the sitewide version using whatever we&#8217;ve defined.  </p>



<p>Cuz it&#8217;s like, to me, the post paradigm is ex the example that we will then implement everywhere. Um, so we can basically take whatever little builder I design and stick it back in the welcome. So it&#8217;s like, you know, okay, connect to your, connect your account, let&#8217;s create your site business card. Do you wanna then use this for all all posts?  </p>



<p>Do you wanna then. You know, generate, [01:00:00] generate business cards for each post retroactively. And then do you wanna get into social images? This is kind of cool cuz it&#8217;s like, we&#8217;re not even, in my mind it was, it was about social. Um, like I said, I&#8217;d even, you know, the sort of code name for this project for me was social images.  </p>



<p>It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m writing a post and then I&#8217;m generating an image for Twitter or Facebook, et cetera. But we&#8217;re now talking about like, there&#8217;s so much other value before we even get to social. Technically. I mean, it&#8217;s all technically social cuz it&#8217;s about if you&#8217;re sharing a post, um, than it, than it pulls in the, the featured image or what the OG image.  </p>



<p>But, um, that&#8217;s all, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s great cuz it&#8217;s all, you&#8217;re covering your bases of incoming traffic and then you can go do your outbound marketing.  </p>



<p>The shields are up and then you fire the torpedoes. Yeah.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> It seems [01:01:00] like, okay. Start with the sidewalk, like you said. And there&#8217;s an option just to make that at the beginning, to make that if no social link or something is there, use this option, then you&#8217;ve professionalized your site. Um, then you could do the per post  </p>



<p>Yeah. Option.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> And then give us all your money if you want to go to do the past ones and or the Woo commerce add-on and or. A hundred other things. We haven&#8217;t, you know, the, the marketing kit generator. So it automatically spits out Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, you know, one click generate, one click download, upload it to buffer, you know, buffer integration, um, or whatever, whatever you use to, [01:02:00] to schedule your social posts.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, all those are even before getting to the post, you could say like this, just generate it through everything on the site. So there is an open graph. Mm-hmm. Image. Then when you want to tweak per post product page, whatever that is, there&#8217;s maybe in post tweaking options where we can say, update from generic, there&#8217;s a fallback to the site wide, and then as you want, you come in here and then we could look at which ones we do.  </p>



<p>We do first.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yep. But I like the idea of a sensible default. I was like, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m picturing again, like one of my sites, client sites is a magazine that&#8217;s been online for 12 years. So m half the half the posts, um, um, so many of the posts have images, random sizes and things like that. [01:03:00] Um, but they&#8217;ve all at least got a title and an image and a publish date.  </p>



<p>Some of that&#8217;s not true, but you know, like you could say, okay, so if somebody for whatever reason, shares a post from 10 years ago, it still looks basically good. Better than it, than, than it looks now where it&#8217;s just a random featured image.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> See, I mean, Okay, so in that you go, here&#8217;s this one for just the site. And then when you go to post, you&#8217;re like, maybe it&#8217;s some treatment like this. Like if there&#8217;s a featured image, don&#8217;t do the generic pull in featured image. Yep. And God, I gotta believe Corey, that the premise is if you can just make your site look professional with a click, and I think that [01:04:00] this, this right here would be the way to start.  </p>



<p>Yeah. Like a default, A default image with an option to apply to.  </p>



<p>And then, you know, if there&#8217;s a featured image in that post, go ahead and create a thumb, you know, a featured image thing. God. Right. So with that, my hypothesis would be  </p>



<p>start here with, and if we can get the applied to all posts that&#8217;s worth a hundred dollars, like instantly, think about how long you&#8217;d have to go to update every post. But in one click you could essentially set a very nice, we&#8217;d have to land the design, you know, just a really nice modern looking design, but like in one click that&#8217;s not worth a hundred dollars, update your open graph.  </p>



<p>Right. [01:05:00] With, and even here, we&#8217;ve said if, if, if a post, if post has featured image, you know, use it with X template. Mm-hmm. If you got that out, like for, for right now, my, my value pro for Post Status would be Yeah. You know? Right. Yeah. Um, then if we wanted to going forward, we could, we could look at for Post Status as a client.  </p>



<p>Okay. Now, ongoing, um, when V2 hits, you know, select an image right there in the post block quote,&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> uh, freeform. Yeah. I&#8217;m picturing, um, a screen. It&#8217;s like if we, if we can, you know, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re totally blue, blue skying here. It&#8217;s like, but it&#8217;s, you know, generate image. I wanna generate a bunch of images. [01:06:00] A screen opens up that says, um, looks like it has a featured image.  </p>



<p>Looks like it has a couple of images in line, so check, check, check. So that&#8217;s three. Looks like it has block quotes, you know, two block quotes. Do you want to use them? I&#8217;ll you say this one and not this one, you know? And so it&#8217;s like, now generate, and that&#8217;s fi you know, it just spits out five, five different images and you go, oh yeah, I like this one and this one, you know, that they, it, it fits together well.  </p>



<p>Um, you know, but I think we can,  </p>



<p>with some degree of reliability, we can, we can, we can at least try to pull stuff out. Like we featured Image for sure. Title for sure. Excerpt for sure. Um, I like your idea of, of essentially looking at H two s, um, creating an outline. And so, you know, they could just say, yep, that outline works, that&#8217;s accurate or it&#8217;s not.  </p>



<p>Um, block quotes are easy cuz they&#8217;re surrounded by, if they&#8217;re done right, they&#8217;re H T M L, you know, [01:07:00] it&#8217;s an actual block quote tag. Um, and so they can, they can basically just, you know, we say, here&#8217;s your template. And then here&#8217;s all the elements from the page that we&#8217;ve detected, and you can add your own too, you know, now click a button to sort of put them together.  </p>



<p>Man, I really,&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I really like this. I feel, I feel, when we talked about crop express, it was a thing, a utility thing. We thought we needed. We know we needed, and we think hypothesis. Everybody probably needs this mostly, and thi but that was a very tiny detail in a process, right? We just got in a workflow process.  </p>



<p>We just got to a whole site value prop. Um, like just, just right here, [01:08:00] right now, my question would be, do we, do you. We&#8217;re doing this from a SaaS that you&#8217;ve already built in the, in the back. Like it has to take the information, send it over, snapshot it, send it back, right. It&#8217;s almost a blend. Like the plugin in some sense might be some of the design stuff, but it&#8217;s a plugin with a SaaS component to it.  </p>



<p>Right. Um, I don&#8217;t know if that makes it easier, harder, whatever,&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> but, right. Well, I mean my, yeah, my, the way I&#8217;d set this stuff up originally was I was like, you know, there&#8217;s an API over there that obviously your average person doesn&#8217;t know about, but you can put any product you want in front of it. And like, I&#8217;m basically just running like a water company, electric company utility.  </p>



<p>Like, I don&#8217;t care if you&#8217;re running a blender or an air conditioner, I&#8217;m just selling you electricity. [01:09:00] So my intention originally was, To just, I, you know, here&#8217;s this thing, it generates screenshots and then build all these little apps in front of it, or you can build your own. Um, and I just charge for screen, you know, per screenshot.  </p>



<p>Um,  </p>



<p>trying to think of, I mean, so it&#8217;s like you look at, um, awesome motives. Optin Monster comes to mind. You know, they are a SaaS that technically works without the WordPress plugin, but it&#8217;s really 99% designed to run with the WordPress plugin, um, for WordPress. And so you pay for a number of impressions or a number of campaigns or, I don&#8217;t remember what, what it is, but it&#8217;s something like that.  </p>



<p>So I think we would definitely want to. We&#8217;ll have to think about that, right? Because it&#8217;s like the number of, if we [01:10:00] go with my model, it&#8217;s very abstracted. Um, you know, it&#8217;s per image generated, but you don&#8217;t want somebody to sit there and go, oh, well, if I generate one more picture, you know, or if I tweak it and then regenerate and tweak it and regenerate, like, Ooh, did I spend it an eighth of a penny?  </p>



<p>Like, you don&#8217;t want people worrying about that. So, um, you know, some, some general, but I, again, I, I control the, the water supply. Um, so we can do it in a way that. You know, you get, you get a thousand images or it&#8217;s per post or per channels, or like, we can do something that makes a lot more sense for the end user or makes sense to the end user without being as technical as, you know, per image generated May, and maybe that is what we want.  </p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know, but we can, we can kind of do what we want. Um, the, the downside is, I don&#8217;t have a lot of information yet [01:11:00] about how much it actually costs, um, per, because I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve generated images for myself in a small quantity, you know, but at scale, I don&#8217;t know yet.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, could we, could we, and I think we should use Post Status, uh, for sure.  </p>



<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s wide open. There&#8217;s no worries there. And I can, I&#8217;ll give you a discount Post Status can pay for that, but I go, I. I want this on Post Status. Um, right. Then we go like, look what we did, we just overnight with one click essentially, um, created here, here&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t know from the technical side.  </p>



<p>So like if we said just you create in there one time the open graph image. Okay. Go back for the entire site, it comes back. This is the default. That&#8217;s one image. Right? Right now I don&#8217;t know what the option for like [01:12:00] just that default business card image here. That&#8217;s one image. Yep. The setting could be, um, you know, apply this one image across site.  </p>



<p>I. I mean, that&#8217;s just saying programmatically in WordPress, that one image in your image library right now attaches No, the default open group across the database. Am I on track there?&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Correct. Because yeah, if we do it, um, so that the image comes back and you are hosting it, what do we care? So it, it, we have to pay for a few CPU cycles.  </p>



<p>That&#8217;s it.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So there&#8217;s that without getting pricing or whatever, but I just go that, yeah, I would, I want that today from post tennis. I want. Okay. Yeah. [01:13:00] Then we, we could say, we could use Post Status with, I don&#8217;t know, thousands of articles, but, um, okay. Take most of these, a lot of these posts probably have a featured image in it on our site.  </p>



<p>Yep. And then run that. I would pay the bill post us would pay the bill for that. Now create and just see what kind of thing we&#8217;re looking sure at. You&#8217;ve got a third here. I added though, is like, it&#8217;s one thing to do the feature, just an open graph image, but that&#8217;s not saying crop it for Twitter, Facebook.  </p>



<p>So each post can have five different images. Right.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> And that&#8217;s, and that&#8217;s where it, it gets, I think it, it, it may get tricky for the end user to understand cuz also they&#8217;re like, okay, I&#8217;ve generated images. If I share my page, I see one of those images. But where it lives [01:14:00] somewhere in the media library. But you&#8217;re also showing me these, these other thumbnails.  </p>



<p>One&#8217;s a square that says Instagram under it, but it&#8217;s not on Instagram. Like, what, what do I do with this? You know? And so like, what, that might be a little tricky. Um, that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re talking about, but that&#8217;s, but to me that&#8217;s, you know, that&#8217;s the bigger product that we&#8217;re talking about is like, I, I kind of like the phrase of like media kit generator, where it&#8217;s like for each post create five different images and they, and download them as a zip.  </p>



<p>And so you get a zip file that, um, you know, or I mean, we can have a page click here to open your media kit for this post and you see all those images and there&#8217;s a download button or again, a share out button or what have you. Um, but yeah, each, each post, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the thing right? Is um, As it&#8217;s exponential.  </p>



<p>So it&#8217;s per post, or it&#8217;s, or it&#8217;s each [01:15:00] post. And then however many you want per post. And if, and if each post you wanna have, and this is, this is probably not a retroactive thing, um, but it&#8217;s like I write a post today. I want Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. I want three different versions. Say they&#8217;re three block quotes.  </p>



<p>So Facebook times three, Twitter times three, Instagram times three, you know, same, same treatment, but block quote, block quote, block quote. And so I&#8217;m like, okay, because I wanna schedule this to go to tweet today, tomorrow, and the next day. Like that&#8217;s a proper marketing campaign around a post, a new post.  </p>



<p>But that&#8217;s nine social images. Plus open graph. So that&#8217;s 10 per post. And that&#8217;s where it starts to get exponential, you know? Um, not a bad thing. I mean, and these aren&#8217;t expensive cuz [01:16:00] we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re using, you know, cloud computing as you&#8217;d expect. But that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s, it might get complicated. Like we need to think about like per channel or per variation, or maybe it just is per image generated per post, or maybe it&#8217;s just per, it is per, you know, it&#8217;s like okay, every, every post is, you know, uh, 10 cents and you get 10 images per post.  </p>



<p>Cuz I, I, I can&#8217;t imagine that we&#8217;re paying a penny per image at the end of the day. Especially if we push it all back to their media library. We&#8217;re not hosting it, so it doesn&#8217;t, it shouldn&#8217;t cost us anything to ho you know, to ongoing disk space. At some point, we&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll delete old images that aren&#8217;t getting used or something, but, you know, we say, But how, how you bill for 10 cents.  </p>



<p>Cuz also there&#8217;s this, like, one of the things that I wanted to do when I created Screenshot Express initially, I just, I like the [01:17:00] idea, you know, as we&#8217;ve talked about in, um, previous sessions, we don&#8217;t, we don&#8217;t need this. And so we don&#8217;t need, you know, this is, this is fun for us, this is a pursuit for us, but it&#8217;s not, you know, do or die.  </p>



<p>And so it&#8217;s like, I want to, I want to take every opportunity to like play with conventions. And so part of the thing that, you know, always bugs me about various services, there&#8217;s is there&#8217;s Ford developers, there&#8217;s the pay per cycle, pay per whatever. Um, And then there&#8217;s the other ones that are like, you pay a hundred dollars and you get a hundred things, and if you then need 101, we mark, we bump you up to the next payment tier.  </p>



<p>Um, and that bothers me because it&#8217;s like, well, I, what if I only use 80, then I just gave you money, or the price per thing went up. Um, but the inverse, especially for a lot of non-technical people or in a lot of non-business [01:18:00] thinking people is like, gulp, I don&#8217;t want to pay a dollar per thing because what if somebody hacks my site and uses us out a thousand things that just cost me a thousand dollars.  </p>



<p>Um, and so somewhere in the middle is this like, you know, pay for blocks or, um, you know, like there&#8217;s some friendly way to Yeah. Um, have variable pricing without it, with, you know, with sanity checks or something like that. So I. And I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m way overthinking it. The truth is, is we&#8217;re gonna end up just charging $99, you know, for a thousand images per, per month.  </p>



<p>And, and we can, we can kind of gauge that when we set it up, we&#8217;re like, oh, it looks like you have a thousand blog posts, and so we&#8217;re gonna put you in the thousand dollars tier or whatever, you know, whatever. It&#8217;s,&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> um, so it, it, it, it occurs to me for a second just to tuck this through because [01:19:00] No, that&#8217;s, you&#8217;re not overthinking that.  </p>



<p>I think you&#8217;re making sure if you play this out, what that looks like and there&#8217;s some decisions to be made, which are good. I think so. But like, okay. There&#8217;s functionality probably, like I can go to Canva and create an open one, default open graph image. Now applying that across my site is functionality.  </p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if it exists. Or if it does, right?&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Like you&#8217;d need something like, you&#8217;d need something like Yost, but you are, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re plugging in one image. Yeah. Maybe technically two. I think they give you Facebook and Twitter,  </p>



<p>but that&#8217;s definitely, that&#8217;s the easy free onboarding for sure. Yeah. And then I, I honestly think that we, we build this, we run it against Post Status. We run it against my client&#8217;s site. We look at the bills, and two things are gonna [01:20:00] happen. One, we&#8217;re gonna know what our costs are, and two, we will have the experience of using it and go, oh, if, if I didn&#8217;t know better, I would expect to pay for this, this way.  </p>



<p>And just, you know, and ju it&#8217;ll just be like, oh, right, it should be 20 bucks. Month, build monthly.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Now, as I, as I thought about that, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ll have to go back to Yos, but I go the ability to take any image I have, whether OMG does this or not, but apply it across the site. And it&#8217;s probably not one, it&#8217;s three.  </p>



<p>Like we&#8217;re talking about, it&#8217;s Google showing up, it&#8217;s Facebook, Twitter, you know, so there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s four images to say or something. Now two and I, huh?  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> There really is only two cuz every, I&#8217;m I, as far as I know, everybody [01:21:00] uses open graph image. Twitter&#8217;s the only one that&#8217;s broken away. Uh oh. Like I just Googled, you know, uh, LinkedIn open graph.  </p>



<p>And the article that comes up says, make your website shareable on LinkedIn. And it says below are the OG tags. And it&#8217;s just, Facebook&#8217;s OG tags. So LinkedIn just uses, use it, not just, but LinkedIn uses the same as Facebook.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. Then let me, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking. This could just, this functionality No, no.  </p>



<p>Create an image, but just a plug in type functionality of see this image, apply it, cross the site to blogs, to everything on my site so that it&#8217;s my reference sensation of my site. If it doesn&#8217;t have other, other things that feels like that could be a [01:22:00] free, free option. A hundred percent. And that&#8217;s valuable to, um, just going, yeah, I went to Camba, I got all my outputs, I wanna put &#8217;em in and I just wanna say, apply that to my site so that instantly everything looks better if it&#8217;s generic.  </p>



<p>Okay. But that&#8217;s like probably a free option for us. Now where I go value though, is right here of I value all of my posts. Not having the generic, but having a minimal treatment. Generat an image for that post that has, if it has a featured image, put a featured image over here. Right. Something like that.  </p>



<p>See, that&#8217;s interesting to me. I think that&#8217;s what we should play with and figure out that. Mm-hmm. Because I go, I want that today and if it costs me $500, I&#8217;d do it. Hmm. If, if basic like, think about doing that [01:23:00] from cama, it&#8217;s gonna take you a month. Oh yeah. Uploading, creating images, downloading and all this stuff.  </p>



<p>But that&#8217;s worth easily $500 for me today of any post on the site has this kind of image treatment with a click. And it&#8217;s in the appropriate image graph now. Just told Google and my media library is under these pages or new images. I&#8217;ve just updated my content.  </p>



<p>Yep. Like now I&#8217;m kind of thinking Corey, like that&#8217;s some version of, this is actually B one that&#8217;s free, but, but this could be, you know, a small, I&#8217;m guessing small free plugin. Upload your image. It&#8217;s applied generically through your site with some real simple, you know, business card template, but this, or use cam [01:24:00] and just put it up there.  </p>



<p>This is powerful to me because I go every,&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> it&#8217;s a huge time saver. That&#8217;s the, yeah. Time and money, right is, yeah. Like you said, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re, if you&#8217;re auto generating, And especially if you&#8217;re auto generating in bulk. Yeah. Okay, let&#8217;s sign off. I&#8217;ll go build it. Okay. I&#8217;ll have it to you in 15 minutes. Just kidding.  </p>



<p>Do you have an auto generate button for that? Yeah, it&#8217;s called chat. G p t.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Uh, yeah. Hey, that&#8217;s valuable. Um, what do I need to be thinking about for that? Because I&#8217;m trying to put, I have the post that it&#8217;s head on, but like, okay. What would I want is to be able to go through auto generate headline, an expert excerpt.  </p>



<p>If it has a featured image, put it on there [01:25:00] for each post and be at in my media library attached to my post.  </p>



<p>I mean, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a lot of value. Am I missing something here? Like I go mm-hmm. Something with a button click. You could pretty much create new images packaged, um, in a way. And then telling Google in the net social networks, this now exists for this piece of content.  </p>



<p>I&#8217;m having a hard time saying, why wouldn&#8217;t I want that right now? Like I&#8217;ve right for some money, I&#8217;ve instantly updated and created new content for every post on my site.  </p>



<p>And there&#8217;s. I know themes used the featured image, but we, we&#8217;d wanna be careful replacing the featured image. But you go like, a lot of the themes have those, well, like the Frames blog have those little, well, you know, [01:26:00] a lot of sites don&#8217;t even have that.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> The hero. Yep.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> The hero, the thumbnail, whatever that is.  </p>



<p>Where it&#8217;s like in the category archive, you&#8217;ve instantly shown a nice basic modern design treatment with your colors and for everything.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yep. Yeah. And it, I mean, and, and we&#8217;d have a button that says, um, you know, swap for featured image. Like we&#8217;ve taken your featured image, we&#8217;ve put some text over it, you know, if you like this, make your featured image better.  </p>



<p>So then it just one in, one out. We&#8217;re not gonna delete your featured image cuz you could regenerate, want to regenerate the image again or something. But it would, yeah, like, so we&#8217;ll give you that option. Like you probably don&#8217;t want to do it by default. Um, but, so yeah, I, for now, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s wrap up for today.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. Yeah. Sorry, I, we went over.  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> No, it&#8217;s fine. [01:27:00] Um, you saw my note. I put a couple of things in Slack.  </p>



<p>Sorry, I was in Never Neverland. I like it when you&#8217;re in Never Neverland.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yes. We should get that. Um,&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> cool. Um, but I think, yeah, I think at this point, like I&#8217;m pretty close to something that does something and, and let&#8217;s have that something, that Alpha version run against. I mean, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s get, create a Post Status staging or something.  </p>



<p>Um, but see what it, you know, Let&#8217;s watch it run because there&#8217;s other technical things. I wanna see, like we said, pricing. I wanna see how long it takes, you know, stuff like that. So let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s get into, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s solve the problem for one and for 10 and for a hundred. And then, [01:28:00] you know, start to, and we&#8217;ll continue to talk about the actual product and we&#8217;ll just, and, you know, we&#8217;re designing a really nice engine.  </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s, we&#8217;ll also talk about what the car looks like and then we can drop the engine in the car.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So there&#8217;s 6,800 posts in, in Post says blog post only. Okay.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> That would be perfect. That&#8217;s a great number.  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> That would be  </p>



<p>okay. Okay, I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll be thinking about what the card I wanted to look like, but I think it&#8217;s title featured image, the standard branding.&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Um, and yeah, and like I said, I mean, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re, I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve already, I have, I couldn&#8217;t show you, but I have two, you know, two very basic templates started. They are so easy to create.  </p>



<p>We can, we can create 10, you know, in an hour. Just going, [01:29:00] oh, put this here, here, here. Cool. That&#8217;s one. Put this here, here, here. Background image two, you know, cuz I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve, for better or worse, like, I went down the rabbit hole of abstracting a lot of this stuff out. So we can just say, I want a color, you know, I want background color, I want text color, I want, so it&#8217;s just color, color, color, color.  </p>



<p>Font, font, font, font, on and on. So, We can, we can even sit down, like once we have one basic thing that we know is running, working, then you and I could, you know, have one of these calls where we just knock together 10 different templates. Okay?&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. Thanks man. I lost track of time. Thanks for going&nbsp;  </p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> over. No, it&#8217;s fine.  </p>



<p>Um, but yeah, so stay on for a minute. Okay. Session 11. End.</p>

<p>In this episode, <a href="https://twitter.com/corymiller303">Cory Miller</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/coreymaass">Corey Maass</a> discuss the future of WordPress. From the adoption of the block editor to the rise of headless WordPress, they consider the impact on the growing WordPress community.

This is an honest and hopeful look at the current and future state of WordPress.</p>



<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Keep up with the latest WordPress updates.</strong> It&#8217;s important for WordPress professionals to stay up-to-date with the latest WordPress updates, including security patches, bug fixes, and new features.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Session 10 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>



<p>Cory Miller: [00:00:00] Nice. Um, so it makes it really nice to stream YouTube. Um, okay, so<br>session 10. Now turn off YouTube. Um, so session 10, we&#8217;re talking, um, last week we said<br>we&#8217;re good on the version for Crop Dotted Express, and we had saw a new direction with the<br>project you had been working on anyway. Mm-hmm. And we spent some time just privately<br>discussing that.<br>And so, um, we were just chatting in the pre-roll before this about okay is, you know, building it<br>in public, but we&#8217;re, we&#8217;ve pa not paused, we&#8217;ve put a bow on that one and said, okay, there&#8217;s<br>something else here. And now it&#8217;s time to kind of explore that and figure out what&#8217;s, what could<br>that product be. [00:01:00] Um, you just had a couple really good, um, comments about that<br>whole process of here&#8217;s that one, but we&#8217;re going onto this next one.<br>Hmm. Can you share some of that you&#8217;re just sharing with me? Cause I think it&#8217;s really good<br>and I don&#8217;t want to Sure. Oh, your butcher, you&#8217;re your top.<br>Corey Maass: Um, so, uh, for the sake of accountability, I do wanna say that Crop express, uh,<br>is pending a read me update that you and I worked on, I think last time. And there are a couple<br>of tweaks to make to the product itself.<br>The plugin itself. To in fact put a bow on it cuz I wanted it. It&#8217;s gonna be, you know, so, so a little<br>digression here. It&#8217;s very easy for, uh, any product team as we now are to go, uh, that was<br>yesterday&#8217;s new shiny, [00:02:00] today&#8217;s new shinies over there. Um, and if we are not<br>abandoning crop express, which we are not, then it&#8217;s important that I sit down at some point and<br>actually put a bow on it.<br>And we don&#8217;t just keep saying we&#8217;re gonna put a bow on it and let it ride, but, um, you know, let<br>it be a whole product unto itself. I think that&#8217;s important. So that&#8217;s on my list. Um, but yeah, we,<br>in, in the process of talking about crop express and where the value add is, um, one of the<br>things that you talked about really well, um, is the, Difference between, you had a little graphic<br>that, you know, pain solving a pain versus adding value.<br>Um, and obviously these things are not mutually exclusive by any stretch, but, um, crop Express<br>solved a problem for us. That&#8217;s why, why we started the conversation in the first place. I built this<br>little web utility. You went, holy crap, this [00:03:00] needs to be in WordPress. Uh, and that<br>launched our journey, but we kept having these great meta conversations about image images<br>in WordPress as a whole.<br>And one of the things, problems that I&#8217;ve been struggling with for a while, for my own blog and<br>again for, um, client sites, not only is it cropping images correctly, which solves a pain point,<br>ideally, um, but is you write a blog post and, and then what? Right. You need other assets to go<br>along with it. Uh, and then in a perfect, you know, so we&#8217;re talking, now we&#8217;re talking about<br>marketing, right?<br>We&#8217;re talking about marketing assets, things to put on Twitter, images to put on Twitter images<br>to put on Instagram, and, and having to go over to Canva to do that or some other tool. Um, and<br>so now we&#8217;re talking [00:04:00] about that, which is, you know, there is pain involved. These are<br>extra steps, but it&#8217;s the difference between, to me, you know, the difference between trying to<br>write a, a basic blog post with an image inward press, and that it&#8217;s.<br>You get to the end of the words and you&#8217;re like, oh, this is such a pain. I need to do something<br>with an image and leave WordPress. Versus traditionally, I think we&#8217;d write a blog post in<br>WordPress and then go, okay, the WordPress part is done. Now let me jump over to Canva,<br>Photoshop, whatever it is to generate these other images.<br>Um, and so now we&#8217;re sort of switching over to a value add potentially.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah. I, um, most of my product experience is in the pain threshold. Um, you know,<br>backup, security, all that, you know, updating stuff, very [00:05:00] utilitarian, um, practical<br>things, and I really appreciate it. That&#8217;s part of my personality too. I like utility things. You know,<br>there&#8217;s this pin, for instance, is the big. A pin.<br>And in my belief, there&#8217;s no other better pin than this pin. So I take &#8217;em from everywhere that<br>has &#8217;em, that gives &#8217;em out. And I promote all Napa Valley Winery. Um, so I, I&#8217;m practical in that</p>



<p>utilitarian, like, do something for you. And it was great to see some of the products, like people<br>just, they needed it, you know?<br>Um, I always aspired to the ones that help people look good, make money, all that. And we built<br>those into those products for sure, where people could use those things and what labeled them<br>or package them into a bigger thing. And so a lot of the products were very utility products, but<br>the marketing and things we did was very aspirational.<br>Um, [00:06:00] this one so interesting because you had already been working on something and<br>you showed it to me and I was like, oh, wow. And. As I can do anything, I can blow something<br>real big up, you know? And that&#8217;s what we did. We, wow. The compelling thing was, you know,<br>I&#8217;ll take some of the marketing tools, like for instance, uh, the one I just kind of default to think of<br>is Optum Monster.<br>Hmm. When you see what, whatever time they came out with the Optum Monster, um, when<br>you see that a popup and what they, what you could do with that, you instantly kind of go, oh<br>wow, I could do that too. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s really compelling for me. Um mm-hmm. When you&#8217;re<br>able to show an outcome that people go, I mean, it&#8217;s marketing product for sure.<br>It helps you build your email, um, email list. It helps you potentially, [00:07:00] uh, get some<br>purchases from coupons and things like that. Not to go into the full thing about Optum Monster,<br>but. You go right there, you can see what the product does. Mm-hmm. And if you don&#8217;t have<br>that, you can go, wow, this could make, make it easier.<br>What&#8217;s compelling about what you said was, or what we, we, you showed me is this, one of the<br>many things we talked about was the social images, being able to, you write your post and then<br>you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re ready to promote it and like you said, go to Cam and do all these things. Um, I<br>think in this conversation, what I&#8217;ve kinda learned from Crop Drive Express and then past stuff is<br>particularly with this idea, we can give that aha oh wow moment for someone.<br>And we talked about using it on some of our client sites, post status and different things. Um,<br>because then when you see. That&#8217;s where I [00:08:00] think, you know, when they see<br>something going out that has a nice treatment, um, yeah. Where it&#8217;s not just a link. I mean,<br>that&#8217;s what I tend to do personally. Um, then I think there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s some merit there of you want<br>your base hub to be your website and they&#8217;re promoting outs through your social channels, and<br>then those to look appealing and good, whether it&#8217;s Facebook, Instagram, whatever those things<br>are.<br>Yeah. Um, and kinda lead back. And that&#8217;s where I go. I&#8217;ll tell you, I in this, in this whole project<br>that we&#8217;ve been working on together, it just keep, I keep coming back to you and I talked about<br>our, at our product owners meet up this week. Um, getting as close as you can to the pain that a<br>potential customer has, um, or that desire to do for them to look better, make more money.</p>



<p>Um, I don&#8217;t know. This is the work I need to do more is getting closer to that, you know? Mm-<br>hmm. Where it&#8217;s not just theory, us talking, it&#8217;s like, [00:09:00] you know, do, is this an issue?</p>



<p>And there&#8217;s, um, you know, a book out called the Mom Test and mm-hmm. The thing is, when<br>you have an idea and you go to your mom, she&#8217;s always gonna say, I love it.<br>Yeah. So making it in a way where it&#8217;s more discovery. But that&#8217;s my thoughts about this and I<br>wanna be sure because this is a bigger project. Um, I guess the word would be validating. Yep.<br>Is there a pain point? Is there someone willing to, to, to pay for it? Um, so we&#8217;re really taking it. I<br>know we approached this as a hobby, but going, okay, give our best effort to make this into<br>something that actually does pay us my thought.<br>Corey Maass: Yeah. . And that was, and that was, I think, part of why, so I don&#8217;t remember the<br>summary to, to, we&#8217;re on session 10. So in session eight, I think we, we, the conversation came<br>to a point where we said, okay, so, so [00:10:00] cropping images is one piece of the puzzle of<br>consistent, good looking images on a WordPress site.<br>That could be a blog, that could be WooCommerce, whatever, right? Um, and so we were still<br>sort of solving, um, yeah, we were solving a basic problem. Um, again, a p a a point of pain that,<br>uh, we had. Um, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m trying, in my brain, I keep drawing this analogy of, um, a basic car, your<br>Honda Civic from, I, my first Honda Civic, uh, that I bought in 2015 was from 2000.<br>So 15 year old, you know, but in good shape. But it would get you there, but no bells and<br>whistles. The, the crank windows, the whole thing, right? And so, um, and, and a lot of people, I<br>think this was a, you know, more traditionally [00:11:00] WordPress as a blog platform was that<br>for a lot of people, I&#8217;m gonna put words out.</p>



<p>Maybe people find it or they don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m gonna tell my friends about it along come social media,<br>uh, and, and other paradigms and, and the things go from, I guess you sort of hope for inbound,<br>you know, and we&#8217;re talking about amateurs or, or non-professionals is the better word, right?<br>But, um, you know, to outbound.<br>And then also I think there&#8217;s an expectation now, or most people blog for money, right? Most<br>people publish for money. Most people use WordPress for money a lot more than back in the<br>day when it was, you know, express yourself or put yourself online or, or, you know, build<br>authority, all those things. Um, and so taking that, uh, your, the, the bigger problem that we,<br>when we talked about with crop express of consistent [00:12:00] images and putting yourself out<br>there, and it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re talking about, um, Individuality, right?<br>So it&#8217;s not just cropping finding a, finding a, a stock photo one for each post, right? Or each, um,<br>product image. If you&#8217;ve, if you&#8217;re running Woo commerce, it&#8217;s like, yeah, it&#8217;s a square. Okay, it&#8217;s,<br>I sell, you know, this widget and that widget, and I crop them all to be squares. But it&#8217;s like, do<br>those images stand out?<br>Do those images have more information? So it&#8217;s like, if I go to the website, there&#8217;s all the<br>information next to a photo. But on Twitter, if I put that photo up and it&#8217;s just a picture of a<br>widget, it doesn&#8217;t list the benefits. It doesn&#8217;t, you know, so it&#8217;s not, um, a compelling bigger, and<br>this is where, you know, um, I think one of the things that really clicked for me was you sent me.<br>The, on the, on the post status blog, one of the threads there is, or tags or something is, you<br>know, here are all the [00:13:00] people we&#8217;ve featured. And I was like, wait, all of these banner<br>images not only are the same size, but they&#8217;ve all got the same treatment. They all have the<br>post status logo on the left. Um, you know, and we look at, and that, and that, that solidified<br>something for me that you&#8217;d touched on, but I, I couldn&#8217;t relate to as much.<br>Like, you, you really liked slides, um, and talked about using slides again to promote things.<br>And, and we sort of went, wow, what if, you know, you have, um, uh, your product images, you<br>or your, your, your blog post banner, image featured image, um, that had bullet points on it or,<br>you know, so it was like taking these, I guess what I&#8217;m trying to do is summarize, um, very<br>specifically, A little bit of how we got here, but also what we&#8217;re now talking about, right?<br>So we&#8217;re talking about image treatment, image generation, um, based around one post quote<br>unquote [00:14:00] post, which in WordPress can be a product, can be a blog post, can be an<br>article, can be your course if you&#8217;re running an l m s, whatever it is. Um, and so that&#8217;s kind of<br>the, the switch from solving a pain point, cropping an image to this huge value add.<br>And it&#8217;s like, and I guess, yeah, uh, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s coming together in my head. You brought in opt,<br>brought up Optum Monster. So it&#8217;s like you could have a website, you could have great content.<br>Optin Monster is this value add. If your end goal is promotion, money, fame, and fortune, all that<br>kind of stuff, being a reality TV star, um, optin Monster is this great.<br>You know, the going from, from your Honda Civic to the, the sport version, and then the fins and<br>the, you know, so now suddenly you&#8217;ve got, you know, you&#8217;ve gone from a basic way to publish<br>content to, you know, bells and [00:15:00] whistles essentially. Um, which isn&#8217;t to diminish it like<br>bells and whistles are often it&#8217;s, um, not it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s said in a condescending way or a bad way, but<br>we&#8217;re talking about like, okay, how can you, you know, make the, the basic car that gets you<br>from A to B be a fun experience, that kind of thing.<br>Um, enough restraining the metaphors. The point is, um, yeah, OptinMonster adds this extra<br>value and whatnot. So it&#8217;s like if we have, uh, if you write a blog post, what we&#8217;re talking about<br>doing is, is. A product in WordPress that can generate slides, can generate images, could crop<br>the image, but also could add potentially a, a graphical treatment.<br>Um, so it&#8217;s always got a blue fade or it&#8217;s always got a logo on the left, or it&#8217;s always got, and, and<br>these things would be auto-generated. Um, so you, you finish your post, you click a button and<br>[00:16:00] you&#8217;ve got an image for Twitter, an image for Facebook, an image that you know, I<br>mean, taking this to a, um, an extreme no idea if we can yet, if we can do this, but, um, anim an<br>creating an animated gift that has three slides that go by or, you know, things, so things you<br>could upload to Instagram.<br>You know, if it&#8217;s an animated gif it should be, we could create an MP4 out of it and then it&#8217;s, um,<br>a story for Instagram cuz it&#8217;s a video and da da da. So all these, all these shareable assets,<br>which again, take that basic blog post and just blow it up to, to create all these amazing things<br>that you could then do something with.</p>



<p>Um, when we came to, when we were starting to talk about that as a product in our previous call<br>or previous previous call, that was when I said, okay, let&#8217;s have a conversation offline cuz I think<br>maybe I&#8217;ve got a solution for this. Um, so in [00:17:00] parallel, for a few months now, um, I built.<br>Little SAS app, basically web service, um, called screenshot.express and haven&#8217;t launched it.<br>That was if, if you follow me on Twitter, or I think I might have mentioned here too, like this is a<br>product that I built, um, and the a p I works, it works as a, is a little screenshotting platform. Um,<br>but what I really wanted it for was, yes, it&#8217;s great for taking a screenshot of a website, but if it<br>can take a picture of, of, of a website.<br>But that website could be the size and shape of a Twitter banner or, you know, could be a, um, a<br>slide. Then we&#8217;re now talking about using H T M L to, to define a layout. Whatever we want that<br>to look like. And then taking pictures of it. And then there you&#8217;ve got your image and so, and CR<br>and [00:18:00] generating different types of H T M L pages and also taking advantage of res, the<br>responsiveness of, of layout.<br>So it&#8217;s like if you have a header and some text next to each other, but on mobile, the he, the<br>header goes above the text with one H T M L output. You take two pictures, one wide and one<br>narrow. You&#8217;ve now got a, uh, a Twitter banner and you know, a mobile screenshot or whatever.<br>So it&#8217;s like, I realized that in parallel, I&#8217;ve already got this little service that will potentially solve<br>the technical aspect of this.<br>Um, and so that was where sort of all this came together and we went, wow, that&#8217;s, that to me is<br>a much bigger thing. Um, and so as you said at the, the beginning of my ramble, like, we see<br>this as a, as a much bigger product to me, right away my gut says, okay, that&#8217;s much more of a,<br>something we could sell. You know, it&#8217;s, [00:19:00] it&#8217;s a big packageable thing.<br>Whereas crop Express, it was like, this is a great little utility. It solves a neat little problem. And<br>we could probably keep adding some things or, or splashing around in the problem until we<br>found something that would, people pay, would pay a little bit for. Um, but this to me seems like<br>something much bigger.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah, for sure. And I don&#8217;t, um, my tendency is always like, oh, let&#8217;s go, let&#8217;s go.<br>And I&#8217;m trying to really not do that because I, I wanna be careful, you, you in particular. Me too.<br>But you, um, as a developer on the partner, um, and lead on this, I, I wanna be really careful<br>with the time. Mm-hmm. Um, because I, I think we both go, we did something of value here, and<br>I wanna be a little bit more calculated than I have in the past about Okay.<br>Because I can blow these ideas up and go, okay, I see these, what I don&#8217;t wanna do is just do<br>that in a [00:20:00] vacuum. Um, not to like you and I are doing this, but I, I want to, I feel like<br>there&#8217;s something so powerful of getting to whatever the person is trying to do, like having<br>somebody in mind, or talking to people and seeing what they.<br>Talk about it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s funny. So with product at post status, I go, just to give you kind of a parallel<br>about how I&#8217;ve historically think about product and need to change and, and evolve, is I go,<br>okay, for our agency, we, we saw real quickly becoming an owner post status that, um, okay,<br>product people, smaller group of people than you got hosting companies, you have<br>professionals that do all the work.<br>But I really honed in on, there&#8217;s a lot of WordPress agencies out there, and I don&#8217;t see in this<br>space a lot of people that there are really cool companies doing really high-end work for<br>agencies like [00:21:00] Troy, Dean&#8217;s work, um, uro, different things like that. But I go, okay, I,<br>for me, Passion and ability and go.<br>I&#8217;d love to promote and help people tell stories and draw expertise. So long story short, besides<br>just Slack and e and our email newsletter, I think we can offer more to them. Where I&#8217;m at in that<br>product is really interesting for me. Frustrating. I shouldn&#8217;t say interesting. I don&#8217;t wanna say<br>interesting.<br>It&#8217;s frustrating as hell is I go, we could do mar co-marketing for these agencies. Now you know<br>how it is, you bring in an idea to somebody else. It&#8217;s so different from the my uh, the, my big Fat<br>Greek wedding when he goes, you have to make it his idea. And I go, oh, that&#8217;s so true with me<br>too. But, but I go, if you get to customer and see what they&#8217;re doing, um, potential customer and<br>just talk.<br>So like in my interviews with the agency owners, one of the things they stand up, but I<br>[00:22:00] think there&#8217;s a bias cause I&#8217;m coming at as post status. Um, and one of the features<br>we&#8217;ve had in our products is job listings. I go. That&#8217;s what they tend to have gravitated toward it.</p>



<p>And I go, well, I don&#8217;t know what more else we could potentially offer in that, but keep getting<br>pros in there.<br>And so that&#8217;s like existing product, just trying to make it better, which is valid foundational. I<br>wanted to do more for them. Now this is where we&#8217;re in that process and, but I don&#8217;t want it to<br>be like, I got this cool idea. Cuz then you&#8217;re kind of just striking trying to try to hit a hit, a hit a<br>winning lado.<br>Um, but that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m at, you know? And, um, with this my mind went to, oh, I mean we, we<br>were talking about our own problems right now, and then we&#8217;re using some clients and different<br>things to think about that. But before we go, I wanna make sure [00:23:00] specifically first and<br>foremost on your behalf is we. Gets some validation.<br>A little spark of something. Yeah. And collect enough sparks that go, this could be a fire. Right?<br>This could be, I just, I wanna do that cuz my tendency is I&#8217;m an DF fair and you know, I dr at the<br>opportunity to work with a great developer like yourself and, and product person like yourself.<br>And, uh, so anyway, that&#8217;s where my mind tends to go.<br>But this is interesting to both of us. Um, now it&#8217;s like if you got a hammer, everything looks like,<br>like a nail. Uh, I wanna be careful of that in this.<br>Corey Maass: Yeah, sure. And I tend to build first and ask questions later. We know this, so,<br>which is<br>Cory Miller: freaking cool. I think that&#8217;s better. See, it would be better as an idea person to be<br>able to build it first too.<br>Right. And say, but I just, I wanna be careful cause I don&#8217;t have those skillsets.</p>



<p>Corey Maass: Well, and, and this one is, I think one of the other things I mentioned in the pre-<br>roll is [00:24:00] this is a much bigger lift. Yeah. And so I&#8217;m also, my brain is saying there&#8217;s, there</p>



<p>are red flags here to that approach. Crop express, small, you know, crank something out, get it,<br>you know, we, the prototype is going to be straightforward, uh, or was straightforward and, and<br>you coming in and going start with featured images.<br>Great. Even simpler. So we&#8217;ve got one and it turned out to be replicable. So then media library,<br>um, block, um, we did have to hire somebody to get us over a couple of hurdles, but for the<br>most part, Replicable, um, reusable code and all at once. Whereas this, I mean, so I already<br>started my intention of spinning up screenshot express, which is abstract.<br>And I knew that. I&#8217;m like, this is probably isn&#8217;t a thing. I&#8217;m gonna, [00:25:00] I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m gonna sell<br>on its own. There are, and there are people who are making progress with, with other products<br>that take screenshots. And I admire that because I&#8217;m like, this is a, this is a service. This is a,<br>this a hundred percent a solution looking for a problem.<br>And so it&#8217;ll be other developers or me as a developer that uses this tool for whatever problem.<br>And so it&#8217;s like the, I said about building a, a WordPress plugin, which I think you and I should<br>review and start pulling apart and see what we can do with, um, But it&#8217;s, uh, to generate social<br>images to accompany a post.<br>Um, and so the good news is, yeah, I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve solved some of the, like, some of the problems,<br>like, what do I wanna say, as a product, it&#8217;s more complicated and involving a third party service,<br>like screenshot.express is more complicated. And [00:26:00] then setting up different images for<br>different use cases is complicated.<br>And, uh, and solving the right problems is complicated. It&#8217;s like you go to Canva, they&#8217;ve got like,<br>not only do they have all the assets and stuff, but they&#8217;ve got a gajillion templates. What do you<br>wanna make today? I wanna make an Instagram post. I wanna make a, you know, a music<br>video. I wanna make a dot, dot dot.<br>Like all these things. So somebody had to sit down and, and make templates out of all those<br>things. Um, and so it&#8217;s building, this is going, you know, as already. Even though I&#8217;ve solved<br>some of the problems connecting to the p i of Screenshot express and stuff is like, all of that is<br>more complicated, a much more complicated user experience.<br>Um, before we even get to the fun part of like, okay, now we can just build a gajillion templates<br>and hope that one of them is the right thing and, and, and on and on. So, um, so yeah, it, it<br>strikes me that you doing more interviews, re more research, [00:27:00] um, us getting more<br>answers, um, before I, like, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m inclined to, I keep waiting for you to say, like you saying,<br>featured image early on was such a pivotal point, like, here&#8217;s how we simplify this big,<br>complicated thing to start with.</p>



<p>Um, so no pressure, but I&#8217;m waiting for you to come up with that again. Um, but I do think that<br>since I&#8217;ve got, since I&#8217;m close to having s a, an initial. Social image generator plugin forward<br>WordPress using Screenshot express that maybe we start there cuz it does solve the problem.<br>Um, enough for us to, for, for you to get eyes on it as far as user experience and go, yeah, no,<br>this is, you&#8217;ve made it as you, Corey have made it as simple as possible.<br>It&#8217;s good enough. You know, we can, we can [00:28:00] tolerate people, people will tolerate<br>stepping through this pro progress process, even though it&#8217;s a handful of steps to get the value<br>that we are creating at the end. Um, and then, and we keep having these conversations like we<br>did with Crop Express, where we go, okay, wait, but if we put this over here, it makes more<br>sense in context.<br>Or if we mm-hmm. You know, connected to a different service or we put it in front of certain<br>kinds of people, um, then. It&#8217;ll take us, it&#8217;ll take us to it. It&#8217;ll help us grow.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah. Uh, I just asked ChatGPT what are the most popular features of Canva?<br>Hmm. So that, that&#8217;s interesting. Um, excuse me, because we&#8217;ve mentioned that a number of<br>times and different photo editing tool.<br>Um, I think so two parts, making sure I really understand what Screenshotted Express can do at<br>the moment. Um, [00:29:00] but two, I think in this next experiment is having, having a default<br>customer in mind. Yeah. And, you know, sizing that market, the, the person that we know, that<br>we think we understand or have some connections with.<br>And then seeing how that market is. Because it cur, it occurs to me like I told you with backup<br>buddy. I go, well, that&#8217;s a hundred percent. Theoretically, theoretically, everyone should want a,<br>a backup for their WordPress site, right? Um, that was easy, right? Because the, you know,<br>we&#8217;re gonna go into this field and we&#8217;re gonna hit something.<br>Um,<br>Corey Maass: But to, but I think to your point, like your average non nerd or non-professional<br>doesn&#8217;t think about that. You know, there&#8217;s a reason why they are automatically that most<br>hosting companies [00:30:00] offer automatic backups. And even if they don&#8217;t, I almost can<br>guarantee that they&#8217;re doing at least some periodic, because the majority of their support tickets<br>are, I broke my site, or somebody hacked my site.<br>What? And I, you know, and, and support. A technician comes back and says, great, what<br>about, what do you have for backups? And the person goes, what&#8217;s a backup? And then they<br>go, oh, well you are lucky on our server in a very hidden technical way. I can at least restore it<br>from seven days ago or from yesterday or what have you.<br>You know, but you should have thought about this and then mm-hmm. You know, but, but your<br>average person doesn&#8217;t think about backups. Right. Um, so you still, you were solving a problem<br>that everybody has, but most people don&#8217;t know they have. Mm-hmm.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah. And, and where when we get the main product out, we&#8217;re able to do<br>[00:31:00] content marketing around all the reasons why it would be good.<br>We even created a content, um, content replacement calendar or something. We tried to say,<br>what&#8217;s the value of all your posts? Because I lost, uh, I lost things from my personal website<br>when we had a server crash. Now, you know, there they weren&#8217;t invaluable, but it was, it was a<br>headache. So we started doing that to try to map that out.<br>But, um, when we talk about avatars for a second, um, we have your clients content journey,<br>and then the, what I hear over, and it&#8217;s so interesting, my, my own perception of WordPress has<br>changed so much. Um, but what I hear over and over from our agencies and owners and things<br>is that the people running when they deliver projects, I, it&#8217;s really compelling that it&#8217;s marketing<br>[00:32:00] specific people.<br>Mm-hmm. I just got outta the, a agency owners meetup and it was again, like they&#8217;re turning<br>sites over and typically it&#8217;s marketing related type. People are actually the people using their<br>WordPress sites from enterprise. WordPress does really good in the enterprise because<br>marketers go, it&#8217;s cheaper, it&#8217;s faster, and I can use it.<br>So I, I would say like in this backup buddy thought, I go big market, I am a marketer. I go that,<br>that&#8217;s really compelling. Which is why when we talked about screenshotted express, I was like<br>the social images. I, but I don&#8217;t, I gotta admit, make sure I&#8217;m honest about this. I don&#8217;t do that. I<br>don&#8217;t really post to our website.<br>Um, we have team and content journey and different things that do that. But if we take that a,<br>that&#8217;s one big avatar. I can like say, generally speaking, [00:33:00] if we hit the marketing room</p>



<p>and that&#8217;s the, the sexy make you look better, make money kind of realm. Yeah. So there&#8217;s one,<br>um, I think about yours as a lot of publishers, um, uh, publishers.<br>But even like a lot of the content journey, you know, clients, um, it&#8217;s, it kind of boils down to the<br>marketing people. They&#8217;re the ones interfacing with those clients. Yeah. Very.<br>Corey Maass: Yep. Um, yeah, we&#8217;ve got, I&#8217;ve got a couple of different scenarios. One is on one<br>team, we have a person dedicated to social media. Um, and I am, so, so there&#8217;s an interview I<br>want to have, um, customer interview, like talk to them about how they&#8217;re making stuff.<br>I think they&#8217;re using Canva. Um, and I think that they&#8217;ve got template set up so that, again, it&#8217;s,<br>they plug in a featured [00:34:00] image, they plug in a featured image, but it&#8217;s got the same<br>treatment every time. Um, I want to make sure of. And I&#8217;d love, we&#8217;ll have you talk to them if, if<br>you&#8217;re following the, um, mom interview methodology.<br>Um, cuz I&#8217;d also, I think what would be really interesting would be, I have a history of taking, uh,<br>blue ocean products and, and rebuilding them, repurposing them for WordPress. Um,<br>sometimes with legit value and sometimes just because it&#8217;s a smaller market, so it&#8217;s easier to<br>focus. And, and I&#8217;m still fascinated with the idea of WordPress being the control panel for a, a<br>person&#8217;s entire business.<br>Um, but I also would be curious if, you know, sorry. Um, if the people are who, if they are<br>jumping into Canva, are they struggling? Like, is it too many choices? [00:35:00] Is it, um,<br>repeatable? Uh, sorry, I gotta let a dog in. Hold on.<br>Cory Miller: Go, go for it. I, I&#8217;m opening up a y board to take some notes.<br>Corey Maass: And thankfully my spouse stepped in and cornered him. Um, but yeah, it&#8217;s, you<br>know, so is, is there value in generating these things from WordPress with the expectation that,<br>like I just wrote, wrote a blog post, and as we talked about before, you know, there&#8217;s the, the last<br>10% or the, you know, maybe it&#8217;s, let&#8217;s use 80 20, right?<br>Like 80% of what should be the process is writing a blog post. But at least in our experience,<br>80% of the pain is. Um, the technically speaking anyway is going and finding an image,<br>cropping [00:36:00] an image, all that kind of stuff, which is what we were trying to solve with<br>Crop Express. And so, um, you know, is it, is it parallel here where it&#8217;s like, okay, I&#8217;ve written a<br>blog post now what?<br>And I think that that&#8217;s a big problem, uh, to solve. Uh, or it&#8217;s a, a question that, that we wanna be<br>careful. We want to do a good job of defining the question to then come up with the solution.<br>Um, and so it&#8217;s, you know, our people. If, if, if we can get to the point where you&#8217;ve generated a<br>blog post, click a button, and then you&#8217;ve got assets, that&#8217;s amazing.<br>Um, is that enough? How hard or difficult is it to create those assets? Because it&#8217;s like Canva<br>offers creativity. Right. You can do anything all the time forever. But I, for me, um, like I have a<br>music blog, and so every time I, [00:37:00] or one of my writers writes a review, I go into Canva<br>and I open exa, I open the same design, I say duplicate page.<br>I change the title. I change the, so that it has the same treatment, right? Like, I&#8217;m not doing what<br>Canva kind of seems to want you to do, which is starting from scratch every single time.<br>Because I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m not doing that. I&#8217;m not trying to be that creative, and in fact, that takes way<br>more time rather than, You know, a quick, simple 32nd, copy, paste, change, title, publish.<br>Um, and so I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m intrigued to find out if I&#8217;m right about that. Um, mm-hmm. You know, if, if our<br>team, if my teammate, somebody writes a story, publishes a story, like we have professional<br>writers who are writing, um, you know, long form content, and then we&#8217;ve got, again, a separate<br>[00:38:00] person whose job it is in part to create social media content from that story to then<br>publish everywhere.<br>Um, and I&#8217;d be interested to know if it&#8217;s a simple process for them or, uh, the hypothesis similar<br>to the crop express hypothesis is are they going, you know, the hard part should be. Putting all<br>this stuff out there, looking at the analytics, like creating a, essentially a, a mini campaign, um, to<br>promote this blog post.<br>But most of the pain is actually going in and, and cropping an image and adding the treatment<br>and all that kind of stuff. Um, and if, and if there&#8217;s value in having that sit in WordPress<br>alongside the blog post, um, you know, whether it&#8217;s under media or whether it&#8217;s going into the<br>post and then seeing a little icon that opens up an app or, you know, whatever approach it is,<br>um, you know, to make sure that there&#8217;s as much benefit there as we&#8217;re [00:39:00] hoping.<br>Cory Miller: Okay. I&#8217;m trying to make sure I take all these,</p>



<p>um, okay. So, um, potential avatars, I think we&#8217;ve said marketing. I try to put a little bit. Thing<br>here. We got publishers I added in here. Um, because one thing that kind of, if you, if I just<br>camp out in this marketing realm, um, I thought about screenshot express, and I go ebook<br>creation or lead magnet creation.<br>Mm-hmm. Like the covers. Mm-hmm. Um, you know, some kind of cover. Now I think that would<br>also lend to this featured image creation in the sense of those graphics you talked about with<br>post status. Like we got the featured image graphic that we kind of pulled together, but it just<br>kind of made me [00:40:00] think like outputs, maybe I should put that here.<br>Uh, outputs,<br>um, social images, we said this, uh, featured images, uh, oh e let me just say ebook coverage,<br>just in the realm of possibility here. Yep.<br>Corey Maass: Slides was the thing that got you your gears turning early on.<br>Cory Miller: I was thinking of tip boxes. Lemme see if I can share my screen. Nope. I have to<br>close the Y board. I was on, uh, CAO&#8217;s website looking at their di i y lighting kit and they had a<br>pullout with a tip. Oh, okay. So I, I don&#8217;t know how to call, like pull out, pull out boxes and I<br>guess that could be quotes<br>they call to action. Hmm. Um, like, [00:41:00] well, let&#8217;s put ads, ads into Oh yeah. Post et<br>cetera. Wow. Yeah.<br>Corey Maass: Wow. Wow. Ads like auto ad gener, ad ad image generator from a Woo<br>commerce product. Mm. Holy crap.<br>Cory Miller: That could be coupons, like mm-hmm. I, I was even thinking your HTML side, cuz<br>you&#8217;re generating H M L and then you&#8217;re taking the snapshot of it.<br>But like, you know, Kohl&#8217;s or Bed Bath and Beyond, you know, they have a coupon and it looks<br>like a little coupon thing. And I mean, if there&#8217;s HTML, if we&#8217;re generating HTML, don&#8217;t even, you<br>don&#8217;t have to go to the screenshot if you don&#8217;t want to, but like, you could put that with a little<br>dressing that kind of calls it out, so.<br>Yep. Um,[00:42:00]<br>okay, let me, let&#8217;s do this for a second. Let&#8217;s take this marketing because I think we, there&#8217;s the<br>big market, bigger market there. It&#8217;s a lot of the users. When I think about creating a blog post,<br>I&#8217;m thinking about organic search traffic primarily. Um, But so that it gets placed in the search<br>engine, uh, it gets ranked and then traffic comes to that page.<br>When they get on page, then I want them to do something. This is where, you know, Optum<br>monitor or popup thing is like compelling because it&#8217;s, you get attention, like offer free offer<br>inside, right?<br>Corey Maass: Kind of thing. Yeah. It turns, it turns passive into, uh, there&#8217;s ac there&#8217;s<br>something&#8217;s actionable. Yeah. So it&#8217;s not, don&#8217;t just consume, like, and so this is where you&#8217;ve<br>got, uh, share these, bookmark these, you know, it&#8217;s like, so I&#8217;m reading somebody&#8217;s article and<br>yet I get a popup that says, [00:43:00] want more great content like this?<br>Sign up. Want an ebook of related content? Sign up. Um, here, share buttons. Please share this<br>on, you know, if you got value out of this, share this on Twitter. Um, email it to a friend. Um, but<br>thinking in terms of, yeah, images, um, so, you know, if we&#8217;re just talking content, written words,<br>then, um, my, the featured image that you&#8217;d see ideally would be stylized, something that fits in<br>with your site.<br>But if you ask a guest to share this story on Twitter, big pretty image is obviously more<br>compelling than just a, a headline. Um, but you don&#8217;t want to share the featured image because<br>the featured image probably doesn&#8217;t have, uh, the title of the post. Uh, it might or might not, but<br>it certainly, what I, what I thought you, a brilliant idea you came up with was, [00:44:00] you<br>know, a featured image with a, or, or a shareable image, which is the featured includes the<br>featured image, the title of the post, and then one or two.<br>It could be the excerpt, it could be one or two bullet points, but, so it&#8217;s like if I go to share, if I<br>read an article, You know, and it has a pretty image of a, some sunset and it says, best places<br>to retirement, retire to, okay. But if I&#8217;m sharing an image on Twitter, the image that I share should<br>say the best places to retire to should have the sunset in the background.<br>And then, you know, a, a tag, an excerpt that says the results will blow you away. Total click bait.<br>Or, you know, the top, you know, should say the top five, Hawaii, Alaska, blah, blah, blah. You<br>know, click to read the rest of &#8217;em, kind of thing. So then it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, um, you know, and that&#8217;s<br>different from the featured image and that&#8217;s different from, that&#8217;s the type of thing you&#8217;d run over</p>



<p>to Canva and, and generate and, and maybe [00:45:00] generate in a number of different sizes<br>and shapes to then push, you know, drag into buffer or whatever you use to schedule your<br>socials or to broadcast your socials.<br>I definitely wanna make sure we don&#8217;t get into that realm. Um, Because interacting with all those<br>APIs is a nightmare, and there&#8217;s a hundred of those tools already. But, um, oh, and, um, Yost, sh<br>uh, the OG image, uh, is the other one. So again, if an image that&#8217;s different from you&#8217;ve got<br>your featured image, you go and you, you pa paste the URL into Twitter or into Slack, and you<br>get that little preview card, that&#8217;s your open graph image.<br>Twitter now has Twitter cards, which is their version. And so again, having different, different<br>versions generated for all of these things. And some of this I think we can do even behind the<br>scenes, which I think will be really, really neat. And then some of this I think could be, and then<br>it&#8217;s like, [00:46:00] so maybe that&#8217;s where, you know, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re, we haven&#8217;t yet talked about.<br>I mean, we&#8217;re not, we&#8217;re not ready yet to talk about business models and that kind of thing, but<br>hypothetically, a. Beginner version that just does a couple of the basic things. Here&#8217;s a<br>shareable image. Um, or here&#8217;s the, the open graph image for every post, every product<br>automatically generated, done. Um, and that&#8217;s not necessar.<br>That&#8217;s maybe something that people can set and forget kind of thing. But then we&#8217;re also talking<br>about, in my mind at least, we&#8217;re talking about something that approaches more of a Canva kind<br>of functionality for marketers. So it&#8217;s like, yes, the, the basics are covered, the incoming stuff is<br>covered, or the quick share, uh, in Slack preview is covered.<br>Um, but then talking about, you know, saying, okay, now I need the list of assets that I&#8217;ve<br>[00:47:00] predefined, I wanna slide for, um, you know, for social medias. Cuz it&#8217;s like, and if<br>you. If you&#8217;re doing it right, air quotes, right? You are not posting about a, a blog post once you<br>are not, uh, putting an image into or putting a product into woo commerce, tweeting about it<br>once and then hoping that it sells a gajillion, you are again, creating a campaign that says, okay,<br>you know, over the next six months, tweet about this every couple of days, every then, every<br>few days in it, every once a week.<br>And you sort of, you might peter off, but there&#8217;s this arc and you want those images to be<br>potentially to be different every time. And so it&#8217;s like, could you generate a bunch of images that<br>then get cued, um, you know, on all different platforms. And so it&#8217;s like potentially you&#8217;re talking<br>about, um, oh, I think the other neat thing that you mentioned in a previous conversation was<br>like, Answer a few questions, [00:48:00] right?<br>So it&#8217;s like word w WordPress is already gonna ask you for an excerpt fine. But it&#8217;s like, what are<br>three bullet points? What are two or three quotes? And then if it auto-generated a whole bunch<br>of images that had the quotes, that had the, um, oh, you know what, uh, uh, what&#8217;s analogous?<br>Like there&#8217;s, um, what&#8217;s it called?<br>Um, I have a book marked, um, avatar Image. Photo.<br>Cory Miller: Oh, yeah. Avatars.<br>Corey Maass: So there&#8217;s, um, yeah. Avatars. And so basically kind of creating little avatar<br>images for, um,<br>Cory Miller: I mean, profile cards, you know, like, right.<br>Corey Maass: So yeah. So p fp maker.com. P fp maker mm-hmm. Profile pick maker. Is what<br>it&#8217;s short for, right? But you upload a photo of yourself, it, it [00:49:00] strips the background out,<br>and then it, and then it just delivers you a page full of avatars.<br>So it&#8217;s your photo over and over again, but all these different funky backgrounds. And so you<br>scroll through them and you&#8217;re like, Ooh, I like that one. I like that one. I like that one. Um, I<br>think, yeah, go to my Twitter account and you&#8217;ll see one, and I use this to just like, I go, I upload<br>this to, we&#8217;ve looked at the, um, sticker mule background remover kind of thing.<br>Um, and I think there&#8217;s, remove.bg was one that I just found recently. That&#8217;s a great r l. But so<br>it&#8217;s like you create an image, you take an image of yourself, you use a tool to strip the<br>background, and then you upload it here. And now you&#8217;ve got, you know, a dozen or two or<br>three dozen different backgrounds and they&#8217;ve got ones with palm trees and the Eiffel Tower,<br>which is fun, right?<br>But so picturing like, You know, you write a blog post, you create a new Woo commerce product,<br>you go, you, you hit publish. And, and then, you know, our plugin essentially says, okay,<br>[00:50:00] you&#8217;re ready to create marketing assets. Um, what do you want to create today?</p>



<p>Twitter, Instagram, you know, and then, great, what&#8217;s, what&#8217;s the headline, which we can auto,<br>auto pull.<br>Um, what&#8217;s the excerpt? We, again, we can auto pull, um, featured image to start with, right?<br>But maybe you wanna upload other ones. Um, what are three bullet points? What are some pull<br>quotes? What are some benefi, you know, we can sort of customize a questionnaire that says,<br>fill these in, generate. And then now you&#8217;ve got essentially a matrix that&#8217;s like, you know, an<br>image for Twitter, an image for Facebook, an image for do, do, do, do.<br>And going across. You&#8217;ve got quote, quote, Bullet point, bullet point, bullet point, style, style,<br>style, um, you know, light mode, dark mode, play with fonts kind of thing. Um mm-hmm. You<br>know, and it, and so you suddenly, you&#8217;ve got a catalog of generated relevant images designed<br>to go on a bunch of different platforms and you&#8217;d [00:51:00] go, okay, yep, this one works.<br>This one works, this one&#8217;s silly. Ignore it, you know, whatever. Um, but<br>Cory Miller: so in, yeah, so in this, um, I went to the ChatGPT my researcher Yep. And, um,<br>image SEO came out and I was like, okay, if I&#8217;m embodying, um, I&#8217;m trying to do this, I&#8217;m<br>publishing site content in order to get ranked in Google. And you get on here, if you&#8217;ve done all<br>the work to do an SEO o keyword blog post, you&#8217;re using WordPress.<br>Great platform to do that. You go what was be one extra while you&#8217;re already there to get a little<br>bit extra stuff. Mm-hmm. And this Image SEO thing popped up in the list that I asked. Mm-hmm.<br>And it&#8217;s kind of compelling. Um,<br>and I read something just a second ago, uh, and I checked out your profile maker too. That&#8217;s<br>super cool. [00:52:00] Um, half of all Google searches end on the searcher. So wait, I&#8217;m sorry. I<br>thought I was saying how, how big SEO image SEO is, but we&#8217;re kind of saying that with the<br>social images too, is you&#8217;ve got this thing, there&#8217;s ways you can distribute your content in a way<br>out to the different platforms.<br>But I go Google too. Like I image should be, if we land on this should be a part of this<br>conversation. Mm-hmm. Because then you&#8217;re going, okay, ex. I mean, what if you could take<br>your blog posts, they get all this traffic and increase it by 10%? That&#8217;s a headline. Wow. Or the,<br>the product. So, you know, well, like you talked about e-commerce, um, what if there&#8217;s a way to<br>generate, easily an image that could be feature post featured image post or [00:53:00]<br>something in, in the thing.<br>But it also gets some SEO ranking when they&#8217;re going, and I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t do this myself, but,<br>um, I don&#8217;t look for images in Google necessarily, but it just compelling to kind explore that. Do<br>you? Okay. Yeah.<br>Corey Maass: Like we talked about, I think, I think it would be really interesting to know, like, I, I<br>make the assumption that Google looks at images more than alt tag, title tag.<br>Like, I think we&#8217;re to the point. I, I, I.<br>Safe assumption, I don&#8217;t know. Um, but I assume that Google can, if they look at a blog post,<br>they look at the image, they read the alag, but then they actually parse the image and say, yes,<br>this is in fact an image of a sunset when we&#8217;re talking about places to vacation. I don&#8217;t know if<br>that&#8217;s true. I&#8217;d love to find out if that&#8217;s [00:54:00] true.<br>But it&#8217;s like, so if you have an image that has words on it, I mean, at this point when I open an<br>image with words on it in, you know, Mac preview or Microsoft Paint, the words are editable. So<br>the, uh, algorithm for parsing text in an image is so commonplace now that it&#8217;s built into the, the<br>free image editor on, on Mac Os.<br>So I have to assume that it&#8217;s that pervasive everywhere. So, Um, you know, so is there a, an<br>SEO benefit to having words in an image that then gets shared? Um mm-hmm. Or no?<br>Cory Miller: Well, I mean, I would go, if you&#8217;re gonna post an image, you know, your tourism,<br>your e-commerce shop, you&#8217;re, why not? You&#8217;ve already got the images there.<br>Yeah. Um, you should be doing some image sto. I mean, that&#8217;s just easy, you know, a little bit<br>more effort and you&#8217;re able to, [00:55:00] I don&#8217;t know, cast a net water, but I go, if you&#8217;re gonna<br>post, uh, I don&#8217;t know, air compressors in somebody&#8217;s trying to find, you know, whatever the<br>reason they might be looking for that.<br>But you post a picture of the image compressor, that&#8217;s one thing. But I&#8217;ve seen more images too<br>come up where it&#8217;s like, put a little bit of text on there or it branded, you know, or I don&#8217;t know. I<br>like that mindset of going, how do we help them get a little bit more. Um, reach from something<br>they&#8217;re probably already doing.</p>



<p>Corey Maass: Um, right. I googled how to do image seo and one of the results that came up,<br>so the first sponsored post, uh, is the, the image next to it is dude on laptop. The, the image<br>adds nothing to the headline, how to optimize images for websites. And [00:56:00] there&#8217;s a<br>picture of a dude with a, with a laptop, no value, no context, like if that image came outta<br>context, there&#8217;s nothing there.<br>Scroll down, um, to another one. 10 steps to optimize images for seo, and next to it is a card<br>that has. People, you know, a little graphic of people. Awesome. But it&#8217;s in, in text, even though<br>the image is this big in text that almost fills the card. It has the same headline, 10 steps to<br>optimize images for seo.<br>And there&#8217;s a little logo of the website that it&#8217;s on, and if I click on it and it gets bigger, there&#8217;s the<br>subtitle that&#8217;s like, you know, who&#8217;s who. It&#8217;s by when it was posted. Um, you know, and it&#8217;s like<br>right there. That&#8217;s the image that we&#8217;re talking, we&#8217;re talking about generating, but somebody<br>had to go in and create that card.<br>Well, so I figure if, if, if the, if the third result for searching for Google for [00:57:00] Image SEO<br>is an article about optimizing images for seo, and they include an image that has words on it.<br>You know, and, and like, I mean, we we&#8217;re talking about Google, you know, the, the automation,<br>the bots, the algorithms, the, you know, the ai, whatever. But I mean, the obvious benefit is of<br>just human stuff is obvious. Like putting something on Twitter, an image that has words rather<br>than an image of just a dude on a laptop.<br>Yeah. Obvi, you know, obvious value, but, well, but we do, I thought about Pinterest.<br>Cory Miller: Mm-hmm. Yep. Oh yeah. It&#8217;s, I forget about it all the time, but I mean, there&#8217;s so<br>many that go, like, it&#8217;s a pin and you&#8217;re looking for stuff and mm-hmm. You know, taking, it&#8217;s a<br>way to get a tra traffic back to your post about it.<br>Well put enough detail that entices them to come over. Yep. Um, okay. I wanna get back to<br>[00:58:00] this. Okay. I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m doing a post and, and may, maybe there&#8217;s others, but I think about<br>just. I spent my career with the organic SEO content, um, and I get somebody to the site, and<br>that&#8217;s the first part of the big, the whole process, just getting someone to the site.<br>Um, it talked about like popups help you, you know, do that. Mm-hmm. There&#8217;s inbound content,<br>like now that we have patterns within Gutenberg, code editor, block editor, like inserting<br>something called a action within that. Um, my traditional has been get &#8217;em on the site and give<br>them some offer that fills irresistible discount, ebook, lead magnet, you know, opt into the<br>newsletter thing.<br>Corey Maass: Yep.[00:59:00]<br>And I&#8217;m, and I, what I&#8217;m thinking is, Sim similar to our previous conversations. You know, it&#8217;s<br>gonna take a handful of conversations to continue to unearth all of these possibilities, right?<br>This list, which already is 10 points long, is gonna be a lot longer. And so I want some<br>confirmation, like there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s an, to me, there&#8217;s an obvious benefit of like what I just<br>described.<br>I&#8217;m seeing a card, a text on it that somebody had to generate. Do we, can we confirm that your<br>average team of one a person who&#8217;s blogging, um, recipe, ooh, recipe cards, um, do they.<br>[01:00:00] More of these images generated and or are they already trying to generate these<br>images? Are they, you know, is, is the average, um, person, you know, a team of one or two,<br>um, who&#8217;s got a, a YouTube vlog or a recipe blog or whatever.<br>Are they posting their article with the recipe? And then what are the next steps they take? Like,<br>that&#8217;s the broad question. Do they then go generate images to then put on socials and how do<br>they schedule, you know, all that stuff? What are the images that they actually care about? Um,<br>to me the, the gut assumption is there are enough people doing something as a next step.<br>And so I&#8217;m inclined to. Um, again, get to a point where I&#8217;ve essentially solved a problem for<br>generating something. And to me, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I have no problem solving this for me [01:01:00] and<br>you to start with. Mm-hmm. Um, where I&#8217;m generating my images from my music blog, I&#8217;m<br>generating a couple of basic templates for Instagram, whatever, me as a musician to promote.<br>Um, again, I&#8217;m looking at my clients like, what do they need? So a basic Twitter image with a<br>headline that has a logo on it. Um, and then for you, the post status, um, banners make, how do<br>we make them all look the same? So again, a logo and, you know, if, if these are all, um, I think<br>what we looked at, right? Were profiles of people.<br>So it&#8217;s upload a picture of the person, post status logo on the left, maybe their name and, um,<br>you know, and, and something from the, you know, and, and then. And then it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, to me, it&#8217;s,</p>



<p>it&#8217;s up to, again, we&#8217;re looking for feedback and or you doing some interviews to find out like,<br>yes, everybody, everybody wants Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, [01:02:00] LinkedIn, like the<br>obvious socials.<br>Um, or yes, people desperately wish that there were slides. Like, I love your interest in slides,<br>but you&#8217;re the only person I&#8217;ve ever heard of that says that. Um, which doesn&#8217;t dismiss it. It just<br>means like, that&#8217;s not the circle I&#8217;m in, right? So, um, yeah, that&#8217;s, to me, that&#8217;s not something we<br>want to generate first, but go find me 10 people that are gonna find that interesting.<br>Or if I get you to a point where you can sit down and generate pro templates yourself, you&#8217;ll be<br>like, cool, let me go build a slide one, because that&#8217;s what I want. And then, and then cuz it&#8217;s like<br>once, it&#8217;s kind of like Canva, like, you know, that they have somebody on staff whose job it is to<br>just crank out templates mm-hmm.<br>To solve all these little problems. Oh, whoops. We don&#8217;t have one for podcasts. Great. 3000 by</p>



<ol start="3000">
<li>Go, go generate that. Oh, there you go. Podcast. Um, yeah. Add that to your list. Um, or<br>we don&#8217;t, you know, [01:03:00] people are posting record their, their new album on, on<br>Bandcamp. What, how do you know an image generator for Bandcamp that I&#8217;m talking about<br>back to Canva?<br>It&#8217;s like they, because they&#8217;re going, they&#8217;re going inch deep, mile wide, you know. Yeah. So<br>they, they want one of everything, but there&#8217;s, you know, and for them, there&#8217;s s e o value, like,<br>you know, there&#8217;s a landing page for every single template they have. Because that way<br>anybody who&#8217;s googling for anything, you know, album cover template, they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re hoping to<br>pop up.<br>Mm-hmm. We&#8217;ll get there once we have the delivery system for templates, essentially. Um, and<br>I&#8217;m not saying we necessarily want to, like, we don&#8217;t wanna start there, like let&#8217;s find some clear<br>answers of, of what templates to build first, what, what problems to solve first.<br>Cory Miller: I, I&#8217;m still, uh, still so compelled by the slide content and I put in the crazy ideas<br>column Here is, uh, LinkedIn [01:04:00] slide content.<br>So the AJ told me about, find this link for you. Um, this service, it&#8217;s like a LinkedIn. You&#8217;ve seen<br>this on Instagram too. Um, I&#8217;ll find it. It&#8217;s a LinkedIn image carousel creator. You put your tweet in<br>and it&#8217;ll give you the, the slide content. Oh, Uhhuh. You know, when I tested that on LinkedIn<br>several years ago, my slide content got way more views than anything else I was doing.<br>And, uh, so I think even like for LinkedIn, um, you think about it, it&#8217;s like busy professionals used<br>to a common language of slides. Yep. Uh, and then being able to quickly get the information<br>without having to go through 1500 words. Yep. It&#8217;s still compelling to me.<br>Corey Maass: Um, well, and, and a, a neat coincidence, right?<br>I was like everybody else, I&#8217;m looking at, um, Twitter threads [01:05:00] about chat g p t<br>prompts. Um, or you know, what, what are 10 neat things that have happened in the 48 hours<br>since they released ChatGPT four, um, you know, people have generated re had it generate a<br>working version of pong, uh, in 60 seconds. I&#8217;d mean ridiculous things.<br>But one of the things that I saw was that I, that I was like, oh, this is actually relevant to the<br>world. Um, other than recreating pong, um, Is somebody dumped in an article and said, make,<br>make 10 slides. And it did. And I, yeah, they&#8217;re not styled or anything, but it&#8217;s just, here are the<br>bullet points that you&#8217;d wanna put on each.<br>So it&#8217;s like, uh, you know, have this talk to AI that then gen, you know, write a blog post, click a<br>button, chat, g p t or some other AI generates the slide content. We generate the slide images.<br>Yeah. Yeah. Holy crap.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah. On that [01:06:00] link too for you.<br>Corey Maass: Um, okay, so we&#8217;re over an hour. Where do we go? What&#8217;s next? How do we<br>start?<br>What do you wanna do? What are you gonna do today? Um, what do you want me to do? Who<br>are we gonna talk to? How are we gonna get clients? I think,<br>Cory Miller: I think, um, one area to explore is, um, talking to content journey. Seeing the output<br>of what they&#8217;re doing, asking about the problems and challenges they have in that process for<br>their clients.<br>Um, I just forgot, I think there&#8217;s an opportunity here to potentially innovate in this of here&#8217;s how<br>this is going, here&#8217;s how people do, what is the way to help you stand out? Hmm. So the<br>standout, and that&#8217;s why I say innovate, not just helping cure the workflow issue, but I think<br>[01:07:00] one thing I wanna really explore this time is can we innovate with something?</li>
</ol>



<p>That&#8217;s where I think the slide content, you know, whether it&#8217;s a valid thing or not, is in that realm<br>of they&#8217;re doing something. What&#8217;s way, one way that could help that content stand out even<br>more. It, it includes social images, it includes STO image, SEO and stuff like that. Um, I was<br>like, Lindsay has a mental health treatment center client.<br>And, and that&#8217;s probably one of their best case studies because they took a, aside from, you<br>know, rarely getting any content to, uh, tenant, I mean considerable. And it drove a lot of<br>business for &#8217;em. And, uh, you think about it, like I, I, I remember talking to him cuz I did some<br>consulting with them, with the client and they&#8217;re trying to find images.<br>That&#8217;s another issue we&#8217;ve talked about, but it&#8217;s out, that&#8217;s out there. It&#8217;s for somebody else&#8217;s<br>saw potentially. But you go, if they&#8217;re doing the image, what&#8217;s something that could help that<br>stand out? And it&#8217;s maybe a pull quote. [01:08:00] Mm-hmm. You know, from it or something like<br>that. That&#8217;s where I want to dig in is, um, I&#8217;ll talk to Emily over there.<br>Um, And, uh, ask some of that. They&#8217;ve got another service called my marketing assistant too.<br>And I&#8217;ll ask, what are some of the anonymized, um, client requests they get? Yeah, sure. They<br>do have a podcaster in their beta program. Um, prolific podcaster who uses a lot of the<br>distributed media. Um, like I think he probably uses his website as the base, but, um, a lot of the<br>requests he&#8217;s getting is, you know, create the thumbnails for those things that they do, use those<br>tools that we talked about.<br>But, uh, I think one thing that might give us an edge on this is just like creating a new standard<br>where everybody&#8217;s going like, whoa, whoa, how&#8217;d they do that? I want that too. Like I was telling<br>you about the Casto little tip box and stuff. [01:09:00] Um, so that&#8217;s what I would like to explore<br>in this and then just understand their process a little bit better.<br>And what would be something that doesn&#8217;t take a lot of time. But then enhances uh, the content<br>and makes it stand out a little bit more. And I mean, it could be that whole call to action thing,<br>you know? Um, like a, being able to stylize some, you know, for the treatment center it&#8217;s call us.<br>Cuz if they call, if someone calls the treatment center, they can really help them and understand<br>what the right fit is and all that kinda stuff.<br>So their call to action is, you know, I think it still is the case, but if they get a phone call, that&#8217;s<br>great. That&#8217;s where they want to be. And then that turns over their sales operation. I&#8217;m trying to<br>think of another client. Um, there&#8217;s a lot of b2b, so, um, B2B there too. That seems like<br>[01:10:00] another area where maybe big companies have innovated with the B2B space.<br>Let me put that in here cause I don&#8217;t want to drop this. Like, I have a friend that has a<br>manufacturing company. He does the air condit, the cooling compressor stuff. He remanufacture<br>them. And, uh, I mean, there&#8217;s a space with people with money, um, and it&#8217;s business money.<br>They go, oh, if it helps increase whatever their KPI is.<br>I mean, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s pretty big.<br>Corey Maass: Yeah. And I&#8217;ve got, I was just pinging, um, people within my client teams of like,<br>okay, who generates social media content so that I can line up an interview, talk to them about,<br>okay, what&#8217;s your process? Um, and I, and what&#8217;s kind of neat is, is again, I&#8217;ve got. It&#8217;s<br>technically the same, same [01:11:00] client, but I&#8217;ve got two websites, two teams that approach<br>things very differently.<br>One is, um, a lot more tech savvy and a lot more, um, trendy or, or, you know, they are active on<br>TikTok. We are advertising on TikTok, stuff like that. And the other one is, is a fairly traditional<br>news content magazine. Um, and, uh, with, and the, and the team is a lot less technical and we,<br>and we don&#8217;t need to be nearly as cutting edge or edge or trendy.<br>Um, and so I&#8217;m, I&#8217;ve kind of got a young hip social media marketer wizard, and then I&#8217;ve also got<br>people that are like, I write the article and then I go put it on Twitter. Um, and, and so I can kind<br>of see how, how two of these very different approaches go about solving more or less the same<br>problem. Yeah.<br>Cory Miller: And that featured image summary card type thing I think is still [01:12:00] really<br>compelling. I&#8217;m gonna highlight that. Where&#8217;s that? Yeah, I,<br>Corey Maass: I, that&#8217;s a very quick, easy win for anybody, not for us specifically. It&#8217;s like make<br>your featured image more compelling and, and much more valuable when shared.<br>Cory Miller: And because again, you know, look at outputs for that, you go, well that&#8217;s a<br>Pinterest thing. I mean, maybe that doesn&#8217;t get pinned, but it&#8217;s a social card. It could have<br>possibilities for the Pinterest stuff. It&#8217;s a visual thing that en might entice someone to go, oh,<br>that&#8217;s interesting. Um, and that stuff like to just do that pull image from post add overlay of.</p>



<p>There you go. Print, you know, I mean, as simple as that with the brand logo. Yep. Dacon or<br>something like that. Yep,<br>Corey Maass: yep. [01:13:00] Okay. Yeah. And there&#8217;s, and there&#8217;s, yeah, and there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a<br>couple of plugins out there that do something that touch on that. Um, and I&#8217;ve, I messed around<br>with one, not the other of the two that I know of, but they, they were, at least at the time, were,<br>were limited to generating, um, an open graph image.<br>I was like, generate image, paste it into Slack, you see the image. And I, and I was like, great,<br>but I, where do I write? Click Save as so that I can go post it to Twitter. Mm-hmm. It&#8217;s like, oh,<br>you know, it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s just in, it&#8217;s in your media library. It&#8217;s like, okay, well, And then<br>also what about all these other solutions or other scenarios?<br>Um, for me, I was just originally thinking the big socials, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,<br>Instagram. The big difference being 16, nine or square. But now we&#8217;re talking about, it&#8217;s like,<br>yeah, either easy ways to generate multiple variations and [01:14:00] stuff. It&#8217;s like this could go<br>a lot, a lot further. Um, so, but it&#8217;s, but I definitely, you know, there&#8217;s to talk about, you know,<br>people talk about competition.<br>It&#8217;s like, oh, the competition is Photoshop, Canva, um, nothing, nothing is always a, a<br>competitor. Um, you know, but also I, you know, there are other WordPress plugins that do<br>touch on this, so we&#8217;ll have to do a little research there too.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah, like the nothing part is me. Um, I created a blog post and then it&#8217;d be<br>probably nice to have some visual.<br>Icon, thumbnail featured image that, um, highlight some points in there, but, um, okay. That&#8217;ll be,<br>mine is exploring that with, uh, I&#8217;ll start with Emily cause she&#8217;s doing a lot of the team interface,<br>[01:15:00] cl team, client interface stuff. She seemed a pretty good volume of work. I like the<br>marketing angle. How do we, cuz that could go across any of these potential avatars if we&#8217;re<br>helping them do better marketing, um, redistribution, that&#8217;s the social images of seo, all that kind<br>of stuff.<br>Corey Maass: Yeah. Um, well, and um, again, I,<br>I wanna say I put my foot down cuz I think that&#8217;s a hilarious phrase. In a Mad Men 1960s<br>husband sort of way. I don&#8217;t make me put my foot down. Um, but I, I, I want to, I very adamantly<br>wanna draw the line at doing the posting or interacting with the socials. Um, other than like, we<br>can have a button that says, post this to Twitter and it just links, you know, we&#8217;ll throw you over<br>there kind of thing.<br>Cuz I&#8217;ve actually even, I [01:16:00] built a plugin at one point that you could queue up tweets,<br>but it&#8217;s like, it worked. But, you know, with all the drama around Twitter, a p i lately, let alone for<br>the last Yeah. 10 years, like, I don&#8217;t want to get into that. But, um, you know, one, one of the, we<br>were talking about. What are we talking about?<br>We must have been talking about, um, integration points with other tools, um, for Crop Express<br>anyway, it&#8217;s like, so if we generate images and then, and then I, you know, let&#8217;s, we can look at,<br>um, auto, you know, if you generate an, an open graph image that Yost automatically picks that<br>up. Um, so there&#8217;s an integration point.<br>Um, I use Buffer to post to mild my socials. Maybe they have an API or an integration point. So<br>it&#8217;s like we can, you know, there&#8217;s gonna be a potential for not only generating the images, but at<br>least getting them to the services that use those images. I don&#8217;t wanna become those [01:17:00]<br>services, but you know, there&#8217;s, we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve got an opportunity there too.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah. Okay. I put integrations with SEO plugins. Um,<br>That, that question<br>when I talk to Emily, I&#8217;ll ask, um, what, what are the common goals that they&#8217;re, are they trying to<br>push to a phone number? Are they trying to push to, um, an email list? It&#8217;s probably one of those<br>two, I would guess is building the appeal, unless social start<br>Corey Maass: higher up. Do they even, you know, are they thinking that strategically, like, not to<br>say the agency [01:18:00] isn&#8217;t or shouldn&#8217;t, but as a client, like if a client comes to &#8217;em as like,<br>we need images for Twitter, like, because everybody else does or because you under, you<br>know, they understand.<br>It&#8217;s the value in including a phone number.<br>Cory Miller: Now I do know, I do know, um, a lot of the clients they work with, and these are not<br>WordPress or tech people, um, social is hot, you know?</p>



<p>Corey Maass: Sure. Um, social hot, why, I guess, right? Mm-hmm. Cynically, are they doing it<br>because everybody tells them to, you know, are there, are there teenage kids telling them, dad,<br>you&#8217;ve gotta get your, um, shoe com, you know, your air compressor company on the tos.<br>And dad goes, okay, son, great, I&#8217;ll do that. You know, or, or are they measuring? [01:19:00] You<br>know, are they like, what, where does our traffic come from? Oh, we sell most of our air<br>compressors on Twitter, but not, or probably Facebook, but not on Twitter, and we&#8217;ve never.<br>Sold anything off of Insta, you know what I mean?<br>Like, I&#8217;m curious if, if, if, how companies are thinking about these, what am I trying to say? We<br>know in, especially in the context of this conversation, that there&#8217;s a potential to turn these pat<br>turn to turn passive images into valuable calls to action. Mm-hmm. To actually generate, you<br>know, it&#8217;s like I post an image, I post, I post something on Twitter.<br>It sucks In the featured image. The featured image is, you know, a pretty sunset. It, it might draw<br>a human&#8217;s attention, but that&#8217;s very different than again the card. Uh, the [01:20:00] s e o card<br>that I saw here, that&#8217;s like words that are also drawing me in to like a phone number. So it&#8217;s like,<br>wow, I don&#8217;t even have to click through.<br>To, uh, to find out a phone number. I&#8217;m just dialing eight eighty eight, et cetera. Mm-hmm. So it&#8217;s<br>like there&#8217;s, I, I&#8217;m curious how people are thinking about it, if they&#8217;re thinking about it, because if<br>not, like there&#8217;s great opportunity to ask for us to do education, um mm-hmm. And, or cuz it&#8217;s<br>like, we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve talked about, this is the first time you&#8217;ve mentioned phone numbers.<br>Um, so it&#8217;s like, you know, our, our default is like, oh, this is gonna go on Twitter and it&#8217;s gonna<br>look pretty, it&#8217;s gonna be the title of the post. Um, you know, with bullet points. It&#8217;s a tldr, but like<br>what you just said I think is amazing of like, imagine if for a small business, if it included the<br>phone number, the logo, and the phone number.<br>So it&#8217;s like nobody ever, or the address, right? Mm-hmm. So people don&#8217;t see it on Facebook or<br>see it on Twitter and they don&#8217;t even have to click through.<br>Cory Miller: [01:21:00] Mm-hmm. Then it&#8217;s an ad, right? Like, Retail shop coming up with<br>something, they&#8217;ve got an event, a coupon or something that could, they&#8217;re posting on their<br>website, so it&#8217;s RSVPs and then having a card that they could just easily go export or, you know,<br>save or whatever it is, and then they can go post that.<br>Corey Maass: How is the, we have a, a pie shop in town. How are they generating the image<br>for their daily specials? Are they going into Canva every day?<br>Yep. The sandwich shop, the, you know, all the food trucks that are posting their location, and<br>this is taking it way out of the context of a post.[01:22:00]<br>Which is where something like Canva makes more sense. Like people are doing it, generating<br>an image unto itself. Right. My friend, um, Mike has the epic food truck that makes unbelievable<br>brisket and meat filled happiness, um, out of his food truck. Um, so he has to consistently post<br>where he&#8217;s at, what are today&#8217;s specials, and this is, and I&#8217;ll post them on the local Facebook<br>groups and people go running us too.<br>So I&#8217;m like, okay, I should ask him how he&#8217;s generating and I need to think back. It&#8217;s like, is he<br>generating images? Is he upload? I kind of feel like he&#8217;s uploading the same logo every time<br>and then writing the content, but, and so is there value in all of the content being on the image?<br>I don&#8217;t know. I have to think about that.<br>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d wanna include the words [01:23:00] too, but, right. Yeah. I might have a<br>conversation with him.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah, I think that&#8217;d be great. Um, I&#8217;ll do one with, uh, Emily, see where that goes.<br>And then I, I just shared the, uh, this whiteboard with you in Slack. Great. I have a friend.<br>Thanks so much. This is, uh, this is good stuff.<br>Okay. So I got my marching orders to talk to Emily about that, see what they&#8217;re doing, see if<br>there&#8217;s ideas to like, drive the conversions that they need for post, explore some of the eBooks<br>too. I put course up here cause I think that&#8217;s another thing. Yep. But, um, yeah, I was thinking<br>that too.<br>Corey Maass: Okay. Um, yeah, and I think I&#8217;m gonna talk to, I&#8217;ve got one or two people to talk<br>to.<br>Um, and I think, I think I will try to, I, well, I, like I said earlier, like I do want to. Make sure that<br>I&#8217;m wrapping up Crop express properly. [01:24:00] Um, but then, you know, out of sheer<br>excitement, I imagine I&#8217;ll reopen the, the plugin that I&#8217;d started to build and see if I can get it<br>working enough to send it to you.</p>



<p>Okay, cool. All right.<br>Cory Miller: Thanks dude. Talk to you soon. I&#8217;ll be talking to you. Okay.</p>

<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><a href="https://twitter.com/corymiller303">Cory Miller</a> is joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/Professor">Jess Friedman</a> from <a href="https://wp.cloud/">WP Cloud</a> discuss how hosting companies can improve their infrastructure and services to provide better performance and reliability to their customers. They also dive into the importance of customer support, the benefits of using managed hosting services, the ethics of data collection, and more. The experience and expertise offered are sure to inspire you to increase your standards of service</p>



<p class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>



<ul type="video" class="wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
<li><strong>Outsourcing Infrastructure. </strong>WordPress hosting companies can benefit from outsourcing their infrastructure to specialized providers such as WP Cloud. This can free up their customer support team from dealing with infrastructure-related issues and enable them to focus on providing better customer service and value-added services.</li>



<li><strong>Increase Customer Satisfaction.</strong> By democratizing publishing and providing a superior WordPress experience, hosting companies can reduce churn and retain customers who may otherwise switch to other platforms if their WordPress experience is subpar.</li>



<li><strong>Set Up for Speed.</strong> While many factors can impact website speed, some of the most important ones include optimizing images, using a content delivery network (CDN), and minimizing the use of plugins. By focusing on these areas, WordPress agencies can help their clients improve their website speed and ultimately provide a better user experience for their visitors.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper" id="h-transcript">Transcript</h2>



<p>Cory Miller: [00:00:00] Everybody welcomed back to post status draft. I&#8217;ve got a longtime friend<br>of mine in the WordPress space. I think we met like 10 years ago, Jesse. Um, but we&#8217;re gonna<br>be talking about WP Cloud today, and this is part of our product people series. Um, I heard<br>about WP Cloud, I know Jesse and I was like, Hey, I wanna know more about WP Cloud.<br>It&#8217;s really compelling from what I&#8217;ve heard. Um, but first and foremost, welcome to the podcast.<br>Jesse. Could you tell us a little bit about your.<br>Jesse Friedman: Yeah. Thanks Corey. And yeah, it probably has been a decade. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, uh,<br>it&#8217;s awesome to, to be able to, uh, know people like you and be able to work with people like you<br>for so long.<br>Um, and that&#8217;s one of the great things about the WordPress community, right? Oh, yeah. Uh,<br>yeah. So, uh, I, I, uh, got started in WordPress, geez, back in 2005, I think. Uh, I was, uh,<br>working as a professor at a university and, uh, trying to teach, [00:01:00] uh, students, uh, well<br>actually I was a student at the time and then later I became a professor and started teaching<br>WordPress.<br>Uh, but my professor, Hillary Mason, who&#8217;s actually, used to work at Bitly and is pretty world<br>renowned, uh, data scientist. She, she turned me onto WordPress and, uh, I never looked back.<br>Uh, prior to that I was building like static websites. Um, and, uh, and WordPress, uh, is not just a<br>piece of software, right?<br>It&#8217;s a community of people that, uh, help to kind of raise the level of everyone who works on it.<br>Um, and that, that&#8217;s where I got my career jump off. It was, uh, it was definitely with WordPress<br>for sure. That&#8217;s awesome.<br>Cory Miller: Well, we met when you&#8217;re part of Brute Protect and uh, I was asking in the pre-roll<br>about your art in the background.<br>I&#8217;m a big fan of art. Yeah. I wanna get some from the walls, but tell me, tell me more about the<br>art in the background cuz I was like, Hey, we met when you were part of Brute Protect before it<br>was acquired by automatic. And you kind of pointed to the [00:02:00] lightning in the back. So,<br>yeah, tell me more.<br>Jesse Friedman: Yeah. So actually before we jump in here, this is an not an, uh, chronological<br>order, but I was actually working for a company called Astonish, uh, where I actually got to build<br>a, a, a large web team.<br>I actually still work with one colleague from that company, Jeff Kalinsky. He works at Automatic<br>now. Uh, when we were tasked with building, um, or converting a. source.net based cms, uh,<br>from an old product called Blue Squid, uh, to a new WordPress powered multi-site. And it was<br>gonna house like 4,000 sites.<br>Um, and so we, I found this at like a art show. Uh, bought it, hung it on the wall, and uh, and we<br>spent a year building this new platform. The funny thing about it, this is a really unique story.<br>Didn&#8217;t give us access to the source files. Uh, and they kind of held everything hostage. This third<br>party company that we were host, host, hosting everything with.<br>Um, so we actually had to build a, like a [00:03:00] w get scraper. To scrape our own websites<br>and convert them into WordPress themes. So we didn&#8217;t even like turn them into Ion out, we<br>turned them into full blown WordPress themes on a multisite. And, uh, we were able to move all<br>those sites over very quickly. Um, and so I asked that same artist, I said, Hey, can you paint a, a<br>harpoon now that Blue Squid is dead?<br>It&#8217;s this old product. And so we hung that up on the wall and that, and that was that. I left that<br>company and co-founded Brew Protect. Uh, brew Protect was a cloud powered. Um, Uh, botnet<br>prevention service. So like anyone who&#8217;s trying to brute force into your website, we used, uh,<br>data that we would gather from attack vectors from different various, uh, areas.<br>And it was really the first time that I was able to say like, we&#8217;re building something that leverages<br>information that we gained from multiple hosting partnerships to better the entire WordPress<br>community. Because everything that was happening before then was hosts would gather attack<br>vectors against their own infrastructure, and that was the only thing they could [00:04:00] learn<br>from.<br>But what we did was we grabbed that information from across different hosting companies, uh,<br>across customers who were around the globe, and we were able to really do a better job of</p>



<p>thwarting those attacks. Um, and so that represents cloud data raining down on a, a botnet, uh,<br>going outta business there.<br>And then, uh, yeah, and so then we got, uh, acquired by Automatic back in 2014, and I joined<br>the Jet Pack team. Uh, I&#8217;ve been working on hosting partnerships and. Product development for<br>Jet Pack for almost nine years now. And, uh, then we started, uh, you know, launched WP Cloud<br>last year.<br>Cory Miller: So it has been 10 years.<br>Because I met you all right before the automatic acquisition. Acquisition. Yeah. Yeah. Um, man,<br>well, some nostalgia there. Um, so what&#8217;s, what&#8217;s, uh, really compelling, what you just said too,<br>is Jet. So when I knew you all got required and got got to meet you and Sam [00:05:00]<br>Hotchkis, and then at some point I realized, Sam, and you were on the jet pack team and at Ithe<br>we.<br>Felt like we were competitors to Jet Pack in many ways, um, from backups and security. And I<br>was like, oh no, these, these guys are gonna take jet pack to the next level. And I&#8217;ve definitely<br>seen, I think, what is probably the product of your work over the years where it&#8217;s like, oh no.<br>Okay, Sam, Jesse getting in there, um, with Jet Pack.<br>So, uh, that&#8217;s a, I wanted to mention that cuz I&#8217;ve thought that many times. I think I&#8217;ve expressed<br>that to Sam. Um, but. Anyway, thanks for that background. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s really compelling. Back<br>to the old static h CML days. Woo. Thanks WordPress. Yeah. So Jesse, let&#8217;s talk about WP<br>Cloud. I know, um, we&#8217;ve talked a couple times about this and I, what, I know I can throw this at<br>you and you&#8217;ll, you just, you just hit it out of the part and, uh, but tell me really succinctly, what<br>do you [00:06:00] think? What is WP Cloud?.<br>Jesse Friedman: WP Cloud is a WordPress focus cloud platform that we built within automatic<br>to power the highest and most trafficked websites in the world. Um, and to provide a very unique<br>solution, uh, that gets very close to, if not a hundred percent up time. Um, and so we&#8217;re doing<br>something that&#8217;s a little bit different than what you see with other cloud platforms.<br>We provide vertical scaling and automated real-time fail. So what we want to do is provide a<br>solution that, again, is 100% WordPress focused, but allows you to stop thinking about hosting<br>altogether. You don&#8217;t have to worry about it anymore. We&#8217;re gonna take care of all the<br>infrastructure, keep it up and running, keep it high performance, and, uh, let hosting companies<br>or others focus on what they do best, um, to provide a, a fantastic experience to customer.<br>Cory Miller: Well, anytime you say something around wordpress.com infrastructure, I always<br>go, holy [00:07:00] cow. Yeah. When you can say, pretty near, I know you&#8217;re being humbled too,<br>but like that, that system is renowned because it&#8217;s incredible. I mean, people that work on, uh,<br>the platform and what it does, but. Now, who&#8217;s it? Who&#8217;s it really for?<br>When you think about WP Cloud, you kind of maybe mentioned this, but I wanna drill down on<br>that. Who do you think it&#8217;s really for?<br>Jesse Friedman: Yeah. All right. So if we look at the actual, uh, hosting, uh, platform itself, it&#8217;s<br>for anyone who wants to have high availability, high performant websites. Uh, but if we look at<br>the brand WP Cloud, what we&#8217;ve done is we&#8217;ve decided to take, um, the entire platform and, and<br>give.<br>A brand that we can then go to hosting companies with and, and provide services to hosting<br>companies. So WP Cloud is not interested in individual customers, uh, small agencies, things<br>like that. What we&#8217;re actually interested in doing is providing services to hosting companies<br>[00:08:00] to help them provide. Better hosting.<br>Um, you can think about WP Cloud as a utility service, like the electrical grid underground, uh,<br>providing services to customers all, all around the globe. But, um, allowing those hosting<br>companies to, uh, maintain their experience, the things that differentiate themselves, all of. But if<br>you&#8217;re, if you&#8217;re listening to this and you&#8217;re thinking, oh, I have one website or 10 websites and I<br>want to host them and I don&#8217;t want to have to worry about, um, downtime or, or speed issues or<br>anything like that, I would suggest going straight to one of WP Cloud&#8217;s partners, pressable, for<br>example.<br>Mm-hmm.<br>Cory Miller: So when we were prepping for this, I said, Hey, so this, this pa uh, this is<br>leveraging the.com platform, and you corrected me. Share a little bit more about that.<br>Jesse Friedman: Yeah, sure. So, uh, so what we did was we took the minds and, and the<br>people behind wordpress.com powering hundreds of millions of sites there.</p>



<p>We took the [00:09:00] same, um, experienced individuals who were helping to power some of<br>the, um, most powerful websites on v i p. Uh, we took the experience that we had from Running<br>Pressable, which is, um, like a, uh, a managed WordPress host that we, uh, use to, um, really.<br>Test and grow our own product base. And so we took all those things and we said, what, how<br>can we build a cloud platform that&#8217;s gonna service all of the needs that we have internally, um,<br>and, and provide the absolute best experience?<br>And so when we did that, we ended up launching, uh, what we called internally, uh, product<br>called Atomic, uh, and that is now powering uh, wordpress.com business and e-commerce<br>plans. Pressable News Pack. And so that was, uh, similar to like how a w s got born. You know,<br>a, uh, Amazon was an e-commerce platform that was dealing with scale issues.<br>They couldn&#8217;t compensate for [00:10:00] the amount of the influx of traffic, so they had to really<br>sit down and think about how they can rebuild their entire platform. Um, and so then that&#8217;s how<br>aw w s was born. It&#8217;s not too dissimilar from what we&#8217;re doing. We have built a platform that is<br>now powering, um, 13 billion page views.<br>Um, and, uh, with sites that are experiencing incredibly fast speed under load. Um, and, and<br>now we&#8217;re saying to ourselves like, well, we know we built something amazing here. We know<br>that it&#8217;s something that we can really give back to the community as a way to raise the bar for<br>cloud hosting across, across the board.<br>Um, and so now that, that is the, that is the effort there is we&#8217;ve powered. Internally what we<br>need to, to make sure that everything runs smoothly. So again, if anybody wants to try out WP<br>Cloud, sign up for a wordpress.com business site, sign up for pressable. Um, you&#8217;ll feel the<br>speed, [00:11:00] uh, the proof is in, in the, uh, experience right there.<br>Um, but then WP Cloud is really now focused on how it can provide services to hosting.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah. I love that I&#8217;ve observed from the industry being in as long as both of us have<br>that, you know, there was this day where you started seeing some of the really big hosting<br>companies start go moving. There WordPress stuff over to the cloud.<br>Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of bumpy roads along that way, but um, your comparison with aws for<br>instance, cuz I&#8217;ve heard Google Cloud, aws, some of those offerings kind of moving over and<br>that&#8217;s the way it feels like it&#8217;s shifting. I&#8217;m not a technical person, but I&#8217;ve been in the space a<br>long time and I go, it makes sense to have cloud-based hosting, especially for WordPress.<br>And then you get specific WordPress expertise. That knows that application better than anybody<br>I&#8217;d, I&#8217;d, I&#8217;d challenge anybody to say, do you know more about WordPress and automatic teams?<br>Yeah. Um,<br>Jesse Friedman: we definitely leveraged our, our own internal expertise to solve for that. And,<br>and you&#8217;re right. I [00:12:00] mean, you look at hosting companies and they&#8217;re trying to figure<br>out ways to differentiate themselves outside of the infrastructure.<br>A lot of them are moving to Google Cloud or aw. Um, the shared hosting is still, you know,<br>mostly the same kind of solution, um, that everyone is kind of racing to the bottom on pricing on.<br>Mm-hmm. Um, and so, so how are hosts differentiating themselves? Well, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s<br>made on top of promises of speed and performance and, and security.<br>But the reality of the situation is the, the infrastructure underneath is actually not. That different.<br>So hosting companies are really focused on trying to differentiate themselves now in the way in<br>which they market themselves. The onboarding experience that provide the partnerships that<br>they can leverage to provide a better experience to customers.<br>The speed at which you can launch your site, the customer service, those are all things that<br>HUS hosting companies really f are, are focused on, and. Frankly, the places where they can,<br>they can really win. One of the conversations I had at cloudfest, uh, which was a conference<br>that we went to, um, [00:13:00] two weeks ago, was about the power of diversity within hosting.<br>Um, and so I think that it&#8217;s really important to recognize that, especially when we&#8217;re talking about<br>WP Cloud, helping to power those hosting companies in terms of like a utility. Um, you look at<br>something like shop. And or, or w and they have these global solutions for every single, um,<br>customer across the world.<br>Um, but you know, we, we know why that&#8217;s not, uh, advantageous and why WordPress is better.<br>But one of the major advantages that WordPress has is that, um, the hosting companies can<br>define the niche that they wanna solve. They can solve problems specific for geographically<br>locations. WordPress has seeded itself into hosting companies around the globe.</p>



<p>So the solutions you get from a hosting company in let&#8217;s say the Netherlands, is completely<br>different than what you might get in Malaysia or Africa. Um, and so that&#8217;s an advantage that that<br>hosting companies have in that diversity. And so, uh, you know, if we can come [00:14:00] in<br>and try to help and provide better services at that infrastructural, Then that frees those hosting<br>companies up to think about ways in which they can differentiate themselves and provide the<br>absolute best experience to those, to those customers.<br>Cory Miller: Take care of wordPress, you got the power of WP Cloud, the.com top experience<br>and do other stuff on top that adds value for your customers. Yeah, exactly. So. I know having<br>been acquired, our company was acquired by hosting company, uh, been on the inside of that<br>and realizing how much, you know, they, they really worry all, all hosting companies about price.<br>Um, yeah. Anytime you, you know, c panel was this big conversation in the industry for a long<br>time because they started cranking at prices and everybody started fleeing because they&#8217;re like,<br>they felt held hostage. But I know every penny accounts in hosting. So Can you talk a little bit<br>about the pricing structure for WP.<br>And I know that this is still early.<br>Jesse Friedman: It is still early, and I [00:15:00] appreciate that and, uh, I probably shy away<br>from getting into the super specifics of pricing right now, but what I can tell you is this, is that the<br>way in which WP Cloud Scales is based on the number of pH p workers, uh, CPUs. Uh, and<br>storage that you want.<br>And so what we want to create are ways in which hosting companies can come in, um, and<br>create bespoke offerings to either power their managed WordPress offering now, or to start by<br>offering the higher tier hosting that they haven&#8217;t been able to offer before. If you look at most of<br>the hosting companies in the world, a lot of them cap out at a hundred bucks, 150 bucks a<br>month.<br>Um, and so then you leave, uh, the super high end. Hosting customers to, to either fend for<br>themselves with their own cloud platform to go to, uh, you know, higher, higher end managed<br>hosting. Um, or something like W P V I P. What we wanna do is be able to provide services that<br>go from that range, from, uh, 25 bucks a month to [00:16:00] $2,000 a month, um, and to be<br>able to provide consistent uptime throughout all of that.<br>So hosting companies will be able to come in and use WP. Um, and, and if they want to go with<br>a lower tier, like two PHP workers, two CPUs, this is getting super technical. That&#8217;s still built for<br>like 400,000 sustained visitors a month, uh, which is gonna compensate for, you know, most.<br>Customers that&#8217;s only gonna cost that hosting company a few bucks a month with WP Cloud.<br>Um, and then, and then it scales up from there. And since we&#8217;re talking about scaling, I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll<br>just say one thing is, is that we offer something that&#8217;s pretty unique in that we don&#8217;t, uh, we don&#8217;t<br>reserve, uh, we, we don&#8217;t have any limitations on visits. So if you take a look at other hosting<br>companies, you&#8217;ll see that they create, uh, they&#8217;ll create really robust, powerful servers.<br>And then they&#8217;ll put traffic limits on it. Mm-hmm. I&#8217;m thinking of a hosting company right now<br>[00:17:00] that has, um, a robust amount of power, uh, allows for up to 40 WordPress websites<br>and only, uh, and stops at like 400,000 visits a month. Mm-hmm. Well, if you only have 10,000<br>visits a month, you don&#8217;t need all that power anyway.<br>Uh, even if you&#8217;re not sharing it across all of those things, that&#8217;s just a waste of power. That&#8217;s a<br>Lamborghini on the, on the back of a flatbed pickup truck. You know what I mean? Like you&#8217;re<br>not taking full advantage of that. WP Cloud is gonna come in and, and basically say, uh, we&#8217;re<br>going to create bespokes solutions that are designed to house the amount of traffic that you&#8217;re,<br>or serve the amount of traffic that you&#8217;re bringing.<br>Uh, but we&#8217;re not gonna limit you on, on the amount of traffic that you have there. Um, so there<br>are no real, uh, traffic limitations with WP Cloud, unlike other hosting companies.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah, it, I don&#8217;t know all the specs, but I know enough to go when they put a traffic<br>thing, there&#8217;s something underneath that they&#8217;re trying to be careful of when they put limits and<br>things.<br>But, um, [00:18:00] so that, that&#8217;s a conversation for another well, unless you.<br>Jesse Friedman: Well, I was just gonna say that it&#8217;s a way for them to mitigate their, their, their<br>risk and their costs. Yeah. Um, but we, we have built a platform that we know can scale to any<br>amount of traffic. So, uh, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re gonna differentiate ourselves there.</p>



<p>Cory Miller: Yeah. Um, so I think you said fully managed performance security and WordPress.<br>What does that mean?<br>Jesse Friedman: It means that we&#8217;re literally gonna take care of it all for you. So in terms of<br>security, uh, it has built-in backup solutions. So it&#8217;s actually pretty unique in the way in which we<br>do backups. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re gonna touch on automated failovers soon.<br>But the way we do our backups is that we do, um, daily file backups and hourly database<br>backups, but we don&#8217;t just store that on the same box. What we do is we put it onto another data<br>center. On another box that actually has power ready so that we can switch to that if we need to.<br>We can talk about that in a second.<br>Um, but we [00:19:00] do, it comes with s ssl, it comes with, uh, TLS encryption. It comes with,<br>uh, WAF DDoS protection. I&#8217;m telling you. Like we harden the heck out of it. Yeah. Um, and then<br>in, in addition to that, we automatically build in a c. No extra cost. It has a CDN built into it. Um,<br>and it, uh, also resizes your images.<br>So you&#8217;re only serving the size of the image that you need high resolution, but you&#8217;re not serving<br>these 10 megabyte images that people upload straight from their phone to their WordPress<br>instance, right? We&#8217;re resizing it and only showing the size that you need for the device that&#8217;s<br>requesting it. Uh, we also do, uh, automated caching built in too.<br>Um, and. It&#8217;s all run by our team internally, so there is really no tweaking or configuring or<br>anything that you have to do. Um, it&#8217;s 100% fully managed outta the box. That also includes the<br>management of things like P H p, uh, database. Um, it manages, uh, WordPress core [00:20:00]<br>files, certain plug-ins. It allows for templating and staging.<br>Um, and again, we handle all of that. It&#8217;s not, these aren&#8217;t things that you&#8217;re gonna have to.<br>Cherry pick based on price or anything. It&#8217;s all 100% inclusive in the product.<br>Cory Miller: So I, you mentioned principle way earlier. I&#8217;m a paying, and I wanna say that really<br>loud and clear. I&#8217;m a paying customer principle.<br>Yeah. So I&#8217;ve seen this, the performance, all these things. And, uh, so that, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s pretty<br>awesome. But I, I wanted to push in on that because I&#8217;m a, this is my comment, not. But when<br>you say managed, you always, I always go, tell me what that really means. Yeah. Yeah. It&#8217;s like,<br>you know, the Tommy Boys, like you can slap a label on the side, but it&#8217;s, you know, what<br>actually happens inside.<br>And I think that&#8217;s one thing that differentiate, differentiates, uh, any automatic brand is it&#8217;s not a<br>label on the outside. Um, yeah. Okay. So tell me what automated realtime fellows.<br>Jesse Friedman: So we touched on this briefly, right? [00:21:00] So if we, if we back up your<br>entire site to another location and we put that back up on a box that has power, um, and you&#8217;re<br>serving traffic to one location, we can automatically detect some kind of, any kind of issue.<br>So even if there was catastrophic failure, uh, you know, a pipe got cut. Uh, the data center<br>actually you. We have tons of redundancies in terms of power and things like that, but like, let&#8217;s<br>just say like a volcano erupted or something like that, you know, something really catastrophic.<br>We can in real time redirect that traffic to another data center that already has your site live on it<br>and already has, uh, the, the power behind it.<br>So we can in real time, switch that traffic and people will not experience any downtime. And that<br>is something that is nearly impossible with other cloud platforms. It is possible, but it&#8217;s incredibly<br>expensive. And because of the scale that we operate at, uh, and the WordPress efficiency that<br>we [00:22:00] have, um, we&#8217;ve been able to, to build that into the platform.<br>Cory Miller: See, when you talked about backups earlier, it&#8217;s something to know about having<br>helped lead our product, uh, for backups. And when you said that one thing, it&#8217;s not on that<br>server. It&#8217;s somewhere else within a vast infrastructure. That&#8217;s really compelling to me because<br>we would tell customers all the time, don&#8217;t just don&#8217;t back up on that server because what&#8217;s,<br>what&#8217;s it gonna do for you when it crashes?<br>Um, so like, I love the secure, the backup feature of that. It&#8217;s not just a. A backup if something<br>happens. And this was way before all this technology existed today, but that&#8217;s how we got the<br>backup is like into our product. Is it crashed? We didn&#8217;t have, we had backups maybe on that<br>server. And literally the hard drive was like capoot.<br>And so that was our mantra. Always remote, offsite, you know, so that you can restore and. In<br>case<br>Jesse Friedman: we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve seen this, I, I&#8217;ll [00:23:00] leave hosting companies names out of<br>this, this conversation, but we&#8217;ve all seen hosting companies that have had. Catastrophic failure.</p>



<p>Um, data center fires, for example, things like that.<br>Uh, and if you&#8217;re not backing up, this is getting into like a conversation about Jet Pack two, but<br>like, if you&#8217;re not backing up your, your website offsite, you&#8217;re susceptible to that. Mm-hmm. Um,<br>and that, that can be, um, unbelievably painful. I can&#8217;t tell you how many conversations I had<br>with people who say, well, I&#8217;ll worry about security later, or I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll, you know, I don&#8217;t really care<br>about backups right now.<br>I just wanna get my site. But all the time you&#8217;re investing in that, right? You&#8217;re building your<br>website. Think about the dozens of hours of time that you&#8217;re spending tweaking all those things.<br>And if you lose that, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not just catastrophic failure for the host, it&#8217;s catastrophic failure for<br>the site owner too.<br>It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s incredibly painful and to, you know, some, some people out there have stronger will than<br>I to start all over from the beginning, but I don&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s, [00:24:00] sometimes I felt that pain<br>you left with doing.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah, I, I felt that. Yeah. Um, we were, we were scraping. We had some clients at<br>the time and scraping data from Google Cash to redo websites, and so I felt that pain.<br>Yeah. So we&#8217;ve talked about, um, the power, performance, security, all these things that are<br>baked into WP Cloud, that powers.com business, eCommerce plans. But how about the,<br>Preserving and growing the hosting experience. What are your thoughts on that? So key, key<br>client for this is our hosting companies, um, to be able to really leverage all of this for, I mean,<br>when you said utility tool, it really rang a bell for me.<br>It&#8217;s like, okay, all of this at a re, very. Reasonable price, and I know they need to talk to you<br>about all those things. But yeah, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s talk about that hosting experience a little bit. Tell me,<br>tell me your thoughts on that related to WP Club.<br>Jesse Friedman: So every single [00:25:00] host that, and I&#8217;ve worked with a lot of hosting<br>companies, every single host has a unique experience.<br>Uh, the signup flow is typically about the same, but the second that you get into that WordPress<br>instance being launched, Unique onboarding flows. You get unique sets of tools. Um, the<br>different combinations of the way in which they combine, uh, partnerships they have with<br>security or performance companies.<br>Um, And then the platform, the platform is always really unique. Um, a lot of them are built on<br>top of cPanel or Plak. I think something like 70, 80% of all hosts use that technology. Mm-hmm.<br>Um, and sometimes you feel it and sometimes you don&#8217;t. Like, there are certain hosting<br>companies that are just using cPanel.<br>It literally says cPanel and you, and you know what you&#8217;re on. But then there are other hosting<br>companies that have built a completely custom bespoke solution that&#8217;s layered on top of. No<br>matter what it is, um, that, that again is how you&#8217;re differentiating yourself. Um, so if I look at six<br>hosting companies that are using the same [00:26:00] basic boxes to do shared WordPress<br>hosting, they&#8217;re the only difference.<br>There is price, but we&#8217;re all. All hosting companies are racing to the bottom on price, and we&#8217;re,<br>we&#8217;re talking about a difference of a few bucks a month. Um, so then what is it that you get with<br>that hosting that&#8217;s really gonna differentiate &#8217;em? And so most people are either making<br>decisions based on the fact that they have a recommendation from a friend, or they&#8217;re taking a<br>look at, uh, you know, the, the, the bespoke solutions that are coming bundled with that.<br>The great thing about WP Cloud is that it has no platform. It has no user interface. It is 100%<br>API driven. So for any hosting company to use it, it has to work underneath every single thing<br>that they&#8217;ve already built. Um, and so it can work with C Panel, it can work with Plesk, uh, or it<br>can work with whatever bespoke solution you have.<br>Um, but your, um, Unveiling of the use of WP Cloud is up to you as a host and company. You<br>[00:27:00] can go one way and say, Similar to, I think like WP Engine does this with like a w s or<br>Google Cloud. They say like, you know, proudly like we&#8217;re partnered with this company to, to<br>launch this. Um, and the same way that Pressable does this with like WP Cloud or Grid Pain,<br>uh, you know, they say proudly powered by WP Cloud.<br>And that&#8217;s starting to mean something as we start to have more of these conversations and<br>more people understand what WP Cloud really is. But, um, WP Cloud also offers a completely.<br>Uh, an option that allows you to basically use our infrastructure without ever mentioning us. You<br>could even bring your own IP addresses if you wanted to, um, and then take use of the entire</p>



<p>infrastructure underneath it, uh, without having to disclose that it&#8217;s not something that&#8217;s<br>homegrown.<br>Um, so however the host and company wants to work in that, in that area makes sense to us.<br>Uh, what we want to do is just really. Allow them to refocus their efforts away from things like<br>[00:28:00] managing WordPress or handling security or dealing with uptime. The other thing I&#8217;ll<br>talk about too is, um, cost to serve.<br>Cost to serve is something that&#8217;s on the mind of every single hosting company. Uh, when<br>Pressable moved onto WP Cloud, we saw a dramatic decrease in, um, support tickets related to<br>anything infrastructure rate, limiting DDoS, anything like. Um, and the same thing with<br>wordpress.com, uh, wordpress.com business and e-commerce customers.<br>They&#8217;re not, uh, reaching out and asking for support on anything related to the box or how fast<br>their site is performing. What they are asking questions about is more things around how can<br>they be successful. How can you know what plugins should I use for this? Or, or that that&#8217;s your<br>decision as a host and company decide pr provide support in that area or not.<br>But I can tell you that when you relieve your host, your, your happiness engineers, your<br>customer service team, from the burden of having to figure out why a site is down or why it&#8217;s<br>[00:29:00] performing so slowly, it gives them the ability. You know, focus on what keeps those<br>customers there for the long term, reducing churn, which is what every host and company thinks<br>about.<br>Pressable had something like 36,000 tickets last year. Less than half of a percentage of them<br>were even associated with anything, uh, related to to infrastructure. And I even read some of<br>them. And a lot of them were just questions about how, how Pressable goes about handling.<br>Um, so we&#8217;ve basically eliminated support for, for hosting.<br>Cory Miller: That&#8217;s the headline right there for, for WordPress hosting that, that&#8217;s the headline of<br>the interview today. For sure. Well, um, Jesse, we&#8217;ve covered a lot, but I wanna make sure we<br>didn&#8217;t miss anything. Um, I think it&#8217;s an incredibly compelling service. Could help really raise the<br>standard of the hosting industry for WordPress.<br>Um, that&#8217;s exactly. So what, uh, [00:30:00] and, and this is the note I wanted to say about the<br>hosting experiences like that, uh, I think that frees a hosting company to also innovate on that<br>application labor. What things, whether it&#8217;s plugins, themes, services on top that add value for<br>who their customers are and what they&#8217;re trying to get.<br>And I think that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s pretty dang cool. If I were in that seat hosting product, uh, manager, I&#8217;d<br>be like, okay, this is taken care of. It&#8217;s base lever, le level here. Now how can we set ourselves<br>apart by adding value to who our customers are? But is there anything with that, um, we left at,<br>or you wanna mention?<br>Jesse Friedman: Well, I&#8217;ll actually just pick up right there where you, uh, you mentioned about,<br>uh, hosting companies. I think one thing to remember is, is that, Our mission at Automatic more<br>than anything is to provide, um, and democratize publishing. We know that, but it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s also<br>about making sure that WordPress is not only [00:31:00] readily available, but performing at a<br>level that, um, allows you to focus on getting the word out about your business or your political<br>views or whatever it might be.<br>Um, but hosting companies, uh, are experiencing incredible churn right now. Uh, we. This was<br>like the number one topic at that conference I mentioned earlier. Cloud Fest, um, hosting<br>companies are seeing extreme churn, and the problem is, is that when someone churns from a<br>hosting company that is specifically for WordPress, they don&#8217;t churn and go, they don&#8217;t try<br>hosting company a.<br>Say, oh, my WordPress experience wasn&#8217;t so great there. I&#8217;m gonna go try hosting company B<br>and try WordPress there, and then I&#8217;m gonna try hosting company C and try WordPress there.<br>That&#8217;s not really What happens is that they give WordPress a shot on whatever hosting<br>company they&#8217;ve chosen. And if that fails, uh, or that doesn&#8217;t work out for them, a lot of them<br>end up going to something else.<br>And so that one opportunity to provide a [00:32:00] superior WordPress experience is really<br>where we want to help, right? So if we can take care of the, the infrastructure, the hosting, the<br>security, the performance, and make sure that everyone has this like level set, amazing hosting<br>experience in terms of the infrastructure.<br>I wanna touch on the exact, like, I wanna reiterate what you just said, which is that that allows<br>hosting companies to innovate on what they can do to provide better onboarding, reduce time to</p>



<p>live, which is how fast they can launch their site, helping to make sure customers are<br>successful, focus your time on marketing so that customers sites, once they&#8217;re launched, they<br>can actually gain traffic and, and really help them to achieve their business goals.<br>And the other thing that I just wanted to touch on real quick too is, is just, uh, we talked a little bit<br>about scaling, but one of the things I do wanna mention is, is that, um, so these are bare metal<br>boxes that we built up that we own. They&#8217;re, we&#8217;re not outsourcing anything at all. Um, and we<br>have 28 data centers around the globe already that are ours, uh, powering this entire<br>infrastructure.<br>[00:33:00] Um, and then, uh, when someone. Hit with traffic, an extreme amount of traffic. What<br>typically happens with other, um, cloud platforms is that they replicate everything onto a<br>separate box and they try to throw additional boxes at the problem. But the problem is that if<br>you&#8217;re down, because you can&#8217;t service the amount of traffic that you&#8217;re handling, you have to<br>wait for that extra box to spool up, or you&#8217;re paying for it to be laying in weight.<br>Right. What we can do actually is what we do is vertical scaling. So we have the option to throw<br>more PHPs and more CPUs at the problem until we&#8217;ve compensated for the amount of traffic<br>that you have. But this is where things get really unique. We go when we build out hosting<br>plans. As I said before, hosts can build plans between two and say 30 PHP workers and CPUs.<br>That&#8217;s built for sustained traffic of 400,000 visits to 15 million visits. Um, but now let&#8217;s say you<br>have an e-commerce website that got featured on the wire cutter, or you have, uh, a product<br>that you&#8217;ve been [00:34:00] ready to release and you have a huge wait list, uh, and everyone&#8217;s<br>gonna slam your site at the same exact time.<br>WP Cloud has a very unique opportunity that we can burst to 110 PhD P workers in CPUs. And<br>then what we&#8217;re talking about then is, is handling the type of traffic that like the Washington Post<br>gets when they release an article about what&#8217;s happening in our, in our government, or. C n n<br>traffic, you know what I mean?<br>Mm-hmm. Um, and so those, those are the types of things that we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re mainly focused on<br>so that we can provide, you know, v i p level hosting, um, and allow hosting companies to break<br>out of that shared hosting and the cheaper managed hosting, and to really offer something to,<br>you know, to any of those customers that are, that are experiencing incredibly high.<br>Cory Miller: I wanna go back to something you said because I absolutely, it rings true with me,<br>is that if the hosting experience is not good, particularly on the WordPress as an application<br>layer, [00:35:00] um, yeah, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re not, we&#8217;re doing a disservice to the entire industry<br>because we&#8217;re. Turning a WordPress person into another Com competitor.<br>And you know, I&#8217;ve been in this space a long time and I go, you know, I woke up a year ago and<br>go, wow, there&#8217;s very solid competitors to WordPress now out there. And if we want to, as the<br>business eco ecosystem of WordPress continued to have this incredible thriving grow.<br>Ecosystem and the software. Then we, you know, we used to say like, you need two things.<br>You need a domain name and you need WordPress hosting to Yep. To buy our products. And<br>then again to those agencies out there who we serve, um, at post tennis and are building on<br>that, that love, that inflow and growth that we&#8217;ve all enjoyed with the growth of WordPress, then<br>we need to be serious about this conversation in the hosting experience because, You hit it right<br>on the nail.<br>They&#8217;re not leaving the hosting [00:36:00] company. Just the hosting company. They&#8217;re leaving<br>potentially WordPress. And that&#8217;s the bell I want to keep ringing, is that as an industry, we need<br>to do things like this. This is, this is a key pillar. I think. Um, there&#8217;s other things that we need to<br>be doing as a WordPress business ecosystem to keep this healthy, thriving, growing.<br>And, uh, I&#8217;m glad you mentioned that because it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve seen, um, too, but that just<br>gives a real world experience of like, if these hosting companies are having churn, it&#8217;s not just<br>them, it&#8217;s all of us. And there, there&#8217;s a brand that we&#8217;ve had with WordPress that has been<br>awesome and I&#8217;m incredibly grateful for the brand and the open source software.<br>So I appreciate you mentioning that .<br>Jesse Friedman: Yeah, of course. Yeah. If you remember the old days of the five minute install,<br>um, I do. That was basically, uh, yeah. And for anyone who&#8217;s listening, who, who may not be<br>familiar with that, cuz it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s been enough years now. Uh, when you used to get a, [00:37:00] a,<br>a new hosting account, it never really came pre-built with WordPress, uh, out of the box, you&#8217;d<br>have to.</p>



<p>Download WordPress from wordpress.org, re-upload it, sftp, build a database. Um, and then the<br>five minute install came out and it was like this brilliant way of like launching a WordPress<br>website super fast. And that was the moment I think that husband companies decided like, wait<br>a minute, we can actually like really create custom WordPress experiences.<br>Because it&#8217;s no longer in charge of the customer to actually launch a WordPress website. It&#8217;s<br>now up to the, the host to actually launch that instance. And that&#8217;s when they started packaging<br>their own plugins, their own themes into it, providing their own unique solutions. And that&#8217;s all<br>well and good. Um, but I think there is a responsibility to those hosts, to the larger ecosystem to<br>make sure that we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re furthering the mission across the board.<br>Um, and so their churn is definitely a reflection of the larger ecosystems. Hundred percent.<br>Cory Miller: I mean, that affects all of our members that post us from product companies,<br>[00:38:00] professionals that do WordPress love, being able to do pre WordPress as their career<br>and the agency serving their clients out. Across the world.<br>So a hundred percent agree. And this, this is something we&#8217;ll have to change the headline a little<br>bit and add to it because it&#8217;s my personal viewpoint that we need to, all of us collectively look at<br>the industry and go, what makes it healthier for everybody? And this is a, this is part of the<br>conversation, so it matters, this conversation today, even if they don&#8217;t choose to go with WP<br>Cloud, that we need to be thinking about this experience for the overall health of, of the industry.<br>Yeah. Absolut. For sure, Jesse, my friend. Um, so if somebody&#8217;s interested and wants to talk<br>more about W Cloud, what do they do?<br>Jesse Friedman: So if you&#8217;re a hosting company and uh, you wanna partner with WP Cloud, go<br>to wp.cloud. Uh, it&#8217;ll load so fast, you think it&#8217;s a local site. Uh, so that&#8217;ll be your first taste of the<br>power of WP Cloud.<br>Uh, funny [00:39:00] enough, that site is actually hosted by Pressable on just a regular account.<br>Nothing special. Um, so, uh, you&#8217;ll see, you&#8217;ll see how that works if you&#8217;re thinking. Moving your<br>own personal sites or your businesses sites, um, and you&#8217;re not a hosting company, but you<br>want to, you want to try out WP Cloud, take a look at our partners.<br>So we have, uh, wordpress.com Pressable, uh, if you&#8217;re a news site, you could try News Pack<br>Grid Pain now offers, um, uh, WP Cloud as well. And, uh, and uh, yeah, we have some other<br>partners coming down the pike too. Uh, that will be, uh, will be.<br>Cory Miller: Let me know when the new<br>partners come in. We wanna share that, um, to, to our members at Postes.<br>But Jesse, thanks. Sure. Uh, for this today. I appreciate your time sharing about what you&#8217;re<br>doing at WP Cloud and Automatic. Um, so thank you and everybody else. Thank you for<br>listening in to another post status draft episode I, the product People series.<br>Jesse Friedman: Yeah. Well, thank you for having me. I really appreciate it.[00:40:00]</p>

<p><a href="#h-transcript">Transcript</a> ↓</p>



<p>In this episode, <a href="https://twitter.com/corymiller303">Cory Miller</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/coreymaass">Corey Maass</a> share their insights and experience about the challenges of finding the right balance between simplicity and complexity and the importance of testing and documentation. They also share their personal stories of how they got started with WordPress and how their experiences have shaped their approach to plugin development. For anyone interested in developing WordPress plugins, especially if you are looking to improve your development process and create more user-friendly plugins, this episode is a must-listen.</p>



<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Building a successful plugin requires a deep understanding of user needs and pain points: </strong>Understanding your users&#8217; needs and pain points to develop a plugin that solves their problems effectively is critical. This requires continuous user testing and feedback to improve functionality and user experience.</li>



<li><strong>Collaboration and communication are crucial for plugin development: </strong>Plugin development is a team effort that requires effective communication, collaboration, and project management. Clear communication channels, regular meetings, and shared project management tools help ensure everyone is on the same page.</li>



<li><strong>Monetization strategies should align with user value: </strong>Considering various monetization strategies for plugins, including premium features, subscriptions, and sponsorships, is helpful. Your chosen strategy should align with the user&#8217;s value proposition and offer a fair exchange of value. Being transparent with users about the plugin&#8217;s monetization strategy and how it impacts their experience is important for successful adoption.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Session 9 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> [00:00:00] So we&#8217;ll also, um, so re read me as the, the big one?&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. I think that&#8217;s what we cover today.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. So we&#8217;ll also, uh, okay. All right. Could you hear me?&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Uh, first I can, yeah. Oh, okay. The echo you mean? Yeah. Yeah. The same thing. Mute it. Yeah. Open up YouTube and then close YouTube. But I, I keep the comments open if anybody&#8217;s weighing in.<br></p>



<p>Yeah,&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> exactly.<br></p>



<p>All right, Corey, this is session nine and we talked last week and we made the decision that we&#8217;re gonna be one this with a couple change. And call it good for now and move on to another [00:01:00] project, um, let it sit and simmer a little bit. Um, so any thoughts that you had based on last week or anything else?<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, I, I guess I just, I, I&#8217;m glad that we&#8217;re doing this, like I, and, and if for the, for the, the six people watching, You know, but hi, in historically this will be significant. You know, this is where we, uh, figured out how to make our millions. Right. Um, right. But I, I have had a lot of success not in a, in a project sense in the past of letting things.<br></p>



<p>Uh, and so I definitely like, cuz we could keep banging away at Crop Express, adding more features. And there&#8217;s still a few things that I wanna add. Like, I definitely wanna put a bow on it. Um, and I definitely think that it&#8217;s something for [00:02:00] us to talk about, promote, you know, we&#8217;ll send copies to, um, blogs.<br></p>



<p>Like let&#8217;s still have some of those conversations that, um, you talked about. As much because I want to talk to those people. I think it&#8217;d be fun. Um, but I also think that it takes the pressure off of us like, you know, Having this, having this thing and going, okay, what, what&#8217;s happening with it today?<br></p>



<p>What&#8217;s hap when Sometimes you just honestly need some time to go by. Um, and some people to mess with it and some people do mess with it enough to say, oh man, I wish it did this. And then, and then still ha use it for two more days before they finally do send us an email that&#8217;s like, okay, hey, I&#8217;ve been thinking about this for a couple of days.<br></p>



<p>Boy, I wish it did this, you know? Just because we&#8217;re thinking a lot about it doesn&#8217;t mean anybody else&#8217;s.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. And I think there&#8217;s two things when you&#8217;re saying that came to mind is the get something [00:03:00] out, sit on it a bit, let it just kind of cook or just kind of be Yeah. I think it&#8217;s interesting. And then, um, is, is great for this.<br></p>



<p>And then second is.<br></p>



<p>I forgot what I was gonna say. Um, but the second is we have the feedback loop, right. Um, within the plugin. So, you know, we, we never know. Um, might be something I think we, we felt like there was something. Better to chase that. We discovered through this, which I look at product as discovery, you know, especially our product, you know, when you got a working product and you&#8217;re just adding things, that&#8217;s way easier.<br></p>



<p>Um, working product, meaning people are paying money for it in my mind. Um, we already know it&#8217;s functional and works. Um, but yeah, and I think, you know, just to talk about our decision for a second, we saw. More [00:04:00] opportunity on another direction that we discovered something you&#8217;d been working on in parallel.<br></p>



<p>Um, we&#8217;re not ready to talk about that just yet cause we wanna get some things going, but I think that&#8217;s part of the product trail is, you know, discovery, what&#8217;s over the next mountain. And I don&#8217;t know about you, but I go, I gotta put multiple things in the. To see what actually hits. Oh, yeah. Um, I, I feel like you and I built enough of a case for the other thing that, um, is really interesting.<br></p>



<p>It seems like there&#8217;s something there. So coming back to the cycle of like, okay, we&#8217;d like this. We think this would be good. Mm-hmm. Other people, you know, would help. Um, anyway, I don&#8217;t wanna get off on that for a second, but I did wanna at least unpack a little bit of our decision. You know, Colin v1 with a couple of these tweaks, um, good.<br></p>



<p>And all that, and say, it&#8217;s always a safari. Yes. [00:05:00]&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. And I, you know, I, it&#8217;s an ongoing conversation, I think is the other good metaphor. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s literal for, in our case, but it&#8217;s also a good metaphor that as you talk, you uncover more things. You go, oh, I didn&#8217;t think about this. And it&#8217;s, um, so I guess the analogy too is, Concepts have to simmer.<br></p>



<p>Ideas have to simmer, you know, the cadence of you and I chatting once a week, you know, occasionally a little bit more, but, uh, gives us a chance to go, okay, so this happened this week where this new other thing came out this week where this new, um, you know, product caught my eye that isn&#8217;t related, but it sparked an idea, dot, dot, dot.<br></p>



<p>Like it&#8217;s, you know, trying to, trying to get it all done, you know, hackathon. Is a neat exercise, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the, the true arc of, of most products journeys. So, um, but I definitely, [00:06:00] oh, the one thing that I didn&#8217;t tell you about is I did get my first email from crop.express, the website of somebody asking specifically, I have a client website, they need the image to be exactly these pixel proportions.<br></p>



<p>So not even an aspect ratio. And uh, I was like, oh, okay. You know, so I think that I, I want to think about again, as we&#8217;re talking about sort of putting a bow on v1 uh, accounting for that situation, and then to me that kind of, again, we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve completed a. Product. It solves the problem. It solves the problem everywhere that we think that it matters.<br></p>



<p>Um, it solves the problem for all of the scenarios that we currently know about. And this is where, like you said, we&#8217;re wait, waiting for feedback. We&#8217;re waiting for people to say, oh, hey, you know, aspect ratio [00:07:00] isn&#8217;t really what I need, but I need is image or is pixel size. Uh, which technically can be done in the, I had added bin and max pixel stuff.<br></p>



<p>Like I, I think, you know, kind of like your feedback last week, like this settings page is the advanced settings, or it feels, you know, um, it feels like a 200 level class or whatever. Um, And so, you know, looking at simplifying that, but then, uh, yeah, letting it, letting it ride. Um, and, and at that point, like I said, I&#8217;m really excited about getting it at actually installing it onto my client&#8217;s websites and going, all right, Guinea pigs dance.<br></p>



<p>You now have to use my plugin. But I&#8217;ve, even, this week it came up again where, um, one of my clients was like, you know, trying to, trying to get an image. Onto the site correctly. And I had to walk her through some stuff. It&#8217;s like, don&#8217;t mention the plugin yet. Don&#8217;t mention the [00:08:00] plugin yet, but as soon as I introduce it and walk them through it, you know, so I think it&#8217;ll solve problems for them.<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, a absolutely. Um, it, this whole conversation, and this relates to crop express now,<br></p>



<p>uh, made me think of. But also kudos for like a, you, you saw an opportunity there with your client, like, so that&#8217;s like the validation of, you know, is this, is this a valuable thing? Mm-hmm. You&#8217;ve seen this a bunch of times where I wanted to share for anybody that&#8217;s listened later is I always come back to this, so it seems like, like I&#8217;ve majored in the pains.<br></p>



<p>Um, specifically with utility software in the past. The thing that&#8217;s really always compelling to me is gains. And I know you worked at O Opt Montreal at one point and I go, that was my classic example. We did utility things that [00:09:00] I themes and you know, you look at the gain, you look at like an e-commerce site or something, a marketing software or something like that, and it&#8217;s like that&#8217;s, I haven&#8217;t really camped.<br></p>



<p>Had a product. I don&#8217;t think that camps out in the gain side. Yeah. Um, but I think we&#8217;ve been doing this work too, is coming back to who is our customer for this. Mm-hmm. Whether it&#8217;s ourselves for sure. And then we&#8217;re developing out the profile for there. Like could this be something that&#8217;s something when we start and talk about the next project publicly, um, so that we can, that&#8217;s something I want to do better is go, okay, let&#8217;s identify.<br></p>



<p>The person that might have this problem or frustration or issue. This is a whole concept I&#8217;m trying to get to. What&#8217;s the amount of pain? Somebody goes, I&#8217;ll pay for it. What&#8217;s the amount of gain? Somebody goes, I&#8217;ll pay for it. You know? Yep. That&#8217;s [00:10:00] some of my learning as I&#8217;ve gone, is gone. Okay. Like when we created backup buddy.<br></p>



<p>Um, the de the developer goes, Hey, I think we should, WordPress needs a holistic backup solution. And I was like, I just go, yeah, because a hundred percent theoretical market at that time. Um, so it&#8217;s pretty easy. I think WordPress has got enough things out there. It&#8217;s interesting from a competitive standpoint is where&#8217;s that ideal place?<br></p>



<p>So, I don&#8217;t know, I wanna throw some of that up to you and see if you had any comments. Cause you always have something really help. Uh, that changes my perspective a little bit, but it&#8217;s like this balance, this is a formula for how products and services, different things get up and then, you know, nailing that customer, they go, oh man, that, that would, you know, when you get that feeling of like, oh, this would help me so much.<br></p>



<p>That&#8217;s the magic right there. Yeah.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> And. [00:11:00] I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m definitely, I&#8217;ve also had some similar thoughts in that it&#8217;s, it is a, I think, a slightly different way of thinking about product. Right. And the looking for pain is a very popular, um, Hundred level, I guess. Apparently I&#8217;m making college analogies today. Um, but like you look at, um, Amy Hoy, Justin Jackson, uh, Rob Walling, like the, the startup thought leaders, um, who put out a lot of great content and have done for decades.<br></p>



<p>Arguably, um, the, the thinking for a long time has been okay. You are an aspir. Probably solopreneur. You are a entrepreneur, and I don&#8217;t mean that negatively, but the, like you are an aspiring, uh, you, you have an entrepreneurial spirit without [00:12:00] experience, right? So you, you&#8217;re, you want to start your entrepreneur journey.<br></p>



<p>Um, and, uh, a very popular formula to start with because honestly, I think. I know it&#8217;s generally more reliable as a beginner, um, is pain. And so there&#8217;s all these ideas about like, okay, you get on a forum for fishermen where all the fishermen are talking and you kind of listen to their conversations and, and when they keep talking about like, boy at dawn I wish I had, you know, a certain kind of light.<br></p>



<p>And that&#8217;s where you go, ah, That&#8217;s a pain. Now I can go try to solve it. Um, which is very different from, oh, I&#8217;m now, I&#8217;m blanking on the name. Um, but there was, um, a product that came out years ago and it just [00:13:00] popped up on my radar again. Oh, Prezi. P r e z I. Mm-hmm. I think, right?&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Mm-hmm. Yeah. I remember Prezi,&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> that was a hundred percent a solution, looking for a.<br></p>



<p>It was a really neat, in, in, I mean, we still have the slides paradigm, the, you know, uh, PowerPoint, Google presentation paradigm, rectangle, rectangle, rectangle. And Prezi had this really neat software that they built online, which was very impressive at the time, cuz again, it was probably 10 years ago, but where you had a, it was kind of like a, an interactive mind map.<br></p>



<p>And so you had a point that had something. Concept off of it. And you&#8217;d zoom around, you&#8217;d sort of fly around this, this presentation and it was extremely novel. But I think every person built one presentation in it and was like, this is neat, but it&#8217;s very clear that I&#8217;m using this software cuz it does one thing.<br></p>



<p>Um, and they did a really good [00:14:00] job, I think, of marketing and finding a use for this and marketing it, but they. Couldn&#8217;t become the presentation standard that they&#8217;d hoped to because they changed. It was too specific, you know? Um, and that&#8217;s always the fear. It&#8217;s definitely more fun sometimes. Um, and I&#8217;ve definitely built a lot of products that were a concept and it was like, oh, I think I have a different way of approaching.<br></p>



<p>Uh, you know, project management to-do lists, time tracking the standard paradigms, but like, uh, instead of it being a vertical list, you know, it&#8217;s horizontal or whatever the, whatever, it&#8217;s, um, and I think that it&#8217;s you, it&#8217;s then tough because if you&#8217;re, if you&#8217;re on one end of the spectrum, you can, you can only present gain.<br></p>



<p>Like Prezi, where it&#8217;s a, where it&#8217;s, I hate to use the word gimmick, [00:15:00] but where it&#8217;s, again, a, a prob a solution looking for a problem that&#8217;s dangerous, that&#8217;s very, very difficult to change a paradigm. Like they did not change the way all presentations are. Look, they couldn&#8217;t. Um, and then on the other end of the spectrum, you know, what we&#8217;ve, what we&#8217;ve talking about is, um, a hundred percent solving for a pain.<br></p>



<p>It&#8217;s. Fishermen need a flashlight at dawn, build the flashlight. You&#8217;re done. And so what we start talking about is somewhere in the middle. Um, and it&#8217;s, and it, again, I think just a different way of, of thinking, uh, it&#8217;s gonna be more challenging for you, marketing it, more challenging for both of us or anybody to talk about it.<br></p>



<p>Um, if it isn&#8217;t a problem that people are already trying to solve. And I think what we&#8217;re, you know, I do, I do anticipate landing [00:16:00] somewhere in the middle, like crop Express I think is a good example of, it&#8217;s definitely a pain, but people are solving it by going elsewhere. They&#8217;re going to Photoshop, they&#8217;re going to crop.express, and we&#8217;re kind of bringing it to them.<br></p>



<p>Um, and so I think that I, I hope to still kind of do some of that stuff. Um, but then also, You know, maybe introduce concepts that, that WordPress doesn&#8217;t currently have, paradigms that, that WordPress doesn&#8217;t currently, uh, have its arms around. And so I&#8217;m kinda excited for all that. It&#8217;s also, I think it being more on that spectrum, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s more creative.<br></p>



<p>It&#8217;s more fun for us.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. So yeah, a absolutely. You know, we, it seems like we&#8217;re using that whole thing is build something for yourself. And we&#8217;re using problems we see for ourselves using the new [00:17:00] thing we&#8217;re talking about, using word pr, um, post status and your clients and things. And it makes me think like the game pain conversation on that when we show that we can.<br></p>



<p>What I wrote down when, when we, just a minute ago was, you know, in the classic consulting bible, I think it&#8217;s Alan Weiss, he talks about the job of a consultant is to improve the client&#8217;s condition. Mm-hmm. In some way. Mm-hmm. And I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of thoughts about consulting cause I&#8217;ve tried it a couple of times and, uh, have failed miserably at it.<br></p>



<p>But, uh, I&#8217;m still trying. And, but from the. From that consulting thing. If you think about that just for a second, you&#8217;re like, how do I help improve the client&#8217;s condition, or in this case, our potential customer&#8217;s condition? And I think we&#8217;ve done a lot of that work in Crop Express is precisely thinking about the outcome they&#8217;re wanting.[00:18:00]&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>And, uh, I&#8217;ll save the rest for our, for our next conversation. But, um, so I. Anything you learned, and I know we still need to do the readme, but, um, anything takeaways from what we&#8217;ve done so far? Other takeaways?<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I, in a, to be honest, I do think that we have, I&#8217;m thinking out loud here, so I, I, I reserve the right to take all of this back. Um, but at least some. The process that we&#8217;re going through, have gone through is the same, uh, falls in the same trap in that I do think that we have, we know there&#8217;s a problem. We, we&#8217;ve had the problem.<br></p>



<p>We don&#8217;t like how, um, propping and inserting images into WordPress currently [00:19:00] works. Um, we. Got excited and said, okay, there&#8217;s something here. We both felt, you know, felt it in our gut, but then as we got into it, there&#8217;s definitely been, I don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s not like I expect, you know, a million news, a million installs overnight.<br></p>



<p>Um, but there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s something, I don&#8217;t know what we could have done differently, but they&#8217;re, I haven&#8217;t felt. The spark didn&#8217;t ignite, I guess is what I&#8217;m, kinda what I would say. It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s something here. We&#8217;ve built a nice little utility. I almost, it almost feels like we&#8217;ve kind of, uh, you know, we, we saw a sparkle of something on the ground.<br></p>



<p>We started digging. There might have been a couple of other glimmers of like, oh, there&#8217;s a, maybe a li a hint of gold. It kept us digging, but I kind of feel like we&#8217;ve reached a point where, You know, we&#8217;ve dug around, we&#8217;ve dug up all the earth around what we thought might have been a vein of gold and said, okay, [00:20:00] yeah, no, I guess there&#8217;s nothing here.<br></p>



<p>Um, and not that that isn&#8217;t part of the process. Um, I don&#8217;t know what we could have done differently. I, I only question if there was a way to have arrived there sooner. Um, mm-hmm. And again, none of this is to say that I don&#8217;t think that what we&#8217;ve created has value. Um, and we kept sort of going, okay, well let&#8217;s, you know, we keep having really good high level conversations, which again, has led to other ideas.<br></p>



<p>Um, and so that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s not invaluable. Um, but we were sort of like, take a step forward and see, take a step forward and see. And now that we&#8217;re ready to kind of put a bow on version one, it&#8217;s like, yeah, this might be. You know, which is okay. Um, but it&#8217;s very, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s definitely a little hard to accept.<br></p>



<p>Do you know what I mean? Like just [00:21:00] the sunk cost fallacy or whatever it is. Like you Yeah. We&#8217;ve put in time and effort and, and so much thinking that we, we, part of me still really wants it to be something more than what it may. You know, and I know, and this, this conversation may be just as in, um, as premature as, uh, as what I&#8217;m alluding to, right.<br></p>



<p>Of like, early on we were very optimistic that we would find something bigger down the road anyway. So I have a thought&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I, on that thought. I have, I have a thought for when we go to the next conversation. Hmm. Um, how we could maybe approach that even better.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> But I guess I like what I do like is the meta, um, the meta of you and I recording all of these conversations.<br></p>



<p>Right. And I think, like, I remember one, one of the, a a, a mental image, but a [00:22:00] conversation, a memory that, that often pops into my head is when I still worked at we. Um, yes, the one that&#8217;s in the documentary, you can see my bald spot in, in the back of some of the shots, um, where they talk about, you know, the demise of, of WeWork.<br></p>



<p>Um, so yeah, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m WeWork famous. Um, but, uh, at the time I sat at the table with, uh, five other entrepreneurs, everybody pursuing different projects and it was great because it was an an instant mastermind and very frequently we. Just say, Hey, could I, you know, buy you lunch and, and pick your brain about such and such?<br></p>



<p>And I remember a buddy of mine, Joel, coming to a real crossroads in, uh, in product and in business. Um, and again, him saying, Hey, could I just, could we take a walk? I&#8217;m like, you know, vexed about this and [00:23:00] we. Uh, in soho and we walked over to the river and just like standing at the railing and looking at, um, what, what would it have been, um, the Hudson River and looking over to New Jersey and him talking.<br></p>



<p>And there was this moment of me just feeling very, this is, this is feeling very grown up and very, like, we were having important conversations and, um, You know, and it, it felt great that I hopefully was helping him work through some problems and stuff. But, um, anyway, uh, the value in that experience, that camaraderie and, and then ultimately, like there were other conversations where he helped me just as much as maybe I helped him.<br></p>



<p>Um, but I&#8217;m hoping that at a high level, even though you and I like session seven, whatever this is, we, we are where we are. It is where it isn&#8217;t, where we expect it to. We are going to continue, but I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m hoping that people watching this are having some of that same, like, [00:24:00] oh, other people have these, these thoughts or go around in these circles or, you know, ramble to themselves just like I do&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> now.<br></p>



<p>I, I think so many times, uh, I&#8217;m not just, I don&#8217;t wake up born with a gift of know. What the pro products are. Um, I&#8217;ve gotta figure it out.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Ands am working with you, man. I know. I, I was counting on million dollar idea overnight, the magic.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um, you know, and uh, so I&#8217;ve done a lot of thinking about products for the last 15 years, obviously, and gone.<br></p>



<p>Okay. You get, so I think we&#8217;re pulling together some components, comparing experiences too, and. Plowing the new head forward. Um, so yeah, I mean, the camaraderie&#8217;s been amazing. I do it just for that. But second is I think we&#8217;re building some experience about what products work, what, what products don&#8217;t. I, I think there&#8217;s a tendency for me is think [00:25:00] people do have magic and just know it, but there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot of things that go into that.<br></p>



<p>Yeah. And there&#8217;s a lot of. Professionally about this particular topic, but there&#8217;s a reason why comp big companies buy smaller companies because they found the magic and they were pulled in, you know, kind of thing. Um, at least that&#8217;s how I think about it in my humility.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Well, and so I, in the last few years have learned to make things around my house.<br></p>



<p>I. My carpentry skills are getting better. I&#8217;m not good. But, uh, I have now, you know, built a big roof over my patio. I&#8217;ve built shelves, I&#8217;ve, you know, um, helped my father-in-law fix his roof, stuff like that. Um, and I&#8217;m, I&#8217;ve definitely had the experience where I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m working generally with people who know what they&#8217;re.<br></p>



<p>But not always. [00:26:00] Uh, I have, I can always jump on YouTube and, and Google things. Um, but I definitely felt the, so a little, a little insight to me like. Years and years ago, I was an artistic genius. Um, in my own mind, absolutely. Like I was, uh, a musician. I still am. I was starting to build product. I still do, but at the time I was convi, utterly convinced that I&#8217;m very smart and I will, I can, I can figure out magic, um, and, uh, an aspect.<br></p>



<p>Turning middle-aged or whatever it is, is like, I&#8217;m just another human. And yes, I might do some amazing things. Um, but most humans in one sense or another, do some amazing things. Um, but everybody also, everybody has to start from somewhere. And a lot of the times it&#8217;s a group of people. And so, uh, going back to like learning how to repair or I, I got to be, [00:27:00] I was, uh, helped a bunch of people literally build a house in a.<br></p>



<p>And it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. And the, the, the, in the crew, it was a dad and some son, his sons all work construction, all build houses, so they know how to knock together, literally knock together a house in a day. And I had no idea how to knock together a house in a day. Um, And so they are amazing at what they do now from experience, and they are smart people.<br></p>



<p>Um, and then that gets shared with the rest of us. There&#8217;s this trickle down, and I&#8217;m not saying I could go build a house in a day, but at least I have some sense of how it is done. And so this summer when I build a shed, I might be able to build a shed with a couple of other people in a couple of days.<br></p>



<p>You know what I mean? Mm-hmm. Um, and so there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s definitely. You know, we, we always talk about the Steve [00:28:00] Jobs or the whoever, um, you know, the artistic geniuses. The, the people who can snap their fingers and, and creativity comes out, and then the rest of us have to work at it, you know? And, and that&#8217;s okay.<br></p>



<p>And it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a little bit of luck and it&#8217;s a little bit of timing and it&#8217;s a little bit of the people around you, and it&#8217;s a little bit of the industry you&#8217;re in. And then it&#8217;s the practice that you&#8217;ve done. And you and I have both been thinking about product for, you know, 15 years or whatever it is.<br></p>



<p>And so I&#8217;m walking around, I&#8217;m in San Francisco this week, so I&#8217;m walking around in San Francisco thinking, The amount of, you know, tech and, and whatnot that&#8217;s here. Um, but what it really comes down to is like, I was driving on the highway last night. Judging harshly, all of the ridiculous billboards, because I&#8217;m like, who is Twilio think they&#8217;re advertising to?<br></p>



<p>Or who is, um, who else did we see monday.com? And I&#8217;m not necessarily picking on their billboards. They&#8217;re fine. But it&#8217;s like, [00:29:00] okay, th this is, these, these is, this isn&#8217;t, that&#8217;s most of these products I don&#8217;t think. Attributable to one person&#8217;s genius. These are products that were built by teams and companies that were built up over time.<br></p>



<p>And then there&#8217;s a marketing team, and now I&#8217;m questioning some of the marketing decisions, but I&#8217;m like, who are they marketing to? You know? And how does that differ from like the online billboards ads and such that I&#8217;m seeing when I&#8217;m in New Hampshire versus in. You know, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m essentially in Silicon Valley, you know, so it&#8217;s, uh, humbling, right?<br></p>



<p>I mean, they&#8217;re exp spending tens of thousands on billboards that I think are not very good. Um, but at the same time, they&#8217;ve arrived there over time, you know? And did it start with conversations like this? Did it, you know, who was the team involved? Who were the people involved? What were their experience?<br></p>



<p>I think that&#8217;s all fascinating. I wish most [00:30:00] companies. There was just a, a thread on Hacker News. Um, was it Hack News or Reddit? Like what are your favorite postmortems? Um, and it&#8217;s, I, I like the people on that thread were wishing that they were more write-ups of, um, You know, there&#8217;s probably a little bit of morbid curiosity, um, but also like, you know, what are the lessons we can learn, but also a, a lot of it&#8217;s just the stories are fascinating.<br></p>



<p>There&#8217;s a reason why there&#8217;s 101 podcasts interviewing founders, many of whom haven&#8217;t reached the success that most of us would, would want, themselves included. Um, but the stories are fascinating, you know.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, it, it, I&#8217;ve, I read the founders at workbook and it was really cool, but, and a lot of it is serendipity.<br></p>



<p>Yeah. And it&#8217;s like, I was gonna use a band analogy cuz of your music background [00:31:00] and just go like, you know, how does. Um, I know some mu musicians and I&#8217;m like, one pretty dang popular in the nineties, eighties and nineties. Mm-hmm. And, uh, spent some time with him. Really great guy, but I was like, I always wanna go.<br></p>



<p>How did the, like he&#8217;s played with that, his band for, you know, A long time and they&#8217;ve had success together and it&#8217;s like, how do you, how does that come together? Is always the magic for me. And then how do they make this great music that a lot of the best bands I&#8217;ve heard, you know, they need, like Dave Matthews was the continuum.<br></p>



<p>You&#8217;re like, man, great voice. But I&#8217;ve also heard like he wouldn&#8217;t be Dave Matthews and Dave Matthews band without all the incredible musicians around him. He happens to get the names stands,<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> the connections he had and stuff like that.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, that was very much, iThemes , by the way, I got way more credit and I can&#8217;t sing so[00:32:00]&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> well. But um, yeah, and I think that, thank you. I think you&#8217;ve sort of. In some ways summarized what, what I, my rambling was trying to get at is the, it&#8217;s everything is the sum of its parts, right? And so it&#8217;s like, there was a point where I thought that I would snap my fingers, um, and not that I didn&#8217;t work really, really hard, um, but I now understand that it&#8217;s so much more as the building blocks, the sum of the building blocks, um, and the culmination of things.<br></p>



<p>And like a lot of bands, you know, I love, in fact, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m rereading Elton John&#8217;s book. Um, great read by the way. I&#8217;m not a fan of Elton John. I, when I read it the first time, I went back and literally tried to listen to some of his music and I couldn&#8217;t get through most of it. It&#8217;s just so not to my taste.<br></p>



<p>Um, I&#8217;m wrong. Don&#8217;t, there? There is no question that I am, I am wrong. Literally, [00:33:00] billions of people love his music and I don&#8217;t, so I am wrong here. But the book is really fun. Um, well written self effacing. Self self deprecating. Um, and, and I&#8217;m a music history nerd. Um, but it&#8217;s the, you know how things came.<br></p>



<p>Um, you know, and he definitely is magical, musically. Um, but he, he watch the past tense of grind grounded. He, he worked really, really hard for a really long time and with a lot of people, and people came and went and stuff like that, you know, so at some point you and I are. Reach a a point where you&#8217;re gonna fire me and hire somebody better and keep going with the band.<br></p>



<p>Um, and I will be the pee best. Um, you know, the long lost drummer, original drummer of the Beatles, um, who will die in obscurity. [00:34:00] And I accept,&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I don&#8217;t think so, cuz you, you, you forget. I don&#8217;t know how to sing and it&#8217;s not gonna be as fun at all without the drums and guitar solo and everything you&#8217;ve done so.<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> But anyway, why don&#8217;t, why don&#8217;t you share your screen if you have the, the read me. I think, I feel like the brainstorming we did last time worked well. Like you were typing, typing, typing, um, while we were both chatting, if that works. Yep. So we&#8217;re here.<br></p>



<p>Nice. Oh, so there&#8217;s an edit option. That&#8217;s cool. Uh, bottom left, there&#8217;s a button that&#8217;s an edit. Can we make our changes right in it? Cool.<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> You know what, we&#8217;ll wanna go back when we do the, the new brand that we talked about, we&#8217;ll wanna come back and put the links here.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Oh, for sure. [00:35:00] Okay,<br></p>



<p>so I go to, we&#8217;re press. Slash plugins<br></p>



<p>and I search for crop<br></p>



<p>and I&#8217;m seeing what else comes up. And like there&#8217;s a, yeah, image aspect ratio. Custom fields for, um, a ACF crop and image as keywords. Um, I also heard from, I did a, um, a call with um, Matt Cromwell and, um, I hate to say it, but Leslie Pizza, um, cuz I can never remember her last name and I think she actually, like a lot of people call her Leslie Pizza.<br></p>



<p>Um, But, uh, they were helping me [00:36:00] review one of my other plugins and said that we can actually have up to 12 keywords. Uh, just the first, I think, five show up. So, uh, I was actually misinformed that, or I, under, I had the wrong knowledge that, uh, I thought we could only have a few keywords. So, um, I think on that, on that first screen, Plug in maybe.<br></p>



<p>Yeah, I saw tags. So, um,<br></p>



<p>like I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m wondering if, I mean this is, and this is all always speculation, but is, is it better to have image crop or is it better to just have crop? To me, you don&#8217;t crop, you don&#8217;t crop anything that isn&#8217;t an image. So I, it might ju we might, image, crop might be. Cropping is good though.[00:37:00]&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So I had crop and cropping. Since we can add more tags, that&#8217;s good knowledge,&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> right?<br></p>



<p>In WordPress, uh, featured images are often called thumbnails.<br></p>



<p>Um, oh, media library. Now that we have that, it&#8217;s probably, you know, if people are looking for ways that they are manipulating images in the media library, maybe they search for media library.<br></p>



<p>Um, I can&#8217;t imagine that people are looking for the term aspect. Um,<br></p>



<p>More likely they&#8217;re looking for, oh, image size, right? Like we had the, the guy message me and say, I need, you know, I need [00:38:00] all images, need to ultimately be 700 by 500 or whatever it was, like image size. Um, so anyway, I feel like that flushes it out a lot more. Okay.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s awesome. I mean, that&#8217;s really good base level things.<br></p>



<p>We gotta just check the box for. Uh, do I push saver update code? I&#8217;m always the Control s. Control s. Command desk. Command desk, right.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Um, I probably save, I I imagine that Save actually does both. I just remember that Save took a long time. Okay.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Um. Okay. I put cropping here and I put precise. I took out feature damages, but is there anything else you see that we should probably like a list of features maybe[00:39:00]&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I. So up to 150 characters, um, I&#8217;m still looking at the description first. Um, it seems like, uh, do you have a, something that&#8217;ll tell us how many characters we&#8217;re using there? Go stick it in a fake tweet or something though. So I guess they just give you. A counter,<br></p>



<p>I think like, so I do, I [00:40:00] think we could just say crop images in WordPress Z or is that a sentence? It&#8217;s awesome. I think that&#8217;s really good. WordPress easily, but I, I guess my point is I, we&#8217;re not using 150 characters. Let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s add more words. Um, and WordPress easier. Dash featured image media library.<br></p>



<p>You know, it&#8217;s a little bit of, um, keyword.<br></p>



<p>I mean, we had the block too. Mm-hmm. Prop images and WordPress.[00:41:00]&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Uh,<br></p>



<p>say Guttenberg block,<br></p>



<p>like, um, image crop or guttenberg block. I just always feel like we need, I, I&#8217;m not convinced that people. Only at like truly think of it, it&#8217;s just the block editor. Do you know what I mean? Yeah.<br></p>



<p>[00:42:00] Yeah, that&#8217;s.<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Probably have all these memorized, but I was gonna go back into the plugin. So we have mm-hmm. Go ahead.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Um, just the, that we can, um, keyword stuff, the title too. So going back to the plugin tab, crop express,<br></p>



<p>crop express, four featured images or, um,<br></p>



<p>I&#8217;m just trying to think of what the key, what the keywords might be like. Hmm. [00:43:00] I don&#8217;t think we need WordPress.<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, I was trying to say something like car is a,<br></p>



<p>it keeps it native, I guess. Like you don&#8217;t have to go outside of WordPress. There&#8217;s a better term for that, I&#8217;m sure.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Right, but I guess this, this is more like, this is more search rankings. I literally think repeating Crop Express for featured images for media library for Gutenberg block. Um,<br></p>



<p>yeah, I think, I think that that&#8217;s, to me, that&#8217;s what, what the purpose would be. It&#8217;s, it doesn&#8217;t hurt, like those are human readable words, but I do think it helps the seo.<br></p>



<p>Okay. [00:44:00] And I put block, I don&#8217;t know how long this can be, right? Uh, I mean, short pixels is pretty long. Say what?<br></p>



<p>I am, I&#8217;m comparing other ones in the repo and like short, short pixel image optimizer Dash Optimize Image is Convert WebP and a V I f. Like they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re, the title of theirs is 66 characters, so I feel like we&#8217;re, we&#8217;ve got room to play with.[00:45:00]&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Uh, the sentence above, you can take out featured images, so crop express speeds up your content workflow. Uh, giving you uniform images for your blog post. I think you can take out featured because we now have expanded, but I still love this intro. Um, so even the title at the top, make cropping featured images you can take out featured.<br></p>



<p>So making<br></p>



<p>that what you meant right here. Yeah, and, and again, that I think that could be similar to the short description. So rather than make cropping images, we could just say crop images easier.<br></p>



<p>Yep. I think it&#8217;s bad English, [00:46:00] but I think it.<br></p>



<p>But I think, yeah, we define the problem, we define the high level solution well, and then talk about features, which is the formula you&#8217;re kind of supposed to follow. Mm-hmm.<br></p>



<p>Nice.<br></p>



<p>And I would even add another one, uh, below that first one you just said. Say, um, something like, uh, round avatar images or something like that. Like shapes is shapes and down the road we can add [00:47:00] stars and rainbows and unicorns if we want. But you know, I still think that it&#8217;s pretty amazing that you can crop a circle.<br></p>



<p>Uh, yeah, there you go.<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Love it<br></p>



<p>and the set sizing defaults give. I don&#8217;t know if guardrails communicate cross cultures, but um, to me it&#8217;s like put those Boeing bumpers on your client, right? From like doing crappy stuff. So giving some, you&#8217;re kind of making it easier on your client by giving them some base. You&#8217;re, you&#8217;re actually taking out the [00:48:00] possibility of error on the client you deliver work for by giving them some.<br></p>



<p>So keep them for,&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> um, Prevent uploading the wrong,<br></p>



<p>wrong image, like it&#8217;s really wrong size and shape image, but that&#8217;s really wordy.<br></p>



<p>Huge images that slow down your site. There you go. Nice.<br></p>



<p>Yep.<br></p>



<p>Um, you could also, uh, another, you another new under the, the second item is, um, media library.[00:49:00]&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Just throw things out just to get us going.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Absolutely.<br></p>



<p>Yeah, we&#8217;ve got, at this point we&#8217;ve got the three integration points, featured images, media library, and Gutenberg block. Um, and then we&#8217;ve got settings.<br></p>



<p>[00:50:00] Settings.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Got the block you said, I&#8217;m sorry. Feature damage image and then the standalone block? Mm-hmm. Okay.<br></p>



<p>I&#8217;m just testing that. I don&#8217;t know if it works. [00:51:00] I almost feel like putting this above here and then, you know, new, like the first one is the block. Yep. That&#8217;s cool. It&#8217;s in post copy images by sizes set. Image<br></p>



<p>three, need it. Let&#8217;s see. I almost feel like this needs to be, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t want to nitpick it too much. Image sizing.<br></p>



<p>Okay. Anything I missed?&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> No, I think this is a great next version. Okay.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Save it. Mm-hmm.[00:52:00]&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Can you do custom ratios? Mm-hmm.<br></p>



<p>Where already said that. See, so it&#8217;s really a square circle or&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> you&#8217;re accustom, right? I I feel like, I mean, it&#8217;s circle, circle or anything else. So, um, pick the most pocket aspect ratios or create your own. Crop a circle if you want to kind of thing. Yeah, I mean they&#8217;re, cuz they&#8217;re all,[00:53:00]&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>yeah, I think that&#8217;s great. You&#8217;re done. Okay.<br></p>



<p>Now do you just need this? Yeah, so if you&#8217;ve hit update code and it updated, uh, cuz I&#8217;m not seeing our new tags in there, so I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve updated. Oh. Update code. There we go. There we go. Yeah. So send that to me and I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll drop it in. Cool.<br></p>



<p>Done. Great. Um, so I actually need to bounce. Okay. Um, But yeah, you send that to me. Uh, we&#8217;ll plug that in. I&#8217;ll upload it later today. And then, um, again, I I, there&#8217;s a little bit of a long tail, there&#8217;s a couple more the settings that we wanted to add and [00:54:00] stuff like that, but, um, you know, let&#8217;s, again, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m excited to kind of let it, let it simmer for a while.<br></p>



<p>Yeah.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. Sounds good to me. I&#8217;m gonna put some notes about the next topic. In chat, um, just so that We&#8217;ll, they&#8217;ll be there and I won&#8217;t lose them.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;m, yeah, no problem. I&#8217;m getting lost, but, um, yeah, we could also, let&#8217;s, you know, let&#8217;s schedule a call, uh, tomorrow, Friday, too. Okay.<br></p>



<p>Sounds&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> good, man. Enjoy San Francisco.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Thank you. Thanks man.</p>

<h2 class="eplus-wrapper wp-block-heading" id="h-transcript">Transcript</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Session 8 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>



<p>Corey Maass: [00:00:00] Sort of summarize the, summarize what we wanted, all of the features<br>we wanted, where we&#8217;re at, and then what the next steps are. Okay. Because I think, I think the<br>power balance is about to shift the power balance. Yeah. Previously we were waiting for me, I<br>think we&#8217;re, oh, I think I&#8217;m, I think I&#8217;m caught up.<br>And so I think we&#8217;re stepping more into w you know, you being able to do stuff for, um, you<br>know, we can start working on marketing assets and the website and stuff like that because the<br>plugin&#8217;s actually worth talking about .<br>Cory Miller: Okay. Gotcha. Well, do you want to catch me up on where we&#8217;re at with the<br>product?<br>Then we can shift gears to what&#8217;s<br>Corey Maass: next. Yeah, so the good news is, [00:01:00] um, we had started with Featured<br>image and I had jumped over and featured Image was, uh, had a nice walkthrough or a nice<br>flow. Choose your image, choose your shape, do your cropping. There it is. Um, I had added a<br>bypass button, um, and then had started stubbing out settings, um, so that you could build your<br>own, um, presets or calling them your own shapes, basically.<br>Um, size, width, whatever. Um, and then I had jumped over to Media Library cuz that was the<br>other one that I really wanted, or the next one that I really wanted, again, as a non guttenberg<br>user. Um, And so had brought that up to speed. So it, [00:02:00] now, if you go into media<br>library, there&#8217;s now a second button at the top is the choice we&#8217;ve made thus far.<br>Um, so if you go to library Yep. There&#8217;s a critical error. Uh oh.<br>is that, um, uh, we need to start using Insta. Insta, wp,<br>Cory Miller: um, oh,<br>Corey Maass: this is just my, yeah, go to, um, go to Insta WP and do it. Spin up a site<br>they really want. Um, I mean they&#8217;re, this product&#8217;s amazing Anyway, so you just launch one<br>click.<br>Oh, you reach your limit. Do it in incognito. Okay.[00:03:00]<br>Hackers. Um, but they, they&#8217;ve actually offered us a, um, a test account for, um, for using to use<br>c WP for this product, for these kinds of demos. So,<br>or you can do that.<br>Passwords. I&#8217;ve memorized it. I&#8217;ve memorized it. I&#8217;m gonna hack your account.<br>No kidding. .<br>Cory Miller: Oh my God. Come on, .<br>Corey Maass: Seriously, just do, uh, incognito. You don&#8217;t have to do any of this. There you go.<br>Oh, but now you have to share that window.<br>Nothing [00:04:00] is easy. Um, but anyway. Yeah, so Well, you&#8217;re good. Well you&#8217;re setting that<br>up. Um, so media library, uh, doing two things. One is<br>cheeky boogers. Do you want me to just share? I can walk us through it. Yeah. Okay. Um, how<br>are they tracking cookies? Uh, into incognito. That&#8217;s, uh, they&#8217;re being very sneaky. I think.<br>Enter my name. I don&#8217;t want to one click log in. All right. So I&#8217;m gonna share my screen.<br>Cory Miller: Um, okay. I&#8217;m into, oh, okay. Well then go,<br>Corey Maass: Okay, I got the<br>Cory Miller: free account. There you go. You&#8217;re a hackers. Okay, yeah,<br>Corey Maass: go for it. I&#8217;m here. So, [00:05:00] uh, magic login. There you go. And then plugins<br>add new crop, express, crop of the express.<br>And this is something we need to start working on. There you go. Cuz we, we wanna be first, so<br>we&#8217;ll have to start doing some testing on that. Um, so did you notice we had 10 plus click on<br>view details?<br>Uh, we are up to over 10 active installs, 10 plus.<br>Cory Miller: Oh, is that why you were showing me that? I was like, oh man, are you having a<br>bad day? Cuz you showed me that like Active was like, yeah, but they have these gaps and<br>stuff. But what you were trying to say was the plus<br>Corey Maass: we&#8217;re over 10. We finally made it over 10.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s awesome. So yeah. So if you go to, yeah, so there&#8217;s now, uh, [00:06:00] settings, uh,<br>crop Express. Um, I put in just a little placeholder welcome. And what we&#8217;ve got here is identical<br>settings, but for all three instances of crop express, right? So you can crop, uh, your featured<br>image in posts, you can crop. There&#8217;s a block in Gutenberg and then media library.<br>So, um, all of them are, are identical. So click on media library, cuz then we&#8217;ll jump over to that.<br>Um, so you&#8217;ve got your presets. Um, so all of the default ones you can turn on and off and then<br>you can add your own. And then down below, uh, are the sizes and we just populate with some<br>sensible defaults, basically.<br>But you can say, uh, you know, make my image, um, oh, defaults shouldn&#8217;t say [00:07:00] max,<br>so I need to fix that. Um, but it&#8217;s the, if you upload a square, it&#8217;ll, it&#8217;ll automatically generate an<br>image that&#8217;s 2000 by 2000. Um, but if you up upload a rectangle one way or the other, The<br>wider side will be the maximum and the, and the smaller side will be the minimum.<br>Mm-hmm. , um, it took me a while to figure out what the heck they were talking about with Men&#8217;s<br>Max and default, but it&#8217;s that, so we need some, some happy text there to explain that. Um, and<br>then, yeah, so if you go back up to the top portion, portion in this page and turn off a couple of<br>these, the four threes or something, whatever, um, and then hit save.<br>And then if you go to media library or media in your menu, um, and if you click add new, it<br>automatically throws you back [00:08:00] to the media library, but with the crop Express open so<br>that you&#8217;re always using it. Um, which could be an option that we give. Um, and then, um, but,<br>and if you go to Media Library and say, Add new, there&#8217;s again, there&#8217;s a new button at the top.<br>Cory Miller: Okay. Can we go back for just one second cuz I wanna make sure I understand<br>this so that I could give feedback and help people. So yeah, of course. Okay. I think this is what</p>



<p>tripped me up and it&#8217;s probably, cuz I&#8217;ve got old, old school, Adobe Photoshop in mind. Mm-<br>hmm. . But we&#8217;re saying for all the image settings, like here is the preset ratios in a sense, but</p>



<p>it&#8217;s not just ratios, it&#8217;s like circles. It&#8217;s the preset what.<br>Corey Maass: Sure . Um, I&#8217;ve [00:09:00] gone back and forth between, uh, shapes and sizes.<br>So originally we were calling them sizes, but they&#8217;re not really sizes cuz that&#8217;s Yeah. Pixels. So<br>shapes, um, or preset aspect ratios is what they really are.<br>Mm-hmm. , I just, I worry that people don&#8217;t, that&#8217;s progress, right? Like that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the most<br>correct way to put it. Um, but people don&#8217;t think that way. Mm-hmm. or like, again, using, using<br>one of my clients, uh, using my clients as an example, um, one of them this week, we kept<br>going back and forth unrelated to the plugin.<br>Obviously we kept going back and forth where, uh, she&#8217;s like, there&#8217;s a bug about uploading an<br>image. And I, I had it. Um, set so that they could upload, they should upload 16.9 featured<br>[00:10:00] images and, and she&#8217;s like, yeah, but what if it&#8217;s really tall? And I&#8217;m like, 16 nine is<br>16.9. And in her head, 16.9 and nine 16 are the same thing.<br>And Hmm. And that to me is like one, we, we can do some education, but two, you know, people<br>aren&#8217;t, uh, people don&#8217;t, aren&#8217;t nerds like me and thinking about 16 nine and nine 16 and yada<br>yada. So, um, yeah, I definitely think some video or a video that explains what any of this stuff<br>is. Mm-hmm. like I, maybe, maybe we&#8217;ve been taking that for granted, or now you and I on<br>session eight are, you know, in it, so we totally get it, but users may not, that kind of thing.<br>Okay.<br>Cory Miller: Um, Okay. Can we spend just a little time thinking about that? Um, yeah, of course.<br>[00:11:00] How, how nor, because I saw this and I was like, man, I know you&#8217;ve got these<br>incredibly smart thoughts about all this, but I was like, okay, I&#8217;m trying to get my head around it,<br>but if I think of, maybe I just share what I think and then Yep.<br>You compare that. Help me, because I don&#8217;t know if my knowledge is ancient. Um, okay. So I<br>go, I need a photo for, or I, I know I&#8217;m gonna want a photo featured image, whatever that is.<br>Okay. And then I go, okay, how wide is my now featured image blows this out. But I just, I go,<br>how wide do I need the photo to be?<br>Like, for most of these, I think I&#8217;m just processing my way. And then absolutely. Tell me.<br>Absolutely. Keep going. . So I go, okay. My constant pain in the butt with WordPress for years.<br>Anything like this. Yeah. Is you&#8217;re constrained [00:12:00] by column width mostly. Okay.<br>Featured image. Image. Just like our post stuff. I hate it because it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t want post<br>billboards on top of our, our posts.<br>I want them to get to the post anyway, so thank you for letting me digress. . Okay. So I go, I&#8217;m<br>writing a post, I want an image for it. I either think featured type in like a big image that kind of</p>



<p>sets the tone, but to me, I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve always still gone, like it&#8217;s the post width. Mm-hmm. . Um, and I<br>don&#8217;t like the featured image issue there because in themes, for instance, like I&#8217;ll do an image<br>because.<br>I would do want to set a tone, but then it ends up in the featured and then a lot of themes will<br>pull that and it just looks wonky to me. Yeah. Like I haven&#8217;t thought about it, maybe thought<br>about it correctly, but I go, I want an image [00:13:00] and I default to width, like mm-hmm. , how<br>wide is, you know, the newsletter or the blog post or the theme that I have.<br>And then I kind of wanted to crop down to that specification appropriately for me. And<br>sometimes I just go, I just want width. And I&#8217;ll kind of adjust the height if I have a tool that lets me<br>do that. Um, like, I&#8217;m trying to think. When I was cropping in Photoshop, I would set, maybe we<br>could pull up photo.<br>I don&#8217;t have Photoshop, but I would go to their little cropping tool and go, I want it to be, what I<br>would do, Corey, is I would. Previously go it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, four or 500 pixels is typically what<br>I&#8217;ve locked in my memory somehow is like most column widths for posts are four to 500 pixels<br>wide. Mm-hmm.<br>So I&#8217;d go and Photoshop, I&#8217;d go [00:14:00] to the crop tool, I&#8217;d have my image up, I&#8217;d go to the<br>crop tool and I&#8217;d say 400. And I would leave the height, um, uh, open. Mm-hmm. . And because,<br>you know, not every image does that. And then go, okay. Crop and save. Mm-hmm. , um, and<br>then upload to the, to WordPress. But again, I&#8217;m gonna acknowledge, I don&#8217;t even know if that&#8217;s<br>all probably the right workflow, but that&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve done it.<br>Yeah. You know,<br>Corey Maass: I, I think so. I, I think you&#8217;re right. Like one of my takeaways from that is,<br>I think we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re at a high level anyway. We&#8217;re making the same point that people don&#8217;t think<br>about aspect ratios necessarily as aspect ratios. But, you know, and talking about previously<br>we&#8217;ve talked about, uh, [00:15:00] consistency and that kind of thing, um, and, and making<br>images appear correct for your theme.<br>And so using featured image, you know, something&#8217;s popped into my head, which I think is a<br>neat idea. Um, featured image. So using featured image specifically, it&#8217;s like, how wide do you<br>need it? How wide does your theme want your image to be? And then what aspect ratio do you<br>want it to be? Mm-hmm. . So it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re, you go, you go look at, and we could do a little<br>video that&#8217;s like create a post.<br>Laura Ipsum post, add an image, even even publish it privately. And then go look at the image<br>and how it looks and you right click on it. Like we can give some instructions, but it&#8217;s like right<br>click on it, you know, how big is it rendering, [00:16:00] you know, and, and make your screen<br>the biggest. It it could, it can go.<br>So it&#8217;s like you, your theme is a maximum of 1300 pixels wide. And currently your design says<br>your image, your images go full width. So, so 1300 is the number you want. So width 1300. And<br>then we could e and we could do something, do a little UI in here that&#8217;s like, okay, here&#8217;s a<br>placeholder image, 1300 pixels wide.<br>You know, how much height do you want? That&#8217;s your aspect ratio. So click on 16 nine, right?<br>And it&#8217;s like, keep in mind, I mean, this is all education. Like I don&#8217;t, I&#8217;m not really sure how we<br>get there, but, um mm-hmm. , uh, but to say like, keep in mind, you know, on small screens, like<br>if you&#8217;re going 1300 wide, you don&#8217;t want to be, you know, 1300 tall and you really don&#8217;t wanna<br>be nine [00:17:00] 16 cuz then you are, you know, tw 2000 tall or whatever it is.<br>And it&#8217;s like, that takes, here&#8217;s why the re the reason is you don&#8217;t, you don&#8217;t want your reader to<br>have to scroll and scroll and scroll before actually getting to your words unless you do. Um, but<br>yeah, that&#8217;s, I think that&#8217;s something that, that we&#8217;re gonna have to<br>education too is, is a very grand word, but it&#8217;s like people don&#8217;t think about it. This much. Maybe,<br>you know, if they&#8217;re a writer, then they&#8217;ve never thought about it. They just grabbed a photo,<br>made it look cool. Mm-hmm. and uploaded. Mm-hmm. . And never thought other than like, do I<br>want a circle or not A circle.<br>Or there&#8217;s, I want a picture of a guy on a beach building a sandcastle and I don&#8217;t want the, the<br>shark in the background, so I&#8217;m gonna crop it.<br>Cory Miller: So I wonder, are there websites, [00:18:00] and I just happened to think of<br>beginner cause I know they do things really well. Like the final product, what mm-hmm. , see<br>how they do like this technically.</p>



<p>Is there feature featured image? Mm-hmm. . Um, is there any other sites, I don&#8217;t want to just<br>hone in on this, but any other sites you think do a really good job of using photos in their blog<br>posts that we could look at real quick? Be The reason why I say that is because mm-hmm. .<br>Final product is really kind of what we&#8217;re selling.<br>You know what I mean? Like what they&#8217;re trying to get to is we, we had that extended talk where<br>we said, you know, it&#8217;s somehow flavors up the content and kind of Right. You know. Um, do you<br>have anybody else you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d like that we could just kinda look and get some ideas real<br>quick?<br>Corey Maass: Uh, no, cuz I never go to blogs.<br>Cory Miller: Okay. [00:19:00] Well let&#8217;s use them real quick. So see, like, I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;ve<br>tagged this as a featured image, you know, in WordPress mm-hmm. , but you go, okay, from an<br>SEO side, headline, gray headline music and WordPress. Two good things they&#8217;re gonna get,<br>then they&#8217;ve got enough text here. I mean, this is a great formula, WP Beginner, you know?<br>Yeah. Because yeah, they own all the WordPress search terms. Um, what about to, so yeah, so<br>intro, and then they give this little nice little thing. So what are they doing here? They&#8217;re<br>restating, restating the, the headline and then providing something that looks kind of nice. Like, I<br>think this adds value to the Post personally.<br>Corey Maass: So go, go to, uh, Freemius . They always have good blog posts.[00:20:00]<br>Go to any of them. Um, and so these, I think this to me is the more standard blog post format.<br>Click on any. Um, I like Zach, right? So big image in this case, they have the headline over the<br>image and then a blog post. And so I bet the, the background of Zach is the featured image.<br>Okay.<br>Entry header. Entry thumbnail,[00:21:00]<br>yeah. With a title overlay.<br>And their image is 1600 by 500. So an aspect ratio of 16 five. 16 five.<br>Cory Miller: So there&#8217;s a lot here that I really like. Um, like this is a nice looking featured<br>images. Mm-hmm. , they&#8217;re taking, you know, they&#8217;re really, I think this is gonna be important for<br>us if you&#8217;ll indulge me for a second. Mm-hmm. . Um, okay. So they&#8217;ve taken profile photos easy.<br>I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re creating this, like where are they getting, how are they doing all these, but<br>looks standard, right?<br>Like there&#8217;s the same character,<br>Corey Maass: their little robot is theirs, so they must have an illustrator who&#8217;s creating them.<br>[00:22:00] But I bet some of this is probably just clip art,<br>but somebody&#8217;s taking the time to create these images. Yeah. Canva. P. Yeah. You know, some<br>other editor.<br>Cory Miller: Okay,<br>same here. Like, probably find the source to do that. Cutting. These are like screenshots, which<br>I think kind of might flow into your other project you were talking about, right?<br>Corey Maass: Ooh, here&#8217;s another good example. Um, go to, I&#8217;m gonna send it to in Slack.<br>What&#8217;s your name again? Just kidding. Bob<br>So this is actually really, I just googled for, you know, baking blog or [00:23:00] something, but<br>this is actually really neat. So this tape I, this jumps we&#8217;re jumped right into a category, but look<br>at the aspect ratio of these images. And if you click on any of them, they&#8217;re the. They&#8217;re the<br>same. And if you click through, they&#8217;re actually using the featured image, uh, to the side of the<br>title.<br>So like, here, here, I see it twice, go hit back once and click on the first one. There&#8217;s like swirly<br>brownies, which look very good. Yeah. Click on that. So there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s, you know, big brownie<br>image. Scroll down a little and let&#8217;s see if they use it again. I&#8217;m just curious. Yeah, so it does<br>repeat, but you see, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s the, the coincidentally, I found a blog that has featured images that<br>are taller than they are wide, little unconventional, but again, an a, a different, a another<br>example of a [00:24:00] different layout.<br>Right. So you found, you went to WP Beginner. They use, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s horizontal. And it&#8217;s in line. So<br>it&#8217;s gonna be smaller cuz it&#8217;s in that with it&#8217;s confined, confined by that column. Go to Freemius .<br>It&#8217;s, you know, 1600, it&#8217;s full width cuz they&#8217;re using it the way, um, I often think of a blog, they<br>want a big, big, big image that takes up the full header.<br>Um, and then found a cooking blog that does taller rather than wider, which I, I was sort of<br>including to just include, but coincidentally right away found a blog that does in fact do that. Um,</p>



<p>and so I think what, you know, what we&#8217;re really getting at is, uh, again, it&#8217;s the, you know,<br>you&#8217;ve selected a theme or you already have a theme.<br>How are the images being shown? [00:25:00] And so the, you know, the, let&#8217;s pretend that<br>Hummingbird High. Is, uh, an amateur blogger. And so they are new to WordPress. Um, and so<br>they install a theme and they add start adding recipes, and they&#8217;re just taking, like we&#8217;ve talked<br>about, they&#8217;re just taking photos off their phone.<br>So they don&#8217;t know. I think, you know, to your point, they&#8217;re like, I haven&#8217;t put in any posts yet. I<br>don&#8217;t know how big I need my images. Um, the theme seems to want such and such an aspect<br>ratio where I&#8217;ve read the, let&#8217;s pretend they&#8217;re even like, nerdy enough to read the docs. Do the<br>docs include any mention of here&#8217;s how big you want your images, that kind of thing.<br>And so yeah, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a need for. [00:26:00] Again, the, the most thorough process of like<br>AIP, post, add a fake image, even temporarily, see how it renders, and then tho that&#8217;s the<br>information you want. Um, and I don&#8217;t know how to do that. I don&#8217;t know that we can do that for<br>them because as we&#8217;ve shown, you know, if you&#8217;ve got a blog that, if you&#8217;ve got a layout that<br>doesn&#8217;t label your featured image as a featured image, like I have no way of going and writing a<br>little code that like goes and scrapes it.<br>Mm-hmm. and imports that and tries to import that information.<br>Cory Miller: So what if we looked at the, okay, yes, that is, um, all that stuff underneath all this<br>that someone would need to, if they&#8217;re really gonna do this at a high, high level, they need to<br>understand all that stuff. Um, you [00:27:00] know, like really what is your theme?<br>I think for the premise for this free one could be like, if I just look at WP Beginner, um, you want<br>to, the outcome is nice looking, um, scaled appropriate images. There&#8217;s an NCO side to it, but<br>like how do you get somebody, and this is bigger than the plugin right now for sure, but you go, I<br>think a huge win could be like this makes it easier to get nice images that kind of break up.<br>Mm-hmm. your post and show specific things. And if I just go default. Don&#8217;t worry about themes<br>so much cuz those could be specific integrations. Like Cadence has an integration builder.<br>Builder. Right. You know, specific for that. That could be all that paid stuff that we talked about.<br>Yeah. But if I [00:28:00] go, if we keep it the way it is now, which is in, well it&#8217;s either fit featured<br>image, which for sure has the theme stuff that you were talking about, where you go in post,<br>how do you create something like, like this is, these sites we&#8217;ve seen have for are formulas and<br>I&#8217;m trying to think through how we can get through the formula is an easy button to nice looking<br>blog post with some images appropriately sized.<br>Mm-hmm. , um, you know, like I&#8217;ve long admired what WP Beginner does cause they&#8217;ve got this<br>formula that works. Like, yeah. All this, every post. Not trying to, this is not a negative to me.<br>Every post is a very defined formula. Yep. Screenshots are in here, you know? Um, they do<br>have to create an image and then still get it in there.<br>So they, that&#8217;s part of their formula. Just like your, [00:29:00] the baking site with the brownies,<br>you were, you were pulling apart the tech specs for how they do all that. And it seems like, yeah,<br>so anchoring back, back in these presets is like, how do you just get somebody to, Hmm. Sorry,<br>I&#8217;m probably getting a little lost in my own thoughts here, but<br>Corey Maass: as long as you keep talking,<br>you&#8217;re good.<br>Cory Miller: Um. But you go, like when you buy, when you get a product or you buy a product,<br>whatever, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re really buying whatever the result of it is, you&#8217;re actually not buying the<br>product, you&#8217;re buying this out, this outcome.<br>Corey Maass: And when you buy a piece of software and fire it up, you start hacking away at it,<br>Photoshop you, you&#8217;re create new and then, [00:30:00] and it, and it says, here&#8217;s some, here&#8217;s<br>some document sizes, but you know, here&#8217;s a thousand by a thousand, a white canvas.<br>And off you go. And then you&#8217;re like, well, but I really want, I wanna see my text options. I wanna<br>see. And so then you start playing with what menus to show or hide or you start playing with,<br>and that&#8217;s when you dig in, right? So, um, yeah, I, we, what would be great, and this is, this is<br>sort of what we&#8217;ve started with.<br>again, sensible presets I, or sensible, I mean, I, again, I&#8217;m calling &#8217;em presets, preset aspect<br>ratios. So if somebody doesn&#8217;t go to the setting screen at all, they click featured image. They&#8217;ve<br>got six predefined aspect ratios that, again, are sensible. Um, and they&#8217;ve got, and, and they<br>don&#8217;t know anything about sizes, but we&#8217;ve put in some pretty [00:31:00] industry standard.</p>



<p>Mm-hmm. , safe for mobile, safe for desktop image size, men and Max. So we might be pretty<br>close to what you&#8217;re talking about. Mm-hmm. and maybe six isn&#8217;t the magic number. Maybe it<br>should only be Square Circle and 16, nine. And the other ones are. Extra. So maybe it&#8217;s too<br>many. We don&#8217;t know that yet, but,<br>Cory Miller: well, you know what, I lost track a little bit of the settings page because this was<br>intended for the agency, like mm-hmm.<br>I mean, you deliver, like, one of our thesis here was you deliver a client project. This really, like<br>the intention for the settings was for those freelancers, web owners, agencies delivering<br>products or delivering websites to clients. And then from that point, like I was trying to reconcile<br>the settings page with just [00:32:00] being a user, but that wasn&#8217;t our intention.<br>Our intention was give those tools to put in the little scoot in the little bumpers on the bowling<br>lane, right? Like that&#8217;s what the agency does pull, you know, Hey, were you, we, whatever<br>theme framework we use, we know it&#8217;s gonna be 69. You know, put the minimal X. Yeah. And<br>then when they do that stuff from the featured image, And, and the user starts using it, it&#8217;s<br>already there.<br>So we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve taken this thought of like, this is, to me, this is for an agency to ship better<br>guardrails for images for their client work. Yeah. So my question to you, I mean, as a, you&#8217;ve set<br>this up with the thought, I thought, you know, as a developer, right? So like, I, I&#8217;m not, but I go,<br>your mindset was to do, put these tools, settings in here for that technical person at the agency.<br>Yeah. Or we delivered it. [00:33:00] Make sure this is like, go through real quick and set these,<br>and that&#8217;s, that was our intention for this. Yep. So as long as it speaks to the, like, I don&#8217;t have to<br>note it, know it necessarily as a user, as long as the devs do. And if we check that box, I think<br>it&#8217;s, we ship it and we start talking about like, we, what we try to do is give a.<br>Guard, I&#8217;m rehearsing some of this for a copy. Mm-hmm. , it was like, this is to give guardrails to<br>your clients for their images. Take, take it, take 30 seconds, you know, when before you deliver<br>the client and do these real quick, and then you&#8217;ll put the little bumpers on the bowling alley for<br>&#8217;em.<br>Corey Maass: Yeah. And I, I think I want to, the only, the only caveat or addition I want to add to<br>what you just said is that it&#8217;s not, let&#8217;s not say dev, right, because dev implies code is, it&#8217;s a scary<br>thing to [00:34:00] a lot of people, whereas.<br>Uh, you know, in my mind the, the word like there, there&#8217;s never been a good word for the<br>people who are WordPress pros who don&#8217;t necessarily write code or write a lot of code or write<br>custom plugins, right? So there&#8217;s still experts in my mind at some, at some time. Like 10 years<br>ago the word was, um, that I was introduced was implementer.<br>So it&#8217;s like someone who implements WordPress and WordPress tools but isn&#8217;t a developer,<br>right? But, so to me, this is like somebody who doesn&#8217;t even, doesn&#8217;t write code, but is setting<br>up a site for a client, installs their favorite theme, knows that the theme looks great with 16 nine<br>images. And so they&#8217;re the ones that are gonna go in and tweak these settings.<br>Um, and so, yeah, and, and I think the analogy of, there&#8217;s nothing that says. There&#8217;s really<br>nothing that [00:35:00] says you have to even touch that setting screen if 16, nine or circle<br>meets your needs. Um, and then the, and, but, but I agree, like the language could be a, a heck<br>of a lot friendlier. Um, and we need docs that explain it, right?<br>Um, and so that&#8217;s where like, I think, I think you come in and the kind of thinking that you&#8217;re<br>doing of, you know, the, the, the unknowledgeable, the as yet unknowledgeable user, you know.<br>So on that little welcome screen, on the settings page, it says, welcome, you know, watch a<br>62nd video that explains what the heck is going on here with 10 seconds.<br>That explains, you know, why image size and shape is important in the simplest possible terms.<br>Um, And then the other thing that just occurred to me is actually that, that you kind of alluded<br>[00:36:00] to is, uh, I don&#8217;t remember how you put it, but the, the idea of the sort of pre preset,<br>like, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m way down, I&#8217;m close to the metal where I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m calling a preset, or when I say<br>preset, I&#8217;m saying preset aspect ratio.<br>But I, but you actually kind of alluded to, um, like a preset featured image or a preset something,<br>something, right? Mm-hmm. . Um, and I realized that like, again, what I&#8217;ve created I think is a<br>great, we&#8217;re still on version 0.0 0.3. Mm-hmm. , so I think it&#8217;s appropriate. Um, but, uh, uh, and<br>so, or what I&#8217;m say, sorry.</p>



<p>Um, we have the crop. That is identical in three different places. Right? Featured image. And the<br>likelihood is your, what, what The assumption that we&#8217;re going under, which I think is, is pretty<br>safe, is [00:37:00] you always, once you get rolling, you always want your featured image to be<br>the same size and shape. Mm-hmm.<br>So that mm-hmm. , all of your posts look consistent. Mm-hmm. . And the same might go for,<br>might not go for in, in post images, cuz you might want a smaller one shifted, left or shifted right.<br>You might want an infographic that&#8217;s tall and so you don&#8217;t necessarily want to be confined, but<br>here are some, some presets that, you know, look we like, you know, getting a level deeper with<br>design is you often want.<br>Your images to be similar throughout a website, the same way you want fonts to be. Similar<br>throughout a website, you want colors to be similar without throughout a website. So, you know,<br>in a perfect world, not that you shouldn&#8217;t sometimes break the rules, but you often want, if your<br>featured images are all 16, nine, you know, [00:38:00] design a a design guideline might<br>encourage you to have 16, nine images elsewhere.<br>That&#8217;s a little digression, but I think that&#8217;s true. And then taking this even further, if you go to the<br>media library, uh, again, right now for the sake of simplicity, I&#8217;ve got the same settings and the<br>same UI applied to the media library, upload a 16 nine image. But here I actually see, uh, a<br>different, or I&#8217;m envisioning a different UI that says, Upload a featured image, which uses the<br>settings from the featured images.<br>But we could also include things like upload an image for Twitter, upload a, you know, and this is<br>where a preset comes in, right? Upload, you know, a circles a circle, but upload a, and this is, I<br>think what, going back to, uh, the, [00:39:00] the little, um, sticker mule menu that we were<br>talking about where there&#8217;s sort of these predefined touchpoints.<br>And so, yeah, so it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re in a post, you&#8217;re writing a post. And we also, I think we<br>are spending a lot of time, we are being very word pressy. Um, and it might be to our detriment,<br>um, we are assuming anybody is actually writing a post. And I even saw a headline I think this<br>morning that was like, should WordPress get rid of the blog?<br>You know, it started as a blog, but should we, should it actually get rid of the blog focus<br>altogether? Because most people are using it as a C M S and building pages more than posts.<br>Mm-hmm. is, is the, was the hypothesis. But anyway, uh, you know, feature image images still<br>applies to pages. Um, when you&#8217;re writing a page, you know, we say in post [00:40:00] image,<br>but an in, in page image, so we&#8217;re not thinking wrong.<br>But, you know, thinking of WordPress as a c m s, you&#8217;re like, you build a page, but then you also<br>need an image for two, an OG image, open graph image for social, you might want to da da da<br>da da. And this is where we were talking about, you know, what, what you really need is an<br>image crop so that no image gets uploaded to WordPress incorrectly.<br>Mm-hmm. , right? And that&#8217;s where, uh, I, I&#8217;m, you know, again, I, we&#8217;ve sort of talked about it<br>and you kind of alluded to it a minute ago as like, within at least media library to have a, you<br>know, what kind of image do you want to upload an image for Twitter? Okay, well that needs to<br>be this size, the shape. I wanna upload a header for Facebook.<br>Or, you know, it&#8217;s like, I mean, these are bad examples cuz you&#8217;d upload those to Twitter or<br>[00:41:00] to Facebook. Um, but it could also be, uh, you know, it doesn&#8217;t even necessarily get<br>up, get saved to your media library, crop in image for Twitter. Download it and now, now post it<br>to Twitter. Crop an image for Facebook.<br>Now post it to Facebook. Do you wanna also save this in your media library?<br>and that&#8217;s where we kind of end up taking over. You know, it&#8217;s like media library bec, you know,<br>becomes, uh, Photoshop within WordPress. Okay. Now that&#8217;s interesting. Um,<br>what kind of image do you want to create today?<br>Cory Miller: You said something that was really interesting to me, um, that stuck out and it&#8217;s like<br>the c m s conversation. Hmm. Is it just the c m s or, you know, [00:42:00] do we, so I was trying<br>to find this blog site to see how they did it, but you go like, but there are people that still use<br>publishing their WordPress is their publishing tool.<br>Um, and I think of that like your client&#8217;s content journey clients mm-hmm. and. They&#8217;re using the<br>blog side. And I go, that was a helpful distinguishing for me is like if you just using the c m s, our<br>image is gonna be static. For instance, most cases, like you&#8217;re not gonna do a lot of image<br>manipulation.</p>



<p>You may in turn, uh, initially, but we&#8217;re turning over to people that are pushing the publish button.<br>Like you have a newspaper or a magazine client, for instance. They are like, they&#8217;re in the<br>business of publishing. Yeah. Steady content. And that just made me think about the use case<br>again, is I still think the settings [00:43:00] conversation is great because a lot of these people<br>are gonna have agencies build the site because they.<br>To do the publishing really fast. So we&#8217;ve given those tools to the setting, they&#8217;ll look over here.<br>It&#8217;s like I went to moz.com just to see how they use damages. Oh, sure. I went to HubSpot, like<br>the bakery site. Oh, HubSpot. Yeah.<br>Corey Maass: Since they&#8217;re big on SEO and, but I bet. But they do a lot of content.<br>Cory Miller: They&#8217;re publishers, um mm-hmm.<br>which is really interesting. That aligns with where WordPress is, you know? Yeah. Okay. Let me<br>find, try to find,<br>I, I think this is important. This isn&#8217;t wasted because it&#8217;s, um, we&#8217;re drilling down closer to<br>really crystallizing who, yeah. Who, who, yeah. Okay, so [00:44:00] lemme just go back. Okay.<br>So they&#8217;re obviously using, this is probably, Well, hope has their own thing, but like they&#8217;re using<br>some image to draw some interest to the,<br>Corey Maass: so up top you&#8217;ve got four, three. I&#8217;m just, I&#8217;m gonna keep nerding out about this<br>cuz it&#8217;s like, this is what people aren&#8217;t seeing.<br>They&#8217;re, they&#8217;re seeing but not absorbing right? Is Right. On that previous page, you had four,<br>three images and square images, and then you drill, drill down and what would be, you know, a<br>primary image at the top again after the paragraph? Looks like it&#8217;s about four three. But it, but I,<br>I, I liked your WP beginner example.<br>Same with HubSpot, is that they&#8217;re just, they&#8217;re just, they&#8217;re essentially just putting images in line<br>and just like a magazine. So you&#8217;re reading a magazine and they might have a big pretty<br>picture, but they&#8217;re, um, you know, throughout an article they&#8217;ll have [00:45:00] photos.<br>So like,<br>Cory Miller: huh, good<br>Corey Maass: God. Okay. I go to like rolling stone.com.<br>Like go to a publisher. That&#8217;s interesting. Whoops. Yeah,<br>so those look like four, three images and then some square images. Just scroll down a little<br>interesting that this layout is almost identical to, um, Huffington Post , or not Huffington Post, uh,<br>the Atlantic. If you go to the Atlantic , it&#8217;s almost identical. Um, but anyway, there&#8217;s another<br>example. So [00:46:00] like we get into actual news sites, so they&#8217;ve got those look closer to like<br>16, nine.<br>Um, yeah, go back to Rolling Stone. I don&#8217;t need to see Huffington Post homepage. That&#8217;s too<br>depressing. . Um, but click, click into, click into any one of these stories. And here&#8217;s a pretty<br>typical layout. You know, there&#8217;s that featured image again, and then the story below it, and<br>then, but I bet they have images within, I guess this one&#8217;s just a short story, but anyway.<br>Yeah. You think this is four 30? It looks pretty close. I mean, I&#8217;m eyeballing it. Yeah. But,<br>but also, but I guess close enough that if somebody who isn&#8217;t rolling Stone wanted to create<br>their own website, they&#8217;d be like, okay, every time I in. Insert an image into a story, [00:47:00] I<br>will use the four three. Like we, so we, you know what, what, I guess I never finished the<br>description of the, the new version is we have settings and we also now have a block, a<br>Gutenberg block.<br>Yeah.<br>Cory Miller: By the way, you snuck that in on me.<br>Corey Maass: Yeah. So, so we now have, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re pretty close to like feature<br>complete, right? So we have fe you can crop a featured image, you can crop, um, a Gutenberg<br>block and you can crop images going into the media library. Um, and so I think, you know,<br>again, I, uh, I th we&#8217;re focusing a lot on settings, but I think that there&#8217;s a good chance that most<br>people, your average person, will never need to go to those settings.<br>The likelihood is that most will, uh, so I called it cropped image because I think most people are<br>gonna look for image. So it says, select, select an image to crop, and then here&#8217;s our presets.<br>And so I think what most people are gonna do is [00:48:00] they&#8217;re like, they will decide, they will<br>choose four, three, and then, and then every time they do this again, they will choose four three.</p>



<p>Like, that&#8217;s how most people use these kinds of tools. Like they, they do something once or they<br>learn, click, click, click. They don&#8217;t necessarily think about optimizing their clicking, and so they&#8217;ll<br>just choose four, three every time. If it looks good, the first.<br>Cory Miller: So question about the four three. So we&#8217;ve just said this is probably one of the four,<br>three and 16 by nine, you already know this, but four three was a lot on these sites and that<br>typically, like I&#8217;d look at beginner and all these others, and I go, it&#8217;s four three, like in the, in the<br>vicinity, right?<br>So how did you determine what this with is?<br>Corey Maass: Uh, so that is what&#8217;s set by the, on the settings page. I&#8217;m not saying go there, but<br>there are, [00:49:00] um, some common sense defaults. So it&#8217;s at least a thousand wide and it&#8217;s<br>less than 2000 wide. So if you tried to upload something that was off of your phone, high res,<br>you know, 8,000 wide, it would bring it down to 2000 or something.<br>But you also, if you tried to upload just an emoji, it would make it. Bigger, unless you said<br>bypass.<br>Cory Miller: I see. Okay. So the rationale, so we&#8217;re picking four, three, and then we&#8217;ve got these<br>bigger bumpers. So like this mm-hmm. , if we, so this image is actually whatever the settings</p>



<p>are a thousand wide. So it&#8217;s technically bigger than it needs to be because of the settings. Mm-<br>hmm. . But that probably has advantages, I&#8217;m guessing, [00:50:00] for.</p>



<p>Corey Maass: For and for responsive. Like, I&#8217;ve actually built sites before that. So, you know,<br>when you think about responsive and I, I know I&#8217;m devving out here, but, um, no, go for it.<br>You&#8217;ve generally responsive. You&#8217;re thinking mobile phone, you&#8217;re thinking tablet, and you&#8217;re<br>thinking desktop. Right. And uh, I&#8217;ve actually seen sites where, uh, on desktop we had multiple<br>columns of content.<br>So the images were a third of the total width of the site, which, which didn&#8217;t go edge to edge on<br>the screen. So an image was never more than like 800 wide. But then if you looked at it on<br>tablet, it, it went to a one column view images over text and, and not multiple columns of<br>content. And so suddenly it was 10,000 or it was a thousand wide, uh, or, you know, [00:51:00]<br>the size of my iPad here with right.<br>And so it actually went wider on mobile. And so a lot of people will be messing around building<br>their website on their desktop computer or on their laptop, and then eventually they&#8217;ll look at<br>their phone or they&#8217;ll look at their tablet, um, to do, to test it, and the images will actually go<br>wider. Um, and so it&#8217;s not a bad thing to have an image that&#8217;s, again, it&#8217;s if it&#8217;s compressed,<br>which is a whole different conversation.<br>Um, and not, if it&#8217;s not four megs and 8,000 pixels wide, it&#8217;s okay. That. A little too big cuz<br>browsers will size things down. Um, and better that than then it&#8217;s the, then it&#8217;s 800 and gets<br>upsized to be 1200. Cuz that&#8217;s when it looks bad.<br>Cory Miller: Gotcha. Okay. I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m much more understanding this now and it makes [00:52:00]<br>sense, um, because it&#8217;s okay to have like a thousand, whatever the default settings are Yeah.<br>Because you&#8217;ve got these benefits, but it&#8217;s not like an 18 meg file. Exactly. You know? Exactly.<br>But it, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s in the window of like being quality image and you can set those differently if you<br>want.<br>Like in the setting. Yeah. So that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s great there. Yeah. Um, I gotta tell you, I think right here<br>you&#8217;ve nailed it. , like we&#8217;ve got the Gutenberg block. Mm-hmm. . All right, magician, how&#8217;d you,<br>how&#8217;d you get this done? Have you been working on this ? I think you told me you were gonna<br>work.<br>Corey Maass: No, no, no, no. We, so we, you know, early days when you and I first started<br>talking about this, um, I hired a couple of different developers, one who helped me out with<br>featured image and one who helped me out with block.<br>Um, and they got me [00:53:00] pretty close to the block working, but I couldn&#8217;t, I hadn&#8217;t<br>wrapped my head around. Uh, everything else that I&#8217;ve subsequently wrapped my head around<br>by building it for featured images and building it for media library. So then when I went back and<br>looked at, uh, what he did for the block, I was like, I literally copied the code from Featured<br>Image.<br>And so it took 45 minutes or something because he had already done the, the tricky part. And I,<br>again, have learned a lot more in the interim time. So, uh, so yeah, it was, it was, uh, too big of<br>a lift early on, but coming back to it, it was almost easy. So, yeah. Um, for me, I want to. See if<br>[00:54:00] I can, cuz again, I, I&#8217;m using, um, the classic editor.</p>



<p>I wanna see if I can overwrite the featured image for that. And then we&#8217;re pretty close to, um, I<br>guess we need the media, like if you click on the add, add image button, you know, in the<br>classic text editor, um, you know, there&#8217;s a couple of, of little things, but they&#8217;re not, they&#8217;re not<br>insignificant, but they are not like modern WordPress.<br>So we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re in pretty good shape. But yeah, I, I definitely would love your input. Like things<br>like, don&#8217;t call them presets, call them preset aspect ratio. Mm-hmm. , um, um, and start thinking<br>about the, you know, the happy text, the explanation text, the, um, do you upload one of your<br>broken images again? Yeah.<br>um, You know, and, and docs and, and welcome text. [00:55:00] And, and if we start talking<br>about, um, a little video for, um, you know, to put on that welcome screen, like that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s<br>where we&#8217;re at. Like starting to actually make this, uh, friendlier and, and more clear. I like your<br>guy.<br>Cory Miller: Okay, now I was just playing with that. Yep.<br>That&#8217;s awesome man. I think this is a game changer. I think this right here could be the v1, like<br>in this, you know, that&#8217;s where we started from a long time ago. We just weren&#8217;t there. We<br>needed some time and space to like be able in opportunity obviously to do this, but like that right<br>there. Hits my original.<br>Holy crap. Can we have this? Can I have this? Mm-hmm. , I want this thing [00:56:00] because<br>Yeah. That&#8217;s super cool. But now some more, I, I heard what you were sayings like more all text.<br>If, if I, if I may though. So is the, em the image is cropped right here. Mm-hmm. . But there&#8217;s<br>white space. So is this the block takes up the whole thing.<br>So we, we would, we can&#8217;t do like Right. Justified or something like that.<br>Corey Maass: What? Right. These are things we need to, to work on. Okay. Add, yeah. These<br>are, and I, and the truth is, is, is I need more real world usage. Mm-hmm. and people telling me<br>what they need for me to know what to add. Okay. I mean, the, I think, you know, the, the easy<br>analogy is if you go at a regular image block,<br>Good luck figuring it out, cuz Gutenberg is confusing [00:57:00] as heck. Not that I&#8217;m cynical.<br>Um, but you&#8217;ve already got, uh, yeah, alignment. Um, what&#8217;s the little triangle next to it?<br>Oh, those filters. Mm-hmm. . So there&#8217;s, you know, like that&#8217;s where, you know, if people are<br>using them, if they want them, we can start adding stuff like that. And this is where, what we&#8217;ve<br>talked about, like we can, you know, we can start messing around with other stuff if, if people<br>want them, um, people need them.<br>You know, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re still currently at version 0 0 3, so,<br>Cory Miller: okay man, you can get lost in these settings. They&#8217;ve added a lot of the settings it<br>seems. . Mm-hmm. . So would we be able to take, I think somewhere along the way, you<br>mentioned you [00:58:00] looked at a current block and saw some opportunities here, but would<br>these, taking this block with some of these things like the filter, um, would be, we&#8217;d be able to<br>hook into that.<br>I mean essentially like fork? Fork.<br>Corey Maass: Yeah, I think so. I think so. Or ex extend it basically.<br>Yeah. See there&#8217;s your aspect ratios.<br>Cory Miller: This must have got a big update or I&#8217;ve never looked at it.<br>Corey Maass: Yeah.<br>And you know, and part of why it was, I loved your idea of. Doubling down on featured images is<br>none of these are available and, and are not at, at least as far as I know and are not available in<br>media library.[00:59:00]<br>But, so maybe we should do a session where we like, walk through these and, um, yeah. Begin<br>further. Seriously.<br>Wow.<br>Cory Miller: Okay.<br>That&#8217;s, yeah. We de I, I, I for sure need to do this because I had no<br>Corey Maass: idea.<br>People at watching are gonna be like, uh, yeah, it&#8217;s been there for six weeks.<br>Cory Miller: Now that, oh, you have to upload the image first. Okay. Or you have to get the<br>image.<br>Corey Maass: Sorry. Yeah. I think, I think especially, I especially think the alignment [01:00:00]<br>stuff, because that, that to me is version one, right? Like, you need an image, you need the</p>



<p>image to behave the way you want. Yeah. Shift left, shift right. Whatever. Um, and then getting<br>into this kind of stuff is, is gravy and is a rabbit hole.<br>Oh yeah. Like, you know, we can start again. I, I, I like that we set up a request for feedback.<br>Um, It would be nice if we started getting people using it cuz then they&#8217;d be like, oh, the default<br>block has such and such. Three, two, why don&#8217;t you have three, two, and go, okay, so let&#8217;s go<br>add three, two as a default preset aspect ratio.<br>And you know, or hey, we, you know, why doesn&#8217;t the image shift left sh you know, uh, or why<br>can&#8217;t I set widths? Okay, great. We&#8217;ll go add that. Mm-hmm. . [01:01:00]<br>Cory Miller: Okay. Maybe I need to play with that a little bit more. Um, yeah. Now, but standing<br>now you don&#8217;t wanna like best, uh, that we don&#8217;t have at the moment, but alignment, we&#8217;ve<br>already talked about that.<br>Having that, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s pretty cool. Cause you can go over here. Right, exactly. You know, all<br>that stuff. This is incredibly compelling to me. Um, because it&#8217;s kind of your way like. You know<br>how themes do this with your color settings. Mm-hmm. , but having some, I don&#8217;t, this is just a,<br>this is a pretty cool way to Dr.<br>Like, this is just this boring image just done with a little filter. Mm-hmm. , or they call these filters,<br>duotone filters. Yep. The filters are really interesting to me because you can make it like, it&#8217;s not<br>gonna be just another stock. Yours. Yeah. You kinda make it yours. Um, but I think now with the<br>Gutenberg plug, man, that&#8217;s the, [01:02:00] that&#8217;s the feature.<br>Um, I could get us to more installs. Um,<br>Corey Maass: I agree. Um, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d, I&#8217;d be curious why that&#8217;s not the right<br>word. How the core team and, you know, 500 volunteers, et cetera, landed on Duotone. Um,<br>mm-hmm. rather than something else, because it&#8217;s, you know, WordPress is at the whim of the<br>people who, who are involved.<br>So it&#8217;s like, did they ask for this? Did they want this? You know, did somebody like me come<br>along and go, oh, this is a neat thing, let&#8217;s add it. And everybody was like, yeah, it&#8217;s cool. We&#8217;ll<br>add it, you know, or people using it. I, which is, and that&#8217;s of course the black box, black box part<br>of WordPress is [01:03:00] we will never have any idea whether people are actually using<br>Duotone filters, um, et cetera.<br>I know that&#8217;s a bit of a cynical approach, but it&#8217;s like, I want to, I wanna make sure that we are<br>focused on. We want our own bumpers because it&#8217;s, you know, this is, this is the slippery slope<br>that I often fall into. It&#8217;s like, I trusted my gut when you were like, I need a circle. And I was like,<br>yeah, we need a circle.<br>But I don&#8217;t, my gut doesn&#8217;t jump when, when we say duotone filters unless, yeah. You know, but<br>unless we have compelling evidence that people are using them.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah. Well I think though the, the single po single block, the, the, the crop to image<br>block could be really that ticker for, uh, um, getting those active installs.<br>Um, and now we [01:04:00] need to switch to, I wanted to make sure we talked to that side<br>because, uh, you surprised me with it. I saw it in there and I was waiting. I was like, no, let him<br>talk about the settings. You&#8217;re like, go. Featured image or whatever, and I was like, I really want<br>to click on GI Berg Block by White<br>Corey Maass: Um, well, and that&#8217;s, I really, yeah. Uh, the block I think will evolve unto itself. It&#8217;ll<br>have those settings, right? Because your, your media library, even your featured image doesn&#8217;t<br>have left or right. A line, like that&#8217;s up to your theme, how it&#8217;s being used. Um, so, so the block<br>will start to evolve with additional settings.<br>Whatev, and we did, again, my gut jumps. Yes, we need alignment for sure. Um, you pointed out<br>yourself, you&#8217;re like, I uploaded a Lego man and he&#8217;s always aligned, left, like, that&#8217;s useless. So<br>immediately we need those, we need alignment. Um, and then I also want to start [01:05:00]<br>evolving the idea of, again, media library presets, meaning, you know, what kind of image do<br>you want to upload?<br>And, and again, and I, I start to get really excited about the idea of images that aren&#8217;t even<br>stored in the library. You&#8217;re going to, like media library implies, or we are taught by WordPress<br>that this is where we store images for WordPress. But why isn&#8217;t it just called media? And why<br>isn&#8217;t a place where you can go and edit an image and download it and it, and it has nothing to<br>do with WordPress.<br>And that&#8217;s exactly the, the sticker mule conversation we had. Mm-hmm. like utility, go to media.<br>Yeah. It&#8217;s a utility to go to media. And it&#8217;s not a media library or it&#8217;s not just a media library. It&#8217;s a</p>



<p>place where, you know, you can edit an image and then download it. So it&#8217;s like, yo, you just<br>created a post for.[01:06:00]<br>You know, a new post about the brownies, the brownies images image is already in there. Now<br>you need to create an image for Twitter, you need to create an image for Facebook, you need to<br>create a square image for Instagram. So jump into media, grab that image that&#8217;s already in the<br>media library, edited a bunch of times, maybe put a title over it.<br>Download the result. Again, doesn&#8217;t get uploaded to Media Library necessarily. And then now<br>you go over to your socials, or go into Buffer or whatever tool you use for scheduling your, you</p>



<p>know, multi broadcast to all of your socials and upload the appropriate image for each one. Mm-<br>hmm. . And that also diverges us from Word.</p>



<p>which I think is important, especially now seeing the default image. Like you said, I didn&#8217;t realize<br>half that stuff was in there. And so we are starting to overlap with them, [01:07:00] which I don&#8217;t<br>want to do. Like, what&#8217;s the point? If it&#8217;s built into core. I mean their, our original thesis was<br>within media library image cropping is awful and I&#8217;ve maintained that.<br>It still is. But if you can crop an image as quick as we can inside of a block, then, then maybe we<br>don&#8217;t need a block. What&#8217;s our differentiator there? But image manipulation elsewhere within<br>WordPress. Like right now, I would absolutely argue that our featured image handler is better<br>than the defaults.<br>And same with media library still. Mm-hmm. . Cause that, that&#8217;s that original crop. That&#8217;s awful.<br>So these are the things that we need to, to balance. Yeah. I,<br>Cory Miller: I mean, I still think the image blocking burg, the, the crop tool is just, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t<br>even know how to use it. Right. [01:08:00] Um,<br>Corey Maass: yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m not necessarily saying we, we rip, you know, I&#8217;m not<br>gonna go rip it out in version 0 0 4.<br>Mm-hmm. , but I don&#8217;t wanna, we don&#8217;t need to recreate that, which WordPress already does.<br>That&#8217;s silly. Yeah. Um, because, and, and I mean, to be like, there, there are plugins out there<br>that do core features better, and we can still do that. But that, that&#8217;s, that, uh, the me, the margin<br>is thin. The, the margin of value that we add is thin if the features are already there, whereas not<br>jumping over, having.<br>Create a post, a story, a page in WordPress, and then jump over to Canva to create your social<br>images. To me, the margin of value add is much larger. Mm-hmm. . So,<br>Cory Miller: yeah. I, I was just trying [01:09:00] to think about, you know, you look at,<br>you look at, like some of the sites we just looked at and you go, there&#8217;s a formula here for how<br>to create a good image. And<br>I would think like, like showing w beginner, for instance, they&#8217;re gonna need Camba or some<br>photo editing, graphic design software. Um, but there&#8217;s this case potentially for the output you<br>want is something like, like I just went to Medium for a second. And was kinda looking at a<br>couple of the articles.<br>Cause I go, you know, high readability, beautiful design, um, very standard. And, you know, I&#8217;m<br>looking at all these posts here and they all have, you know, an image and we know, we know it<br>would be better if you had the image. [01:10:00] Um, my, so I&#8217;m just kind of keeping thinking<br>about what&#8217;s the three value proposition, what&#8217;s the paid value proposition on this?<br>Mm-hmm. and what&#8217;s our space for this? Um, but I do think, like, here, here&#8217;s the, here&#8217;s one<br>part. There&#8217;s all, there&#8217;s this image block within Gate Burke and you go a lot of stuff, a lot of<br>people have thought through those things. A lot of options. Most people won&#8217;t even touch &#8217;em.<br>Mm-hmm. , you know, um, just, most people won&#8217;t touch &#8217;em because it&#8217;s too deep of tools.<br>But what, what are you really wanting? , you want a post that looks nice? Mm-hmm. like<br>attractive and the images help supplement the story. Mm-hmm. . Um, so I&#8217;m just kind of think<br>there with our angle, like we&#8217;re here and just kind of continuing to look at where, what&#8217;s our<br>angle for all this? Until we, until we kind of go, okay.<br>I think this is it. [01:11:00] Like we knew the agency settings case, we got that, we got the block,<br>then we discovered this other thing. And um, I just keep trying to think through like, if we can get<br>enough of a pattern of people that have this, have a problem, we can, it&#8217;ll really help us<br>crystallize the all this stuff.<br>Because you continually say, this is what I love working with awesome developers. We could do<br>that. Oh, by the way, I already did it. Here it is. And um, now we&#8217;ve got enough ingredients I<br>think. We need to nail that use case where, right.</p>



<p>Corey Maass: Yeah. We&#8217;ve got, we&#8217;ve got screwdrivers, we&#8217;ve got a hammer, we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve now<br>got the tool belt.<br>What the hell are we gonna build? Literally<br>Cory Miller: any, yeah, exactly. We need a person. I wrote this down as you were talking. I was<br>like, we need a person, you know, the, the, [01:12:00] the user in client, whatever that is, and<br>whether they want it, you go, I want it to speed it up, what I&#8217;m trying to do. Mm-hmm. Like if we<br>just looked at, because for the publishing conversation, you&#8217;re like, what do you really need?<br>You need to be able to get your content. You&#8217;re gonna do the text. That&#8217;s your thing when you&#8217;re<br>looking for the images. You want something that kind of fits a formula, like the WP beginner<br>formula medium, Moz, I looked at Moz, the bakery site. You&#8217;re like, that&#8217;s a, that&#8217;s a formula, a<br>pattern for how to do content.<br>So, mm-hmm. , some of this comes into the finding, but like I go, like that duotone use case, I&#8217;d<br>go, why not make every image of Duotone? It&#8217;s just something different. You know what I mean?<br>Like it&#8217;s something unique. So I might think through, and where I go back to my past is I like to<br>use templates for those things.<br>Mm-hmm. . [01:13:00] So I&#8217;m trying to keep that in mind for our product or what we&#8217;re doing is<br>the outcome they&#8217;re trying to get is really something that, like you look on medium and you go,<br>some people don&#8217;t. By and large, this just really works. It looks like a clean site. The images are<br>plusing, the value of the content, which I don&#8217;t ever do.<br>Um, We talked about the four threes, like that seems the standard in a lot of these posts. So I&#8217;m<br>really thinking for that user, the publisher user, um, and trying to build that case for the product<br>of what we&#8217;re doing. Um, mm-hmm. , because like I, I think about the filters and I go, um, I told<br>you, we, we talked about my cartoon app,<br>I&#8217;m like, now the problem when I write content is I don&#8217;t have an image in mind. Mm. So finding<br>an image is pain the butt, like, let&#8217;s put down, we have discovered a [01:14:00] problem. It is<br>finding, creating sourcing images that are good is a big problem. We haven&#8217;t, we haven&#8217;t, we&#8217;ve<br>just identified it&#8217;s just a problem.<br>We&#8217;re over here. Um, but like I go, if we had, it&#8217;s like Instagram. I can take, okay. I&#8217;ve got a<br>camera in my pocket, carry with me all the time. My iPhone, it lets me take pictures. What did<br>Instagram did? Make them look a little better. Mm-hmm. , you know, just a little bit better. And<br>that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s something in this where I think that this is what pulls me back to the duo turn thing,<br>is it doesn&#8217;t have to be due to, it&#8217;s just the, a aspect of Sure.<br>You know, how do I look like it&#8217;s not stock<br>Corey Maass: or Well, and that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not, I mean, that&#8217;s why AI is, is going running rampant, is<br>that people are like, I can now generate original art without paying for it, or paying nominally for<br>[01:15:00] it that nobody else has over and over and over again. Yeah. And that&#8217;s why people<br>are over the moon.<br>You know, obviously there&#8217;s no substitute for hiring a photographer to take pictures of products,<br>people, things like that. But if you need a. Abstract picture to just kind of add that compelling<br>human visual element. You&#8217;re like, generate a picture of I&#8217;m writing a post about coffee, so<br>generate a picture of a guy on a horse drinking a cup of coffee, you know, I don&#8217;t have to spend<br>hours.<br>The, the image will come to me and it&#8217;ll be unique and literally nobody else will have that.<br>Whereas, you know, the sites like stock, whatever, the stock photo, stock image sites historically<br>would charge you more. You could go buy an image, you could pay, you know, a thousand times<br>more for them to take it off the site to guarantee that nobody else ever used it again.<br>[01:16:00] Right. Um, that&#8217;s not a, that&#8217;s not gonna be an issue for much longer, you know?<br>Cory Miller: Um, it&#8217;s not Will it? Okay. So something you said, I wrote down here, I was like,<br>nobody else has it. See. Like we, we are looking at the, I&#8217;m gonna share my screen again. Do<br>you have a second to keep talking about<br>Corey Maass: this? Yeah, let&#8217;s<br>Cory Miller: go 10 more minutes.<br>Um, okay, so Rolling Stone. I don&#8217;t have a, the Desi design ability, I don&#8217;t have the resources to<br>create this, this thing now with ai, is there that opportunity That&#8217;s mm-hmm. . That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s really<br>interesting. But that&#8217;s a sidebar. Yep. But like, you think about this now, for now, when I look at<br>this site, I go, this is thoughtful.</p>



<p>Like this is unique. It&#8217;s interesting. Like this, Ima I didn&#8217;t even read what this is, but I [01:17:00]<br>was like, it it fits, you know, the, the case and cuz what you&#8217;re trying to, I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m just trying<br>to keep talking about the use case. Here is what you&#8217;re trying to get is. , you know, back to<br>beginner, like, hey, nice sight, nice clean, clear side design.<br>They&#8217;re trying to get you to the content. So they&#8217;re doing a great job with SEO here with the<br>intro, restating what the headline&#8217;s about. Then they use the image, which I think is clever. Like,<br>I don&#8217;t like the featured image going outside of the post because it just fills out a whack for me.<br>But I&#8217;m like, this is interesting.<br>They have given an image that probably, you know, uh, this has SEO in it, you know? Mm-hmm.<br>, I, I, I would guess, look at this. They&#8217;ve restated, they&#8217;ve restated again, the headline.<br>Corey Maass: Yeah. Well, and that&#8217;s that also, that image is [01:18:00] gonna be, um, usable<br>for social. Right. If picture that as a, as a Facebook post it, it says their headline right int it.<br>Cory Miller: Okay, now, now, now you got got me something here. Okay. So may not go<br>anywhere, but the social share side, you&#8217;ve done all of this work to create some kind of content<br>and that social share, like our stuff from post status. I hate it because it&#8217;s not something we don&#8217;t<br>have set up. Right? You know? But what you want is, I&#8217;ve just done this cool post here that<br>hopefully is of interest to you and you&#8217;re using the image in social to pull somebody into it.<br>It&#8217;s kinda like this, almost like this. Well, or who is the<br>Freemius or are they, there [01:19:00] you go. Like if you look at this from a social Sears<br>standpoint, it&#8217;s probably more interesting. Visually, you can kind of say, I see Covid and I see<br>some kinda like weird things around it. Mm-hmm. , right? But I go, it&#8217;s something to do with<br>Covid, like from a social share. That&#8217;s pretty good.<br>Like that&#8217;s what you&#8217;d want represented out on social is it&#8217;s uh, it&#8217;s the product packaging to say,<br>there&#8217;s something in here I want and to go get it. We talked a little bit about that yo side, but<br>man, all of that social sharing stuff is just a mess. Like when I post my, I should do it here when I<br>post my, let me show you something.<br>If you have a second. If I go into to Slack and I&#8217;m gonna, then I&#8217;m gonna try to share this so you<br>can see it. Okay. Maybe this has [01:20:00] been fixed, but this thing right.<br>This, this little snippet that&#8217;s now fixed. I don&#8217;t, oh, it&#8217;s cuz I clicked the social share stuff. But<br>see, like when you do<br>any day now<br>Okay. Anyway, it doesn&#8217;t look good. Like it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not, there we go. Yeah, sure. Okay. So<br>somehow this, this has attached to the homepage, right? But the idea that you want is, it<br>represents that f. Social share, whatever the image thing, whatever we titled it, feature name or<br>whatever it is, like that, whatever [01:21:00] this, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s graphical or whatever it&#8217;s<br>called.<br>But, um, what you&#8217;re trying to do when you post that to social is show this effect of what, like, w<br>if you beginner on different things, designs, like here&#8217;s something to show you see, show you<br>what this post is about. That&#8217;s an interesting angle, but I, I don&#8217;t know where it goes from here,<br>but like,<br>Corey Maass: so like here&#8217;s, here&#8217;s a tool that I&#8217;ve been playing around with lately is, uh, so<br>Twitter has introduced cards the same way that Facebook a while ago introduced their open<br>graph. So you come here and you plug in post status and you say preview card. Card preview<br>has moved to tweet composer . Okay. Uh, but we can do tweet card preview banner bear.<br>So if I [01:22:00] plug in post status, they built their own preview. There you go. So like, that&#8217;s<br>what it&#8217;s gonna look like on social.<br>And these are the tools, you know, that are becoming more and more prevalent. And it&#8217;s like, so<br>in Yeah, in Yost, using them as an example, and I think the other SEO plugins have this too, is<br>you, you know, you, you set your featured image and it will automatically suck in your featured<br>image as the OG image, but you can also set a different one.<br>And so you can go and, and so like, I actually wanted to do just what you said, um, previous and<br>go to their blog and pick a blog post. . And so like this is, uh, I&#8217;m breaking their site, [01:23:00]<br>so they&#8217;ve got an image in the background. This is text, you know, an H one or whatever. But,<br>um, you know, VVA is so phenomenal with social media and stuff like that, that I bet if I take this<br>U R L and I plug it in here and I hit enter that he&#8217;s created.<br>Yeah. See, so he&#8217;s created a custom image that is that same background image, but has his<br>little photo in it has a title, you know, and this is all one image that is been generated Canva,</p>



<p>somewhere different from, you know, the, the title up here. Whereas this is all actually H T M L<br>element.<br>Yeah, food for thought and, and actually a conversation to take offline, um, is there are features<br>here that, um, [01:24:00] overlap with other stuff that I&#8217;ve been working on. And so maybe it&#8217;s,<br>maybe we wanna wrap it all in together, or maybe this is a different kind of like the, you know,<br>we keep talking around ai, but we&#8217;re just not, that&#8217;s not the product we&#8217;re building this year, let&#8217;s<br>say.<br>Unless it, it, it&#8217;s the on unless we get to the point where it&#8217;s the only thing we can build. Right.<br>Um, and so it&#8217;s, maybe it&#8217;s something like that or maybe it&#8217;s the direction that we we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re<br>talking about, I dunno. Mm-hmm.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah. Now you got my mind rolling.<br>Corey Maass: Yep. Um, I gotta get. Okay. I do think that we need bringing, bringing you way<br>back down . Um, I mean, and I&#8217;m not picking on you, both of us, like these are our<br>conversations, but [01:25:00] um, I think having you go through the plugin and just saying, look,<br>we need, this needs a little design or this needs some intro text, or what the heck is the word<br>preset mean?<br>Um, would take us pretty far. Cuz right now we do have a very developer friendly product. And<br>so me going in and just changing some labels and things, if that makes it 20% more usable,<br>which I think is true, um, then, then we&#8217;re gonna be better off. The other thing is the Readme<br>needs updating now because we have a block.<br>We have featured images, we have. Media library. We have some basic settings. Okay. So let&#8217;s,<br>you know, I, I, I think we&#8217;re having, in a good way, we&#8217;re having all of the different company<br>meetings in one . We&#8217;re having the executive level discussions, [01:26:00] which are arguably<br>way more fun, but we also need to be having the, you know, low level mm-hmm.<br>dev, you know, dev conversations to make sure that we keep moving, moving what we&#8217;ve got<br>forward, um, in a, in a practical sense. Mm-hmm. .<br>Cory Miller: Yep. Okay. Well I&#8217;ve got down here, review the plugin. I&#8217;ll do a video on that, walk<br>through several things and just note stuff.<br>Corey Maass: Hi puppy. Um, your background changed. How did I take this long to even<br>notice?<br>Cory Miller: Yeah, I know, right? I got the fancy new sleeper.<br>Corey Maass: So it&#8217;s so respectable now. Don&#8217;t go that far<br>Cory Miller: yet. . I do. I think, I think, I&#8217;ll tell you what, I need a big poster right over there. Yeah.<br>Um, yeah. Looking respectable, man. What can you say?<br>Corey Maass: I&#8217;m proud of you, buddy. Thank you, . [01:27:00]<br>Cory Miller: Um, and then I&#8217;ve got the read me file too.<br>Um, to go back to Yeah. And I<br>Corey Maass: think that for me, like we now have Yeah. Read, read Me as you, um, or us like<br>we, we did it together last time. We can do it again. Um, I, I guess what I&#8217;m envisioning right is<br>we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re pretty close to feature, complete, um, Or something that&#8217;s actually usable. Like I&#8217;m,<br>I&#8217;m on the verge of actually installing this on my client&#8217;s websites.<br>I&#8217;ve got it on some of my own cuz I&#8217;m willing to muddle through the things that were confusing<br>or, um, you know, or, or not clear or, um, that&#8217;s redundant, um, or not what I needed. Whereas<br>now I&#8217;m like, okay, my clients have to upload a 16.9 featured image every day and currently they<br>have to go use a separate tool.<br>I&#8217;m ready to install this [01:28:00] plugin cuz it actually does what I need. Um, and so I wanna<br>make sure that we are. Product complete. So Dev builds the features and then we as a team<br>have complete the product. And then frankly, we can sit on it for a long time and keep having<br>more of these conversations or ex, you know, start from there.<br>It&#8217;s like we&#8217;ve built the dock out into the lake and so then we can start dipping our toe in more,<br>but mm-hmm. , we&#8217;re, you know, we&#8217;re out there, we&#8217;re in the world. Um, and, and people, other<br>people can use the dock too. I feel like right now we&#8217;ve got the, uh, the, the janky, uh, we&#8217;re, it&#8217;s<br>a, it&#8217;s a wooden pallet floating on empty beer cans.<br>And so we wouldn&#8217;t allow our loved ones to go use it to get out into the lake. Yes, I&#8217;m running<br>with this metaphor. You know, we&#8217;re close to having actually swimming built a reasonable dock.<br>Um, you know, that&#8217;s safe enough for our, for children to [01:29:00] use that kind of thing.<br>Cory Miller: You&#8217;re swimming with that metaphor.</p>



<p>Sta. All right. Thanks man. Um, okay. Yeah, I&#8217;ve got my team marching items. Thanks for<br>keeping us grounded. Let me, uh, float in the atmosphere a little bit. I, it really is for specific<br>reasons cause I know when we go Got it. You know, like right there and, and some of that&#8217;s<br>validation, but just a little bit more clarity on how, who is gonna value this and is it the right thing<br>for what they need.<br>Um, but Okay. Thanks dude. Thanks for jumping on today. All right.</p>

<p><a href="#h-transcript">Transcript</a> ↓</p>



<p>Learn from <a href="https://twitter.com/coreymaass">Corey Maass</a>, the go-to on WordPress product design topics, and <a href="https://twitter.com/corymiller303">Cory Miller</a>, a master on the business of WordPress. They discuss finding the balance in the small and big pictures of product development, highlighting the process of trial and error.</p>



<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Courage Under Fire.</strong> After what feels like a miserable failure, it’s vital to keep trudging forward. Great product design takes time to build and grow in the space you are putting it into. Keeping your passion alive and remaining consistent in your efforts will eventually lead you to success.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>The Impact of Thoughtful Design.</strong> Developing a product is, of course, based on meeting some kind of user need, but it’s important to consider if you are going to make that user’s life easier with your product. When the end user is your top priority, your product will shine, and you’ll be proud of your direct impact on someone’s everyday life. </li>



<li><strong>Finding the Spark in Your Product.</strong> Focusing on the overall product journey is key for great product development, but zooming in on the minor details is equally important. Brainstorming and finding the spark is not easy, but setting your product apart from the rest is crucial. </li>



<li><strong>Using Your Audience to Improve Development</strong>. Put your ideas and questions out there for your audience to speak to. If you are wondering how people will perceive a certain product aspect or want more information on their exact pain points, it’s good to ask directly. Getting information straight from your customers or peers can help you make well-informed decisions in product development.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="eplus-wrapper wp-block-heading" id="h-transcript">Transcript</h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Session 7 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>



<p>Corey Maass: [00:00:00] So now I&#8217;m following along. I&#8217;ve gotten in the habit of. I opened the<br>YouTube, which is, well, it&#8217;s live, which is really disorienting cuz of course I&#8217;m talking, uh, 10<br>seconds ago or 10 seconds in the future. And then grab the chat and then close it as fast as I<br>can,<br>because it seems that people do ask us questions, but mostly on YouTube, not on, uh, the<br>webinar, the Zoom webinar.<br>Cory Miller: Um, sorry, I was just trying to get all that going. Um, yeah, speaking of what we&#8217;re<br>talking about today in the marketing channel with post status, there&#8217;s some good conversations<br>about product. Hmm. I was like, you know, there&#8217;s enough of this going around that we, um,<br>should we have more conversations about product and marketing.<br>And [00:01:00] channels.<br>Corey Maass: Um, I have to go find, I&#8217;ve got, um, I&#8217;m in product owner and I&#8217;m in a couple of<br>others, but I&#8217;m not in marketing. Oh, okay. You&#8217;re already in here. Yeah. Product leaders I&#8217;m in.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah. Um, I really want that product leaders channel to. This type of, you know,<br>conversation, whatever it has to do with product, you know?<br>Right.<br>Corey Maass: So, yeah, and it&#8217;s, I mean, it&#8217;s a popular topic. Like I, I was on Twitter five<br>minutes ago and somebody was asking like, who is marketing WordPress plugins? Well these<br>days? And of course was scrolling the answers to see who to follow or what examples to look at,<br>or, you know, there&#8217;s, I mean, a few known quantities.<br>Um, and articles and, and references and stuff, but well, you know, [00:02:00] year to year and,<br>and new products that will cause blips and, and whatnot. Yeah. Um, you know, because it&#8217;s<br>definitely still not a. You know, not a known thing. I mean, marketing anything is not, is never<br>necessarily reliable. But, uh, marketing a WordPress plugin.<br>There are people who are very successful with WordPress plugins, but I don&#8217;t know that the<br>marketing is, it&#8217;s not a solved problem. You know,<br>Cory Miller: I think we said this a lot, but I really love product. Um, but it feels like. Almost like<br>gambling, you know? Um, like this one, I continue to see there&#8217;s something here and we say<br>this, we don&#8217;t know what it is and we&#8217;re trying to kinda keep stepping into it.<br>But gosh, I&#8217;ve tried a bunch of products between I themes and today, you know, bunch of<br>different things. And they weren&#8217;t like [00:03:00] pure software products of course. Um, but.<br>Every time I talk about product, I realize how much I have to learn .<br>Corey Maass: Um, so there&#8217;s, um, they&#8217;re the people who I, I&#8217;m not gonna even try to mention<br>names, but it&#8217;s like, there are, there are people who are famous for breaking the land speed<br>record, you know, or the like, uh, What was his name?<br>Hopkins was in the, a movie called The Indian, and it was his, about his motorcycle or you know,<br>there&#8217;s nascar, like there&#8217;s the people who win over year, over year. And, and then there&#8217;s,<br>there&#8217;s gotta be the people who were fascinating, you know, they, they worked a, a regular job<br>and they spent every night and weekend working on, you know, Build, trying to build the fastest<br>[00:04:00] race car or the fastest motorcycle and, and have absolutely died in obscurity, , you<br>know, like, they just never, they d take a, take a motorcycle out to the flats, crash it, start over<br>again, you know, and, and have done it.<br>Or did it, you know, for 30 years or whatever, and, and we&#8217;re never gonna hear about any of<br>those people, you know, or they consistently came in third and we&#8217;re never gonna hear about<br>any of those people. Yeah. And it&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m a while ago, I had to th there was a time in my life<br>where I was absolutely convinced that I was going to be a rockstar dj, where I was going to be<br>the gazillion.<br>Uh, entrepreneur or, and I still would love to be all those things. Well, I don&#8217;t know if I have the<br>energy anymore, but Me too. Um, you know, um, but it, they were, they were tied into my<br>identity and they were like constant. You know, a need and would keep me up at night. And now<br>I&#8217;m like, I [00:05:00] have, I think part of middle age is accepting your mediocrity.</p>



<p>Um, and, and just going, you know, okay, if, if I&#8217;m, if I&#8217;m successful, if I&#8217;m having some fun and<br>I&#8217;m successful enough that I&#8217;m not, Uh, starving, you know, then, then that&#8217;s then and, and then<br>it&#8217;s fun to keep trying, you know, and, and on my deathbed, it, it&#8217;s still probably gonna hurt that I<br>didn&#8217;t, you know, uh, headline, uh, you know, some huge music festival or something, but, uh,<br>but at least I tried, I suppose<br>Cory Miller: I, I love that. Thank you for sharing that. Um, you know, because I, I totally. , um, in<br>so many ways. I feel like I had my time. Mm-hmm. , you know, I got my opportunity and I made,<br>I made the most of it. I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m proud of it, you know, uh, and that, that was a [00:06:00] very<br>magical period for me. You know? But when you&#8217;re talking, have you seen the Netflix?<br>It made me think of the Netflix special full swing. It&#8217;s about golf. So, I know you golf. I don&#8217;t, I put<br>putt golf, you know, but, um, even though we have a son named Callaway, everybody thinks we<br>named it after a golf club. And I&#8217;m like, no, sorry, , um, him out after a golf club. But, okay, so this<br>last episode, there&#8217;s a guy, and you may name, you may know his name, and I&#8217;m like, I, if, if<br>there were jerseys in golf, I&#8217;m not a.<br>I would go buy his jersey today. He&#8217;s like the 70th best. Mm-hmm. golfer in the world. His name<br>is Joel Drum. I can&#8217;t remember. I&#8217;ll f I&#8217;ll find his name. So the first episode, have you seen this?<br>Mm-hmm. . Okay. You, I think you&#8217;d be interested. I&#8217;m like you said. Full swing. Full swing. It&#8217;s a<br>documentary about the [00:07:00] PGA.<br>I&#8217;m morbidly curious about sports because I think it has so many parallels. Anyway, so the first<br>two were like, the brand names Justin Thomas, uh, Jordan Sp, and now I know those names<br>well, but I was familiar with their names. Sure. And like they&#8217;re at the top pinnacle of the sport.<br>Then the third episode is, is is Joel, and he&#8217;s basically like, I&#8217;m okay being seven.<br>like he&#8217;s got immense talent. Um, his caddy, everybody&#8217;s like, no, he&#8217;s a top 30 golfer. And he&#8217;s<br>just kinda like, you know, he&#8217;s, he could be like, he won, he&#8217;s won, but like, he could be even<br>better. But he&#8217;s just like, k he feels like almost resigned contend of being like 70th. And I. Maybe<br>I&#8217;m okay being like 500th best or five thousandths best at being an entrepreneur, being a<br>product person, right?<br>Um, [00:08:00] I am morbidly attracted to entrepreneurship and product. Like I think you and I<br>resonate with this. Like every time I hear you talk, man, I would go. Rather from another mother,<br>like he, you know,<br>Corey Maass: I could have said those words or have had or have said those words. Yeah,<br>exactly.<br>Cory Miller: But I think there&#8217;s something resonating here, Corey.<br>It&#8217;s the esteem that I, I&#8217;m gonna talk by myself. The esteem I might talk about, like iconic,<br>everybody says it, Steve, let me invoke his name. Steve Jobs right now, first time around, I<br>think. Right time, right place, and of course genius, you know, but right time, right place, right.<br>Critical thing got kicked out of Apple, comes back and doing it again, and we always talk about<br>him.<br>Right. You know, maybe, maybe Elon Musk in my mind before he started doing, just, I don&#8217;t<br>know. Um, he, I think he went too far. He overreach. But anyway, but I go, God, [00:09:00] I&#8217;d<br>love to have that kind of genius for product for. and, but selling down in Maine, like you were<br>saying about middle, middle age and Meoc, just going, Hey, I think I got some talent , you know,<br>but mainly I just work my ass off.<br>Mm-hmm.<br>Corey Maass: I&#8217;m one of those, try things and try things.<br>Cory Miller: I feel like one of those sports players, like if we use that metaphor analogy,<br>whatever it is, and I. Never gonna be number one. Mm-hmm. never gonna be top 50. But for my<br>brand of those, I&#8217;m really content with who I am. You know? Right. Even though I&#8217;m just like,<br>God, it feels like with product it&#8217;s miserable Failure.<br>Miserable failure. Miserable failure. Miserable failure. When 2008, man, I felt like I&#8217;m gonna mix<br>all these sports things, get up to the plate, ball&#8217;s coming, [00:10:00] and I hit it. And I get into the<br>field<br>Corey Maass: and you scored a touchdown<br>Cory Miller: and . Yes. And a hole in one and you know, let me find another sport so I can do it.<br>But you don&#8217;t end up in the gutter.<br>I think the reality is, yeah, , I need bumpers for my bowling entrepreneur, bowling, and there you<br>go. Product person. I need some bumpers. I feel like sometimes, and I&#8217;m glad I. I couldn&#8217;t laugh</p>



<p>about this a couple years ago at all. Hmm. I&#8217;d be like, what? I have magic. I&#8217;m supposed to be<br>magic. I&#8217;m supposed to come.<br>Right. You know, and then you&#8217;re like, maybe not . It&#8217;s the humbling effect of that. Yep. And I<br>think when you come down to it, you go, I think the reason why I&#8217;m so interested in product is<br>like it&#8217;s a gift. It should be like this cool gift that you&#8217;re trying to help someone. Make somebody&#8217;s<br>life better and in the process be [00:11:00] able to do it vocationally and get paid for it.<br>Yeah. And man, I love that about work, you know, and products specifically is like tie to this little<br>bow, here&#8217;s your present and I&#8217;m trying to get better about this is I&#8217;m trying to offer a gift that you<br>pay for. Of course. You know, like those win-win things. But I digress.<br>Corey Maass: Yeah, it&#8217;s, I love solving a problem.<br>I love the, like, this is gonna sound weird, but I love the angles of it. Like the, uh, moving through<br>a problem, uh, like screens and inner, like, I, I want to feel clever for having built it, like build a<br>better mouse trap. But I also want, that&#8217;s a bad analogy cuz a mouse, mouse uses a mouse<br>trap. But it&#8217;s like, I, I wanna build, you know, the, the better.<br>Thing that other people then get pleasure out of using to, again, to [00:12:00] solve a problem.<br>Um, and so then I feel smart. And they feel smart. And, and it&#8217;s like, to me it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s one of the<br>epitome of the human condition is, is solving problems, is manipulating the space around us.<br>And, um, and so yeah, product just absolutely.<br>Resonated with me early on. Which is funny because I think I, and a lot of, a lot of developers<br>and a lot of product people also are passionate about music in one way or another, which is the<br>opposite. It&#8217;s so abstract. It can mean anything to anybody. It&#8217;s totally subjective, uh, as opposed<br>to like, In the world we live in, like there&#8217;s a little bit of subjectivity.<br>Like there&#8217;s, you know, there&#8217;s a reason why there&#8217;s a million to-do list apps because everybody<br>solves it slightly differently or wants it to feel slightly different. But it&#8217;s still, uh, you know, there&#8217;s<br>still ones that objectively don&#8217;t [00:13:00] work. , uh, uh, But anyway. Yeah, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s<br>interesting.<br>It&#8217;s, I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s now a hobby rather than, uh, something that I, that I&#8217;m relying on. Cuz I<br>remember building, I think I&#8217;ve talked about this before, like, I remember building things because<br>I was like, I&#8217;m not gonna make rent if this doesn&#8217;t succeed. And of course it didn&#8217;t come close to<br>succeeding. I don&#8217;t even think I was able to finish it cuz it was like, I can&#8217;t make a logical<br>decision.<br>From a position of desperation, like some people can mm-hmm. , but I just, I can&#8217;t, I have to like<br>sit in it and splash around. Which is also why, because I think maybe it was another Twitter<br>conversation I was having, but, um, I, I often. Will. Oh, so yeah, somebody, somebody asked<br>like, do you, do you do any planning or do you jump right in?<br>I&#8217;m like, I a hundred percent jump right in, just like you, you keep saying like, there&#8217;s something<br>here. I often jump right in when I just, my gut [00:14:00] tells me that there&#8217;s something here<br>and, uh, Because I&#8217;m finding, and this is, I was noticing this again over the weekend. Um, the<br>setting screen that I wanna show you is like, I had to start building the setting screen in order for<br>me to go, oh, no, this setting isn&#8217;t right, or, we don&#8217;t need this, or This is better organized a<br>different way.<br>But I had to like, and I suppose I could put pen to paper and come to the sum of the same<br>conclusions, but for me, pen to paper is usually writing. You know, some, some aspect of code<br>to, so that I&#8217;m clicking on a button or I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m starting to fill in a screen or I&#8217;m even at this point, I<br>can just look at a screen and be like, no, this isn&#8217;t what we need, or this isn&#8217;t intuitive, or, um, no.<br>With that said, what I&#8217;ve designed is quite ugly. Um, I was futzing around. Information<br>architecture, and I don&#8217;t know why I was bothering, it was Sunday. I was having fun. Um, but<br>anyway, yeah, it&#8217;s, uh, there&#8217;s, [00:15:00] there&#8217;s definitely a difference of, of, for me anyway, like<br>getting in and actually clicking on things.<br>Cory Miller: It&#8217;s uh, when you say, when you said hobby, it reset me back to me going, is this,<br>should this really be a hobby for me? You know? Hmm. Um, cuz. I gotta tell you, I&#8217;ve, I<br>presented my business group about a week or two ago, and I was like, yeah, I don&#8217;t know. I<br>don&#8217;t know if I keep going. You know, back to middle age mediocrity, whatever it is, it&#8217;s like, I,<br>you know, we&#8217;re trying to do some things with post status and it&#8217;s been one frustration after the<br>other hitting walls.</p>



<p>I think that&#8217;s starting to loosen up, maybe with my own growth, you know? Okay. But like, just<br>trying to make progress on stuff where I had a team previously and now we&#8217;re trying, you know,<br>put stuff together. But that&#8217;s the bigger business. But down product too is like, you know, I think<br>there was a hope in me that you launch it and everybody&#8217;s like, hell yes.[00:16:00]<br>You know? Yeah. There&#8217;s more to it, you know? I just wanted people to instantly love it.<br>Corey Maass: Well, and starting from scratch is freaking hard. I mean, you were, you were on<br>a, a winning team. You were, you know, you were on a, a bus with a group of people. You&#8217;d built<br>the bus. You got the bus moving, and then you were hurling down the highway successfully.<br>And it&#8217;s real easy to forget that, like, oh, right. When we were building the bus, nobody cared.<br>And when the bus, the wheels first started moving, nobody cared. Now they do. And so yeah, if<br>you are, you know, leveraging something, if you&#8217;re building a trailer onto a bus that&#8217;s already<br>moving, that&#8217;s different than getting off the bus, chilling for a couple of years and then starting to<br>build another bus, you know?<br>Weird, weird analogy, but ,<br>Cory Miller: no, no, no. I like the bus thing cuz that&#8217;s how it was. I was like, I. I don&#8217;t, I get credit,<br>but I try not to ever take it and [00:17:00] be sure to point it in other ways. Like it was very much<br>a band back to music. I like, this is like, we&#8217;re a band that makes great music together. You<br>know, somehow it&#8217;s working, you know?<br>Yeah. And I can&#8217;t really take credit for a lot of that. I was, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I contributed, I<br>impacted it, but it was a magic of. Yeah, things flying together with it. And I think I&#8217;ve been trying<br>to ree that magic, you know, particularly with product. Um, but the word that comes up for me,<br>and I&#8217;m curious what your thoughts about this are, like de detachment, detachment from my<br>brilliant ideas, Corey, like, man, I&#8217;m very attached to my brilliant ideas, you know, and like here I<br>go.<br>How to detach from that pride aspect and then go just kinda lean into like passion and interest,<br>which is what your pace and how you [00:18:00] approach This has been really healthy for me<br>because you&#8217;re kinda like, I&#8217;m having fun doing it today. I&#8217;m having it and then tomorrow having<br>fun doing it and it. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s taking some box for you.<br>And I&#8217;m like, I need to be just okay with like, it&#8217;s taking a box for me. Now when I am working<br>with a developer partner, , I&#8217;m like, I wanna talk to you about filters. I wanna talk to you about all<br>these things. Cuz like I had, like all the stuff that we could do with images. I&#8217;ve been planning<br>around with stuff and wanting, been wanting to go like, you know, Instagram revolutionized<br>photos, for instance.<br>I think it, it took the iPhone or the smartphone, whatever it is, and made most anybody a pretty<br>decent photographer, right? Like, you know, Photoshop, you could do the Gazi blur and you can<br>kind of filter and like make things a little like correct stuff with Instagram. I did that and I&#8217;m like, I,<br>I love that.<br>I love taking photos. I&#8217;ve been taken. [00:19:00] So this is a weird sidebar onto the product by.<br>But I&#8217;ve been, um, you know, there&#8217;s those cartoon apps that&#8217;ll take a photo and make a cartoon<br>of it. Yep. I&#8217;m a freaking geek about cartoon illustration, all that stuff. So what I&#8217;ve been doing,<br>this is gonna lead back to product, by the way, an actual question on our product future.<br>And you can say, Hey, can we pause that? Can we hold that later? But, so I&#8217;ve been taking, I<br>love taking pictures of sunsets, you know, and I. So I&#8217;ve been taking my sunset pictures and<br>putting &#8217;em into my cartoon app. . Mm-hmm. nice. Yeah. And making these really things. But the<br>premise here was, you know, back to our philosophical conversations about images and the<br>web and on a website, and I go, you know, with ai, there&#8217;s a, that mix in there too, but I go, that&#8217;s<br>interesting to me.<br>Like for, for, for our product perspective is like, there&#8217;s cool things going on. I think we could be<br>creative and innovate downstream a bit in this [00:20:00] market. While I&#8217;m kinda like really<br>impatient, but trying to be patient about getting to the stage of like, I want somebody to pay for<br>it. I want somebody to give some validation to go, okay, should we put a little bit more time and<br>effort and money into this?<br>You know? Right. But anyway, the filtered conversation was where I&#8217;ve been going as we&#8217;ve<br>been talking, going man, You would know, but like are there libraries and stuff that we can do<br>filters or something different to make things just a little nicer in the pro side? Yeah, that I just<br>freaking love, like I&#8217;m such a geek Corey about that.</p>



<p>But I take my picture and then I share it over to whatever the tune app is and I really like, I don&#8217;t<br>know, it&#8217;s kind of fun. There&#8217;s gotta be . I can&#8217;t help, this is my idealism. There&#8217;s gotta be<br>something. On this other side when we start being able to get to the pro side. Okay.<br>Corey Maass: Looking for the other, the other app, there&#8217;s one that, um, I got really into a<br>[00:21:00] couple years ago.<br>That&#8217;s, um, it&#8217;ll, it&#8217;ll take any photo and basically make it a painting Yes. In a bunch of different<br>styles. Yes. Because there was a, a woman at the la in the, uh, woman who posted on<br>Facebook this like really cute watercolor painting of a farmhouse. And then I noticed at the<br>bottom that there was a watermark of the app that she&#8217;d used.<br>And I was like, oh crap. She just took a picture of a farmhouse and ran it through this little, you<br>know, 99 cent app and then had. Like a watercolor that I would&#8217;ve put on the wall, you know?<br>Um,<br>Cory Miller: see that, that, that&#8217;s like the heart of publishing for me is expression, and I&#8217;m very<br>much an amateur photographer that flunk photography twice, by the way, in college. But I go,<br>Corey Maass: you forgot to do that. No, the, the cover, the lens cover off . Yes, yes.<br>Cory Miller: I know what depth to field is, but I&#8217;m like, The manual. Mm-hmm. cameras I had to<br>use suck. But all that to say [00:22:00] like this is interesting and that&#8217;s a hobby of mine and so I<br>would say it&#8217;s a hobby of mine. It&#8217;s taking these photos.<br>I even had my son do it while I was driving. I was like, could you take a picture of that sentence?<br>Yeah,<br>Corey Maass: yeah, I do. It&#8217;s one more thing. We have the same of, you need to look at my<br>Instagram. It&#8217;s literally just sky pictures. That&#8217;s<br>Cory Miller: so, okay. This is called Tune. But yeah, let&#8217;s see<br>Corey Maass: here. Oh, it does it live? It Does it live?<br>Oh, that&#8217;s cool. I assumed it was like, it had to be a photo, but it, it actually applies the filter while<br>you&#8217;re moving the photo.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah. So I was like, that&#8217;s wild. And then they&#8217;ve got impressionism, they&#8217;ve got all<br>these filters and I go, right, you know, there&#8217;s something about Instagram having, yeah, I, I don&#8217;t<br>know, 10, 15 filters.<br>I always use like the first six. Sure. You know, but it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s something about that taking<br>something, making it, just dressing it up a little bit and being able to put it out there. Like I&#8217;ve<br>been playing with the tune stuff on the colors cuz it really pulls [00:23:00] out some of the sunset<br>photos and stuff and I go, I hope there&#8217;s something there on this pro.<br>I want it. You know what I mean? Like I want something that just<br>Corey Maass: I conceptually, I think. You&#8217;re onto something. I mean, again, go, what&#8217;s our<br>mantra? You know, making creative tasks simpler, easier, fun. And so we&#8217;re starting with what<br>we&#8217;re hoping is the widest base. Everybody needs to crop an image and get it into WordPress.<br>Um, and then. So I, my Instagram, again, I&#8217;m fascinated, I&#8217;m captivated by mostly cloud shapes<br>and especially sunlight coming through the clouds. But I didn&#8217;t want to, I, I was never. Really<br>impressed with filters. Like they&#8217;re neat for doing different things, but I didn&#8217;t, they didn&#8217;t do what<br>I wanted. And so what I [00:24:00] actually do is, um, because I noticed that the, whatever it is,<br>the polarization from my sunglasses, Make things more distinct.<br>So I usually take my sunglasses off and then take a picture through the lens, and that&#8217;s my real<br>world filter, so to speak. Right. But it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s my style. Nobody knows I&#8217;m doing it, but<br>that&#8217;s stylistically. Right. And so I imagine that, uh, a lot of people like. They, they have their feed<br>and so they have their favorite one or two filters and they think of it in part as their branding.<br>Um, and maybe it&#8217;s the same with blogs where it&#8217;s like, oh, if I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m blogging week over week,<br>whatever photo, I&#8217;m gonna give it the same treatment. Um, you know, even if that means, it&#8217;s not<br>necessarily some manipulation of the photo, but I put. My own watermark, or I put the title of the<br>blog post in a certain font with a certain background.<br>You know, [00:25:00] there&#8217;s a treatment so that you know when it&#8217;s shared. It&#8217;s the same with<br>the OG images, which is why I&#8217;m so fascinated by those. Um, and that&#8217;s the other plugin that I<br>keep messing around with as generating social images. But it&#8217;s the idea of being, again, that<br>same sort of the concept of set it and forget it, but so, Um, so the, another, another word that we<br>should somehow incorporate into one or another of our sort of overarching rules here is<br>consistency, which we&#8217;ve talked about.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s like, but, but taking that, like all of your images should be 16, nine, but taking it much further<br>so that it&#8217;s all of your images should be watermarked the same way, or they should have some.<br>You know, coherent look and feel so that I land on any page on your blog and, and I know where<br>I am or if I see an image on, in, you know, I&#8217;m scrolling Twitter and I&#8217;m like, oh, there&#8217;s another<br>one of Corey&#8217;s photos.<br>Because it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s [00:26:00] a, it&#8217;s a sunset, but it&#8217;s got the, the comic book treatment, you know,<br>so whatever, whatever it is, like, um, I, I think you are, you&#8217;re, what I take away from what you&#8217;re<br>describing is, An example of still kind of what we, our long-term goal, like whatever the handling<br>of images, but allowing people to handle images consistently.<br>And if it&#8217;s, if it&#8217;s unrecognizable, if it&#8217;s just a task, if it, if we just make uploading images easier<br>than great, like, and we&#8217;re, and everybody has that problem, but if down the road, like, yeah, we<br>hear from people that they all want watermarks or they all want. Uh, you know, an image filter<br>and we can figure out how to do that.<br>It&#8217;s, it still, to me, falls in the same, the same ballpark. Yep.<br>Cory Miller: Now we need a business case, like, you know, take some of this [00:27:00]<br>abstract, creative thought and go, okay, how can we, back to what you kind of grounding us in<br>as like consistent, I heard the word consistent, consistent. unique to the brand Yeah. That<br>they&#8217;re trying to portray.<br>That&#8217;s really interesting thought cuz I, I love templates. I mean, obviously mm-hmm. , that&#8217;s the<br>it that&#8217;s High Themes came from Template. Template Monster. You know, I was a, I had used<br>Template Monster 2004 or five for a website, um, that wasn&#8217;t in WordPress. I don&#8217;t even know<br>what it was in. Um, and I.<br>Offering somebody some flavors to have a head start to, to create something creative. Like for,<br>for, for me, I can&#8217;t draw, you know, I doodle, but some kind of headstart to help somebody do the<br>things. Yep. Consistent you need to your brand, um, you, your [00:28:00] own kinda style that<br>you could develop. Um, kinda like paint by numbers, so.<br>Okay. Thanks for letting me die. Tribe on. Wonder and fascination about all this. Um, you<br>wanted to talk about settings?<br>Corey Maass: Yeah. So I just shared, uh, something with you. Um, you see my screen? Yeah, I<br>can. So starting a settings page. Um, so we&#8217;ve got, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s working in this version yet,<br>so featured images, um, Oh yeah, I, I have a fix for this.<br>So you see the three, four is not actually three four. Um, so that I&#8217;ve, that&#8217;ll, that&#8217;ll be fixed in the<br>next version. A little thing that&#8217;s been bugging me. Um, but the, you know, we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve got the<br>actual cropper in a couple of places. Media ad new, no, it&#8217;s not in here. [00:29:00] Again, this is<br>just a non, a little local demo thing.<br>Um, but I started adding what we&#8217;d talked about previously. Uh, uh, the next thing we need, or<br>one of the next things we need is a settings page where we can define the, essentially the<br>defaults like we&#8217;re talking about. Um, So starting with one of the use cases or the, the place, the<br>implement, one of the implementations we&#8217;ve done, um, being featured images.<br>The idea being that right you, when you first install a plugin, we&#8217;ll walk you through these<br>essentially where, you know, okay, for featured images, what is, you know, you always want<br>your photo to be, or the resulting photo to be at least, you know, 500 wide, uh, you know, but not<br>more than 2000 wide. And then same with.<br>You know, something like this, right? So that you don&#8217;t, [00:30:00] you don&#8217;t end up with images<br>that are too small, but you don&#8217;t also don&#8217;t end up with images that are too large. Um, and then,<br>uh, presets,<br>Cory Miller: oh, you can remove. That&#8217;s cool.<br>Corey Maass: So, yeah, because it&#8217;s like, uh, the, the example of the featured image, right? It&#8217;s<br>like we have given you these six square circle, 16, 9 43.<br>but it&#8217;s like, you don&#8217;t, you don&#8217;t want to give you, you, you know, if, if your featured image<br>should always be a circle, then, then why do you have to select circle every time? Right. And so<br>in settings, yeah, you can go in and remove, um, you know, everything but the circle. Um, and<br>then save it. And then that&#8217;s the idea being that, you know, you hit save here and then the next<br>time you come into here where you&#8217;re setting your featured image circle would be the only thing<br>available.<br>Um, and obviously if there&#8217;s, if there&#8217;s only one, then it&#8217;ll be pre-selected and so then [00:31:00]<br>it saves you a step. Um, and then, and then there&#8217;s also the option of, um, so this isn&#8217;t quite</p>



<p>functioning, but, um, Choose a preset. So it&#8217;s, if you, if you know, I&#8217;ve now deleted all of the, the<br>default preset 16 nine, you can re-add it here, or there&#8217;s this, you know, I, this just, this is my<br>preset, but it&#8217;s like you can, you can name it the query, uh, Miller preset with an aspect ratio of,<br>you know, whatever, whatever.<br>Um, I think this works. Yeah. There&#8217;s the Corey Miller preset. Um, awesome. So, so this is, this<br>is what I started with, um, again, with the idea that what you set is what&#8217;s gonna get translated<br>to here. So the presets are choose your shape, you then have those to choose from. Um, and<br>then when you cropped an [00:32:00] image, the output would match whatever your Minn Max<br>is.<br>Um, I haven&#8217;t quite, I&#8217;m not sure what. Parallel is yet, is it, is it always you? It should be the<br>minimum, but should it go up to the max? You know, we&#8217;ll figure that out. But, um, is, is this kind<br>of what you had in mind? Does this resonate with you? Anything missing?<br>Cory Miller: Um, now that the preset thing is really awesome, like being able to set that here, I<br>think that&#8217;s very forward thinking.<br>Work. You know, I continue to think through work, through flow, come in here, configure it<br>yourself, save it, make it easier on the client, and it becomes a pretty easy thing to, for the<br>problem of getting right sized images per the theme design. So I think that&#8217;s cool. Would you<br>scroll up a little bit? So this puts it, [00:33:00] this men stuff puts it where, Any image that goes<br>through it and scrub by it will not be bigger.<br>So that then whatever we&#8217;ve listed here.<br>Corey Maass: Okay. Yeah, the, you know, it&#8217;s like if you thinking about pr, you know, protecting<br>people from themselves. So if they upload a 10 pixel by 10 pixel emoji and they, but they want to<br>use that as a high res, uh, featured image, then it. Upscale it and look terrible, but that&#8217;s better<br>than them, than a 10 by 10 pixel image getting stuck in there.<br>And then same with like, what we keep talking about is uploading from your photo where, or<br>uploading from your phone where a photo is six megs. No, bring it down, you know, and, and,<br>and 4,000 pixels. It&#8217;s like, no, bring it down to the web. Really doesn&#8217;t need more than 2000<br>pixels. [00:34:00]<br>Cory Miller: So, okay, so the experience is come in here, set it here, put some guardrails.<br>Um, bumpers. Bumpers. Keep talking about bowling, bowling. Bowling bumpers. Okay. Then<br>when they go to do it from like, this is the basic settings. Start, you know, start hearing, get a<br>little bumpers, but then the workflow, if they&#8217;re going into the image and all that kind of stuff. Is<br>there a plan for. Letting them customize that in the featured image and the other, you know,<br>tools in the post.<br>That&#8217;s a good question because here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking. Like web designer developer would<br>go, there&#8217;s your guardrails. Cool. You know? Yeah. And then they get into the live, and I think<br>maybe they, like we were doing the ratios to be simple. Click boom, there you go. But if<br>someone goes. You know, I don&#8217;t know.<br>I want [00:35:00] the cropped image, like I think we were talking about, there&#8217;s a featured image<br>section, then there&#8217;s another section which is in lieu of the block. Yeah. It&#8217;s like upload an image<br>and, and my question would be like, I think we should consider in that, that screen over there,<br>letting them do the custom dimensions there potentially.<br>Corey Maass: Mm. Yeah, so I, I think if I understand you, like we&#8217;ve got a, we&#8217;ve got a bypass,<br>which lets them upload. Straight from their hard drive. And then I also think, if I&#8217;m hearing you<br>correctly, we need a bypass, essentially, these settings. So it&#8217;s like you can still use the cropper,<br>but you can essentially make bad choices if you want to.<br>Uh, and I, and I think maybe that, like there&#8217;s a, I also envision a toggle in here that enables<br>that. And so there&#8217;d be like, here are the [00:36:00] guardrails, you know, a and maybe this<br>screen, so at least, at least for my use case, right? I am, I am an ad I, I have the WordPress<br>admin role. I have the WordPress role of administrator, and then all of my clients have a<br>contributor role, or I&#8217;ve made up another, um, another role called site admin.<br>And so they still think that they&#8217;re admins, but I&#8217;ve actually disabled a bunch of things so that<br>again, they can&#8217;t, they can&#8217;t go in and update a plugin that they shouldn&#8217;t or delete a plugin or<br>change themes. Have had clients go in and just be like, what does this do? And totally break a<br>site. . And so I think in, in, in here, there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;d be a, like an advanced toggle that says, lock<br>this shit down.</p>



<p>Yeah. Or these are the recommended. Let them make bad choices if they want to. And so like<br>for my clients, for [00:37:00] featured images, hard, hard, hard rule, it&#8217;s 16 nine. Full stop, no<br>exceptions. And so I would switch that toggle to be like, do not let them make any other choices.<br>But you know, the o our other implementation, so this screen would essentially be repeated for<br>media library.<br>I haven&#8217;t reported it over yet, but in media library I might allow more presets. I also might toggle<br>it the other way and say, you know, let them. Upload something because frankly, like we also<br>use the media library for, um, you know, hosting an image to send to the press. And so we then<br>we want a high res image and we&#8217;re just basically using our WordPress install as file storage.<br>And so they would, they would hit a little button that says, just let me upload, you know, leave<br>me alone and let me upload the, the image or let me crop it, but leave it at 7,000 pixels or, or<br>whatever. So, yeah. [00:38:00] That&#8217;s another necessary.<br>Cory Miller: I think this is the work, this is the workflow for an organization or the developer<br>here in this screen.<br>Yeah. What I&#8217;m thinking is I go, okay, because we, the crux of the problem we started with<br>months ago was it&#8217;s a pain in the butt to like crop an image to make it reasonable for the web<br>and look good. And I, if I&#8217;m just Corey Blogger, Corey website thing, I go, okay, I&#8217;m writing a<br>post. I go, okay, I need an image.<br>I want an image for it in here and want it. Obviously I you won&#8217;t believe how many times I&#8217;ve like<br>gotten. A screenshot tool or something to go How many pixels wide is my Yeah. Post column<br>with, you know, and I, we&#8217;ve talked a lot about this, but I go, maybe I [00:39:00] want it really tall<br>in the, in the place or something like that doesn&#8217;t fit a preset mm-hmm.<br>you know, like, here&#8217;s the quick presets we&#8217;ve done. Just go here and you can kind of keep it<br>standard that checks that consistent box, but, Utility of the crop to make it whatever it needs to<br>be for that page design. Yeah, that&#8217;s the workflow I&#8217;m thinking about because I think this is<br>where we need to be for the, I&#8217;m handing this project over to you and I&#8217;m trying to keep you right<br>in the bumpers and I think that big time checks the agency box and some point I wanna share<br>that with our agency owner channel and just get some feedback and.<br>Understand the problems they actually face, but the other side is to make this ubiquitous and<br>easy to use. How do we make it really practical and easy for what they&#8217;re trying to do? And I&#8217;m<br>just talking that out, going, I wonder, you know, they find the image, [00:40:00] they upload it,<br>but they want it, you know, you know how it goes.<br>Sometimes the image doesn&#8217;t fit right. A, a ratio.<br>Corey Maass: So, yeah. Well, and yeah, and I think, you know, we. What we don&#8217;t want to do is<br>limit people&#8217;s creativity and so, you know, and what&#8217;s WordPress? Uh, The mantra, but I think it,<br>I think it&#8217;s actually backwards. They say decisions, not options or something like that.<br>But anyway, in, in our case, we actually want at least, at least sensible options. Um, you know,<br>or, or we don&#8217;t, we can&#8217;t speak for everybody, at least not yet . Um, and, and so yeah, letting<br>people. Bypass the, all these things. Um, I think if nothing else, you know, I mean more of the<br>spirit of WordPress and, and more, you know, the freedom to, to do what you want.<br>I mean, they can always disable the plugin. I&#8217;ve even done that with, there&#8217;s a plugin by short<br>[00:41:00] pixel that. It&#8217;s called something like resize after Upload. And so it, I installed that early<br>on so that client&#8217;s uploading it just lets you, uh, ju similar to some of this, right? It lets you set a<br>sensible limit, so it&#8217;s like resize anything over 2,500 pixels, down to 2,500 pixels.<br>And that&#8217;s all it does, but it&#8217;s it per it, it has saved us so much disk space. They will make a<br>mistake and upload something that&#8217;s, you know, two megs and 7,000 pixels or whatever. So,<br>um, but I&#8217;ve had to. Like, there were times when we wanted, uh, like we had a blog post that<br>was a web comic, and so we needed it 7,000 tall.<br>So I went in disabled, the plugin, and this is the process I had to do right as I went in. Had to go<br>in, disable the plugin, upload the full, full version, and then go back in and reenable the plugin.<br>So yeah, if there was a like click here to bypass just this one time, [00:42:00] uh, you know, then<br>it would&#8217;ve saved me.<br>Six clicks and a, and a bunch of load time. Um, so yeah, to, to make sure that we ac we<br>accommodate that or offer the option to accommodate that , uh, options to offer options always<br>gets a little meta, but I do think that that&#8217;s crucial as much because like we keep talking about,<br>we don&#8217;t, we just don&#8217;t know yet.</p>



<p>We don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s really gonna use this. We don&#8217;t really know. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s why like, I<br>like the thinking. We did at the beginning of this phone call about using, talking about filters. But<br>to me, filters is an example or of, of that, which we don&#8217;t know yet, but are the kind of features<br>that we can offer.<br>Not fi filters specifically, but some sort of photo manipulation, assuming that that&#8217;s what people<br>want. But I also, I think I&#8217;ve, I mean, I&#8217;m having fun looking at discovering. How robust<br>JavaScript is [00:43:00] now and, and what it can do, including photo manipulation. But to me,<br>cropping a circle was a no-brainer for this, you know, for v1.<br>But adding photo filters is, is down the road at some point because it&#8217;s, it could be a lot of noise<br>within the product and if nobody wants it, then we don&#8217;t wanna add that much noise.<br>Cory Miller: I feel like too, a lot of this just kind of pulling up for the overall product journey we&#8217;re<br>on. Mm-hmm. is trying to find that spark.<br>Yeah. Like we&#8217;re talking through things that we think are good ideas, thought like really<br>thoughtfully trying to embody the experience and I feel like we&#8217;re trying to find a little spark of<br>something when we, when we talk about feedback and like, Someone goes, yeah, that what you<br>just said there, but like a lot of the process of product like this is trying to get just lucky and, and<br>find that little spark of, [00:44:00] hey, here it, here it goes.<br>You know? So it&#8217;s good for me to kind of reset and go, yeah, doesn&#8217;t feel good to see fewer than<br>10, you know? But like we&#8217;re trying to get it out there enough and we&#8217;re doing this obviously, so<br>we find a spark somewhere in there and they go, Hey, that&#8217;s what I. To, I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s, let me<br>throw in another sport.<br>Fishing,<br>We&#8217;re trying to fish and go like, yeah, we think this is good. So I&#8217;m trying not to make too many,<br>um, minute feedback things about the thing. I go. We, we, we decided a couple weeks ago, we<br>kept talking about like the custom dimensions. So you&#8217;ve done the settings page and now this<br>seems to be the other side.<br>And just kind of getting it out there and going, like, does this, does this work? Part of it, I think<br>for me is I&#8217;m not actively blogging as much at all, and I haven&#8217;t for a long time, but I need to get<br>back in the [00:45:00] process and start documenting, you know, when I&#8217;m Yeah. Trying to<br>express a. Feeling, emotion, whatever those things are.<br>Um, and then going through the press of like, what, you know, for me, I&#8217;m trying to commit to<br>this, this going, okay, let me find an image for this. That kind of hits at what I&#8217;m trying to get at,<br>you know? Yep. Um, back to Instagram, that&#8217;s what I loved about Instagram and those little<br>apps, you remember those apps that take like a second a day and it&#8217;d kind of be a journal and.<br>It started with an image and then it became, you know, people tried to blow up the content<br>underneath. Um, I needed to play around that with, in my head a little bit and practice it of like,<br>what if I started with an image and wrote and just put, get back doing my click and publish<br>again, and then note all my pain points with finding [00:46:00] images that are appropriate.<br>Corey Maass: And I&#8217;m going to, um, to me we&#8217;re, I like your fishing analogy. We&#8217;re fishing with<br>a, with a all lure. We&#8217;re still building. You know, we, we&#8217;ve got the hook and we&#8217;ve got the eyes,<br>but we need the little wiggly bit that the fish will actually be attracted to or whatever. Um, but I&#8217;m<br>not, I guess I&#8217;m, to me, I&#8217;m not yet casting with the intent of actually catching fish like I&#8217;m casting<br>to just kind of make sure that it, it all still holds together when it hits the water.<br>Um, I think with a, with some basic settings, uh, with a block at that point. Like I wanna start<br>promoting it a lot more, putting it on, you know, actually put it in some places. Um, I think at that,<br>that&#8217;s when, you know, we actually are version complete and we can start sending it to some<br>blogs. Um, You know, you, you do a, a Google search for word [00:47:00] plug, you know,<br>WordPress plugin, photo cropping or photo manipulation, and then go find all those listicles and<br>add some comments and, and basically just do kind of the, the, the bare minimum, uh, s e o and<br>spreading of the word.<br>I think the other thing is, um, I don&#8217;t remember who it was, um, Kathy. Or somebody. Yeah,<br>Kathy, um, typed in crop, uh, in the plug-in directory and. Um, and it was like, I think just crop,<br>we&#8217;re not even on the first page. If you do crop.express, we come right up, but crop space<br>express doesn&#8217;t come up. So we, you know, we need to start tweaking some of, you know,<br>looking at, cuz at that point, like the, the README that&#8217;s in there now is, is almost, is already<br>almost not.</p>



<p>Accurate in that we&#8217;ve added more features. And so revisiting that, revisiting the wording,<br>starting to play with the [00:48:00] wording, but it&#8217;s like at that point we are at least a fully<br>functional product. And so then, then I feel much better about talking about it. I also look forward<br>to like, I will make my clients use this whether they like it or not, and I will toggle it so that they<br>are locked down.<br>Um, and then I will hear their complaints, you know, good, or, or I guess you don&#8217;t have good<br>complaints, but I will hear their feedback, good or bad. Um, but it&#8217;s, um, you know, to me a very<br>real world use case. So, um, we&#8217;re. I guess I&#8217;m trying to get us there, right? Like basic settings,<br>basic implementation. Um, and then I, I, and then frankly, like at that point, at we, we, we.<br>It&#8217;s fun to keep talking every week, but I almost feel like at least what I&#8217;ve done in the past is at<br>that point we, like, we let a couple of months go by and maybe we&#8217;re working on, we&#8217;re still<br>working on it [00:49:00] or we&#8217;re working on a companion or we&#8217;re, you know, something else is<br>cooking. But, um, The, you know, one of the best things that happened to me was, you know,<br>my social link pages plug in.<br>I built it and then, uh, had to stop working on it cuz of a job I was doing. And the year went by<br>and I stopped doing that job and I came back and was like, oh, it has a thousand active installs.<br>And it was like letting it grow organically. Mm. You know, letting time happen naturally. Like I<br>probably could have made that ramp happen a little bit faster, but not a lot, you know, at least at<br>the level I&#8217;m at.<br>Like we, like we talked about, if you&#8217;re starting from zero, you&#8217;ve only got so many favors you<br>can call in. You&#8217;ve only got so many eyes on you. You&#8217;ve only got, um, you know, I think we&#8217;ve,<br>we&#8217;ve both got a little bit of an, I, you&#8217;ve got a much bigger audience than I do. We both are<br>involved with communities, but you know, we are not, [00:50:00] Uh, who&#8217;s a successful<br>blogger?<br>Tim Ferris or, you know, Paul Jarvis or, um, Joel s Spolsky, or, you know, whoever, like big, big<br>names that have attention on them. And so we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve, there will be, there will come a day<br>when we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve basically tapped every lead that we can think of, and then it&#8217;s like, okay, so<br>let&#8217;s let a week go by and let some, you know, let the internet do its job and, and spreading the<br>word.<br>Cory Miller: That&#8217;s good grounding.<br>Corey Maass: It&#8217;s hard. It&#8217;s hard,<br>Cory Miller: like even if I want to, I, I&#8217;m always so impatient and want to accelerate and get to<br>the things, but I, that&#8217;s really good grounding.<br>Corey Maass: It&#8217;s like, well, if we, if we had a gajillion dollars, if, if we had investment, I&#8217;m not,<br>obviously, I&#8217;m not advocating that, but it&#8217;s like, If we were in that kind of situation or we were able<br>to, you know, sit down in an office day after day and say like, this is our job.<br>[00:51:00] Very different trajectory. Yeah, but I don&#8217;t, but we&#8217;re not in that position.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah, it&#8217;s true.<br>Okay. Well anyway, so go ahead.<br>Corey Maass: Oh, I was just gonna say like, we&#8217;ve got five minutes and I actually need to wrap<br>up on time today, so, okay. Um, just wanted to check in with you, see, see if there&#8217;s anything<br>else to talk about or what else you wanted to talk about. Put you on the spot here. I<br>Cory Miller: think that&#8217;s it. I want to keep kind of pushing in and trying to find, um, I think my<br>part in this is sniffing the problem that we go there.<br>It, you know, there it is. That could potentially illuminate it to bring in money for sales, whatever it<br>might be. But, um, and going like, I think we got a pretty cool thing here. It seems to me for the<br>future, it&#8217;s like [00:52:00] image creation in that cate, something in this category is the potential<br>for the pro. And I&#8217;m keen to just go, like, personally finding the angles in there that would go right<br>here.<br>This could be a little, this could be a V1 into the paid, you know, finding that, that little mix. But<br>thanks for keeping us on track with this. I, I think where we&#8217;re going with this setting is great. It&#8217;s<br>all there. It&#8217;s functional or it will be, and, uh, try to get a little bit more stepped in the, into the.<br>Finding our people<br>Corey Maass: Yeah. For this. Yeah. And I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, you know, I don&#8217;t think I need to say it, but I&#8217;ll<br>say it anyway. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. Like, I&#8217;m also anxious and excited. Unfortunately, this week,<br>once again, life happens. And so I&#8217;ve, on Monday, a tight deadline Okay. With a day job. Um, but<br>I&#8217;m, but I&#8217;m, there&#8217;s something is going to shift [00:53:00] and I, I almost want to, uh, I wanna</p>



<p>make sure we don&#8217;t keep having the same conversation week over week, , uh, both for the<br>people listening in, but of course for ourselves.<br>Cuz that that&#8217;s also when we&#8217;re like, okay, yeah, last week we said we were gonna do this, it&#8217;s<br>still not done. So I guess another week goes by, you know, and then, and then we get frustrated.<br>So, um, trying to chip away at it and. But I think, cuz I think something will shift once we<br>honestly look at our, what, at our initial offering crop express the plugin and say, okay, that&#8217;s in<br>the repo as as a complete fishing lure, , or whatever.<br>Um, you know, and, and, and people are using it. And we are using it cuz it actually like does<br>solve the problems that we&#8217;re talking about.<br>Cory Miller: Yeah. Yeah. I wrote down here too, when you said block earlier, uh, I&#8217;ll follow back</p>



<p>up with Robbie [00:54:00] Umhmm. That&#8217;s right. We had the whole thing come back. Yeah. Mm-<br>hmm. . But it seems like I knew Block had some complexity, uh, you know, that we talked about,</p>



<p>but I know you&#8217;re heavily embedded into the Beaver Builder community and used it prolifically.<br>And we got that contact with Robbie, so I&#8217;ll follow back up with him. Kathy was the other one.<br>And then I still need to ping the Elementor team. Um, cuz that could be a, you know, it feels like<br>we need that. Somebody going Yeah. But mm-hmm. this or, you know, reactions like, what, what<br>we need. So, um, let me do that with the Robbie, Kathy, aunt Cadence and then, um, ping, ping<br>the team over at on Mentor.<br>Corey Maass: Yeah, and honestly like think about, so I, I think one of the things that you could<br>be doing. Is, or, or what you are doing, but [00:55:00] do more of, is this kind of, essentially, it&#8217;s<br>not really a custom inter customer interview, but kind of, sort of, yeah, yeah. Um, so like, you<br>know, put it on your Twitter or look for a way to, to elevate that question in post status or, and I,<br>I&#8217;m not sure what the question is, but I, I kind of want to put that, put that on your plate.<br>Let me keep focusing on the development of, of the first version of the plugin. Um, but if you can<br>be having starting, or, I mean, and, and usually, you know, tweet into the void and maybe<br>nobody comes back, but it&#8217;s the, like, you know, how, how do you, how do you find images or<br>like, that&#8217;s not the problem we&#8217;re solving yet, so I don&#8217;t wanna really ask that question yet.<br>But, you know, how, what problem, how painful do you, yeah. You know, is it, do you, do you,<br>you know, either define the problem, you know, do you have, do you wish that there was a<br>better crop in WordPress? Or what apps [00:56:00] do you use to manipulate a photo before<br>you upload it to your blog post? Or, um, you know, I think there&#8217;s, I think there&#8217;s, you asked a<br>couple of questions to help figure out the right question to ask and then start asking that in more<br>places.<br>Um, okay. Cuz that, that&#8217;ll. I think it&#8217;s, you know, you pinging the specific people is huge. Um,<br>especially tapping into if, if they are a, a essentially a gateway into, uh, a community or a, a<br>team that is facing a problem over and over again. But I would, I&#8217;d love to hear some, like,<br>answers in the wild too of like throw it on Twitter and see if, if people.<br>Have a response, you know? Um, yeah, because like you said, there&#8217;s, I, I do feel like we are<br>looking for a spark. Like I have this other, um, app, you know, a p i service that I built a while<br>ago that I want to talk to you some other time [00:57:00] about offline. Um, But it&#8217;s like I, and, uh,<br>well, I&#8217;ve mentioned a couple times.<br>I, I built it 99% of the way and then stopped and have not opened it up because I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m just<br>missing that spark. Like the, and, and then just today somebody, it, it pertains to screenshots.<br>And so somebody today was like, oh, is there a WordPress plugin that takes this kind of<br>screenshot? And I was like, oh my God, I never even thought of that.<br>And I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t, still don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the spark, but I&#8217;m, you know, I&#8217;m pulling at that thread. I<br>messaged the guy and then we&#8217;re. We&#8217;re chatting via email, like I might bang together a quick<br>use case for &#8217;em to like see if that&#8217;s part of the spark. You know what I mean? So<br>Cory Miller: I, I would love to talk about that.<br>Cause you&#8217;ve mentioned it in our other discussions. I&#8217;d love to talk about that more because, I<br>mean, I think there&#8217;s one thing that I&#8217;m really interested in. It&#8217;s like images and they mentioned<br>Yeah, exactly. No, being able to do that and like, I love the, I think it was a screen. Tool<br>potentially you were talking about?<br>Um, yeah. [00:58:00] Or in that realm. And Yeah. And it makes me put, like, higher on my list is<br>the OMG IMG site as our base for Yeah. Being able to explore this. Here&#8217;s your free plug into<br>crop, you know, like that sticker mill thing. Like here&#8217;s your total mm-hmm. ,<br>Corey Maass: which by, by the way, Sticker Mule, they have, um, specials once in a while.</p>



<p>So I ordered us, um, 10 crop express stickers for a dollar. So we have our first swag, so as it, it<br>has shipped. So I need your, I need your address. Yep. And, uh, uh, I&#8217;ll send you five. And then<br>we each have five crop express plugin or, um, plugin stickers for, for the fun of it. .<br>Cory Miller: I, I want an OMG IMG Hoodie<br>Corey Maass: oh yes. . Yes.<br>And that, that logo, we&#8217;re gonna need to spend a little more time on roughly. So, yeah,<br>[00:59:00] I want, I want rainbows and unicorns or something. I don&#8217;t know yet. Ice cream<br>cones, but hey brother, I could keep<br>Cory Miller: talking, but I know you need to jet.<br>Corey Maass: Yeah, I gotta bounce.<br>Cory Miller: All right. Uh, I&#8217;m pumped. Thanks, man.<br>Corey Maass: Yeah, we&#8217;ll talk soon.</p>
