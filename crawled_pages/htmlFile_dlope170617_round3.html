										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy, howdy! </p>



<p>Next week, we will head back to to Munich to take over our new apartment and start to explore the new neighborhood on foot.  While getting situated, still provisionally, we will patiently wait until our furniture to arrive from Miami. The weather is starting to get warmer, too. Everything is new. Good times. </p>



<p>I also will start migrating the Gutenberg Times website to a block theme, and hopefully can take you along with my lessons learned and some tips to avoid the pitfalls. Maybe. If you already made the switch with one of your sites, email me to <a href="mailto:pauli@gutenbergtimes.com">pauli@gutenbergtimes.com</a>.  I really would like to learn more. </p>



<p>Before, I can start this next project, I will work on the next Gutenberg plugin release. Stay tuned. </p>



<p>Yours, 💕<br><em>Birgit</em></p>

<p>During this month&#8217;s <em>Developer Hours</em>,  <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/adamzielin">Adam Zieliński</a></strong> will  introduce the new <strong>WordPress Playground</strong> tool. </p>



<p>It runs WordPress in the browser without the need for PHP, Apache, or MySQL.</p>



<p>In this presentation, <strong>Zieliński</strong>, a member of the development team that created WordPress Playground, will introduce this exciting new implementation and demonstrate it. He will also explain the technologies that make the magic happen, and run through a variety of scenarios and use cases. There will be ample time for Q &amp; A.

<p><strong>Tammy Lister,</strong> early design lead of Gutenberg, and published the 10 steps on how to <strong><a href="http://nownextlab.com/2023/04/28/embracing-gutenberg-as-a-product/">embrace Gutenberg as a product</a>. </strong>Step One she writes:<em> &#8220;One of the biggest questions would be ‘What is Gutenberg’. I tend to push back around that and say it’s WordPress. The system, the mindset, and the approach have been around for so long now and have been a part of the core development – after all, we are through phase two and starting phase three, Collaboration. So, this is step one to embracing Gutenberg as a product; see it as nothing different from WordPress.&#8221;</em> Curious? There are nine more to go! </p>

McAlister wrote: &#8220;One of the most powerful features of the Ollie block theme is that it brings together all the new WordPress site building features in a cohesive experience. Site editor,&nbsp;global styles, patterns, templates, template parts&nbsp;— Ollie supports all of these features, and they’re all beautifully designed and super easy to edit and customize.&#8221; </p>

<p><strong>Nathan Wrigley</strong> had <strong>Ryan Welcher</strong> on his WPTavern Jukebox podcast: <a href="https://wptavern.com/podcast/73-ryan-welcher-on-using-the-create-block-tool-to-quickly-scaffold-a-new-block-plugin"><strong>Ryan Welcher on Using the create-block Tool to Quickly Scaffold a New Block Plugin</strong></a> . They discussed what you can expect from the create-block tool, and the prior knowledge that you’ll need to have once the tool has you up and running. </p>



<p>I have been using the create block command line tool to spin up a new block projects. It also helps you package your new block into a plugin and test it for the single block plugin repository.  You can also have multiple blocks in one block. You just want to study about the commands, and how they can make your life easier. The documentation pages are available in the block editor handbook: <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block/"><strong>@wordpress/create-block</strong></a>. Once yours start using it, you probably would also be interested in creating a custom templates to add to the scaffolding tool.

<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Hello, and welcome to our 82nd episode of the Gutenberg Changelog Podcast. In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about the Gutenberg plugin version 15.6, the proposed schedule for WordPress 6.3, and a few things that are in the works again. I&#8217;m your host Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source Project. I&#8217;m thrilled to have with me today, co-host Nick Diego, plugin developer, core contributor as well, and we are both part of Automattic’s Five for the Future project. Nick and I teamed up to manage the Gutenberg plugin release 15.6, so this is fresh from the press, so to speak. Thanks for joining me today again at the Gutenberg Changelog. Nick, how are you today?</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I&#8217;m doing great. I&#8217;m very excited that 15.6 is out in the wild now.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, me too. And this is a daily dose of Nick Diego for me because the last two days we were in communication about the release.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>



<p>But before we head into the Gutenberg 15.6 release, let&#8217;s do a few announcements from the WordPress project. As mentioned in the intro, the release schedule for WordPress 6.3 proposal is published and includes a call for volunteers for the release squad. A beta is proposed to be, beta one, is proposed to be on June 27th, 2023. So it&#8217;s after WordCamp and “after after” WordCamp, so to speak, WordCamp Europe. Release candidate and dev notes. Deadline is proposed for July 18th, 2023, and then the final release is proposed to be scheduled on August 8th, 2023. So you raised your hand right, Nick? I raised my hand.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I did. Yeah. Yes, exactly. So yeah, I&#8217;ve been in the editor triage lead for the last three-year releases and it was a new role when I started. I&#8217;d love to help somebody grow into that role because I love doing it, but we want to see other people in that role as well. And I think it&#8217;s a fun role. It&#8217;s pretty unique. Yeah, it&#8217;s not very technical. It&#8217;s more organizational and just engaging with other release leads and kind of keeping everything moving smoothly. So it&#8217;s a great lead for somebody who maybe is not as technical but wants to really engage with the release.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah, I want to change my role. The last three releases, I did documentation pieces and especially the Gutenberg dev notes wrangle them through GitHub and that is definitely something that somebody that is not technical can do as well. I&#8217;m open to mentor somebody for 6.3 and the proposal for the schedule comes actually on the heels of Josepha Haden Chomphosy’s post, which preparing for the next women and non-binary release squad, AKA underrepresented gender squad.</p>



<p>And if you want to be part of it, you can raise your hands in the comments there. And of course we have the links and show notes, but if you haven&#8217;t worked on the major WordPress release squad before, it would be really good and you want to be part of the underrepresented gender squad, it would be good that you also look at the schedule for 6.3 and raise your hand there because quite a few mentors would be available to skill up contributors to be part of 6.4 because that&#8217;s how you get new people in that you need to&#8230; We need to shepherd them through the responsibilities and how things work and who to talk to and how this all&#8230; It can be very intimidating when you haven&#8217;t done this before.</p>



<p>So not to throw you into the deep end of the water to swim.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: It&#8217;s always good to see how the sausage is made and there&#8217;s so much going on and so many people involved. I know when I first did it, I was very intimidated, but after you see it once, it starts to make a bit more sense. So yeah, mentor for 6.3 and then get really well-prepared for 6.4.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. And if you want to learn more, yeah, you find us on Twitter or on the WordPress Slack and you can just kind of DM us or ask us some questions there. Well, I volunteered you now. Big sorry.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. Oh, if anybody has any questions about the release, feel free to reach out to us. We&#8217;re here to help, here to get more people on board with the release. I know for myself, it kind of kicked off my journey in contributing more to WordPress and it really made me kind of fall in love with the process. And so I highly encourage anybody else who might be even a little bit interested to start exploring it.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And if you want to help the quality race on some of the products, you can also follow the FSE outreach program that has been in place for two and a half years almost. And there is, Anne McCarthy runs the program and you still have until April 26th to follow the testing call number 20. And that is using the create block theme plugin to create a block theme and you get some instructions on the call for testing. It&#8217;s another six days, but if you are not so much into theme development, maybe you want to do the new call for testing that just came out and have some front page fun with a block scene and create some templates that are for the front page. And there is actually also a developer news blog out, blog post out that just came out last week, and that is by Justin Tadlock using the template patterns to build multiple homepage designs. So I don&#8217;t know exactly if they&#8217;re related, but I&#8217;m pointing you to it as well, so you get a little bit broader picture of it. Yes.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: And I want to stress that these call for testings, even if you&#8217;ve been building with blocks forever and you&#8217;re very engaged, it&#8217;s a great exercise to go through. I consider myself very entrenched in WordPress and know what&#8217;s going on, but sometimes when you go through these testing calls, you find pitfalls or issues that somebody who&#8217;s maybe brand new to blocks would encounter. It&#8217;s a great way to find problems or things that can be fixed to make that onboarding experience smoother. So I know I always find things that I don&#8217;t expect, but the goal of these call for testing is to make WordPress better. And so even if you use WordPress every day, I encourage you.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a good point. Absolutely. And if I want to get something done on my theme, for instance, for the Gutenberg Times or for my personal blog and try to do this, I always find something that might be a little quirky, that might be a little bit, oh, I haven&#8217;t thought about that, but now that I use it, maybe there are some things that could be easier to handle or more intuitive or I run into some problems.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s so fresh from out of the releases that there&#8217;s always&#8230; There is no bug free software. That ship has sailed when we so many people are involved. All right.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Absolutely.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. But that&#8217;s also something if I get asked, I want to contribute to WordPress, but I don&#8217;t know how. So I&#8217;ll appoint them to the testing calls because it&#8217;s gets them hands-on with the WordPress site and also contribute back by just giving feedback. You don&#8217;t have to know the processes. You don&#8217;t need to know any development, but when something doesn&#8217;t work right and you can raise your hand and say, I found something and explain that to other people. And Anne has been very good in creating GitHub issues for the developers and to feed that back into the development process.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Absolutely.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: For the community contribution, I wanted to point out Ryan Welcher started a new series on his Twitch stream and it&#8217;s called Bring Me Your Issues. And he uploaded the first of the few issues for persistence on YouTube, and I wanted to point you to it. He also went through the work and added chapter timestamps to it, and especially for the first one that was really helpful because that&#8217;s a two and a half hour Twitch session. I really admire his persistence and his patience.</p>



<p>So you can look through the list of the topics that he covered and one of them&#8230; So I can only say three things, but that it was more so how to use the create block scaffolding tool. It&#8217;s always interesting to see that and how to build an edit block for the lockdown user. So edit post block I should say. And that&#8217;s certainly something that could come to core, but if it&#8217;s easier&#8230; Yeah, relatively easy to build, you can build it yourself. Then he answers the question, what and why inner blocks, which is a component that is for block building. And then another question is how to create a placeholder and parent and child relationships for your block development and using the example of a post pickup block. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: It&#8217;s a goldmine of tools and how to do different things, so if you haven&#8217;t checked out Ryan&#8217;s streams, you definitely should.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and there&#8217;s a second edition of it, where you can learn more about the get post type selectors in the data store and the use entity records, all technical terms, that you will know so easy after you listen to that. The render appender, I like that. The render appender on the inner box. And then in the third edition here, Ryan also talks a little bit over the Gutenberg 15.5 release and how to create a external template for APIs for the great block scaffolding tool. Always a good thing to know so you can create your own templates for the tool. There was actually also a topic at one of our Gutenberg live Q&amp;As was Grzegorz Ziolkowski and Fabian Kagy. It&#8217;s a couple of years old, but it&#8217;s still very, very current with demos and additional background on how to create those templates. So we share all this in the show notes. I know it&#8217;s a little bit tech and developer happy, heavy, happy too, but I just wanted to point out these new resources and additional resources.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, absolutely.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So GiveWP published a block-based visual donation form builder. That&#8217;s a mouthful, and it&#8217;s in beta. So GiveWP has, in an earlier episode, we discussed GiveWP&#8217;s way to rebuild the powerful donation plugin with our block first mindset and starting off with a WordPress native components and scripts to build the interface and only use custom code to augment it. And the visual donation form builder, it&#8217;s getting better, is the first product that comes from this effort. And if you work for an agency that helps nonprofits fundraise using the GiveWP Plugin, this beta is definitely for you. It&#8217;s also for you when you are working at a nonprofit organization and you are responsible for the fundraising and creating the campaign-related forms. This is also a beta for you. So it gives you early insight in what&#8217;s coming to GiveWP in the version 3.0. And it also gives you a better feel for what will be possible with a new form builder that isn&#8217;t available right now. So check it out, GiveWP. We have the link definitely in the show notes to the beta announcement, and that&#8217;s it from our community contributions.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Lots of good stuff.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s Released &#8211; Gutenberg 15.6</strong></h3>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So what&#8217;s released this week? We have Gutenberg 15.6 and we are coming right from it. It was released yesterday and the release post is also available now. It includes a total of 112 PRs. It&#8217;s a smaller release in comparison to the ones that come closer to a major WordPress release. It was authored by 45 contributors and seven of which were new contributors. So congratulations everyone on the good work and let&#8217;s get into what&#8217;s in there. And we&#8217;re starting out with, we now have spacing presets to the spacer block.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, this is what I&#8217;m so excited about. We&#8217;ve had&#8230; Since 6.1, presets were added to WordPress, which allow you to do a little slider for margin and padding and block app. It&#8217;s configuring margin or padding can be kind of complicated, but when you have a preset of small, medium, large or 1-2-3-4-5, it just makes it a little bit easier for the user. And the way that you could apply those, is you could actually make them fluid, using clamp to make them fluid, which allows for really interesting designs that don&#8217;t require media queries because you can make all your one margin for desktop, another for mobile. We didn&#8217;t have that for the spacer block, which adds vertical height between different blocks. So if you had a hundred pixel spacer block, you wanted it to be smaller on mobile, you would need to use custom CSS.</p>



<p>Well, now spacing presets come to the spacer block, which also in turn allows for fluid spacer blocks, which people have been asking for forever. Because the spacer block is such a natural tool. It&#8217;s so easy to add for end users. It makes sense. I want to add some space between these two items. Okay, add the spacer block, but now that they&#8217;re fluid&#8230; Now that you can make them fluid, it allows for dynamic websites where you have one size on desktop, another for tablet and another for mobile. And it&#8217;s all on this fluid spectrum and you don&#8217;t need media queries. You don&#8217;t need anything else. You&#8217;re just using these spacing presets. So I couldn&#8217;t be more excited. I&#8217;ve only have just began exploring this and I know other theme developers are as well, so exciting stuff.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Yeah, thank you so much for telling us about it. I also want to point out a blog post that&#8217;s on the developer blog and it kind of talks about that fluid part of intrinsic design versus media queries for theming and thinking about how designing WordPress makes it a little bit more modern when you&#8230; Because the proliferation of screen sizes, you are probably not very content with just three media or three sets. You might need 12 sets or 6 sets, and who keeps track of all the different settings for all these presets? Intrinsic design, that&#8217;s a fluid typography. That&#8217;s a fluid spacing. It&#8217;s definitely a way to go.</p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t say that you cannot have any media queries, but it&#8217;s definitely for the strategic way to build websites. It&#8217;s the way to go now.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Definitely.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And then we had, the cover block had border support, but now you also have these pop over resizable box and I think it also was in 15.5, but cover block has now a great border support. You can have the radios. You can have the colors. You can have the resizable block kind of&#8230; Resizable blocks adhered to those. Yeah, that was really nice when I tested it. I&#8217;m not quite sure that&#8217;s 5.6 native, but it&#8217;s definitely improved with 15.6</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: In 16.1, we did a huge effort to add all these design tools to most blocks, but border was left off a handful of them. One of them being cover block because of the clipping so if you did a background image and you tried to put border radius on it, you&#8217;d need to use overflow. It just became tricky with CSS and it took some more time to figure out how to implement that correctly. And so we finally got there and I think that this has been one of those things, why isn&#8217;t there border control? I thought, well, it was a little more tricky than we expected. So it&#8217;s nice to see it here and it really opens up a lot of designs and again, removes some extra custom CSS that you may have needed in the past to achieve a specific design.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So next thing on the list of change of was, add styles section to the&#8230; Well, they call it browse mode sidebar, but it&#8217;s the style editor of the style. Well, somebody called it site editor dark side as well, so which I don&#8217;t feel slightly better. It&#8217;s the left sidebar that is on the site editor. And now there is a style section where you can see all the styles that come with the theme, the style variations, and when you click on it, you see how your site changes, but there&#8217;s also an edit button there. So you can then go and open up the right side and change some of the settings for the style variation. And that is a very fluid workflow. I really love that. And it&#8217;s now in the Gutenberg plugin, so it&#8217;s really cool.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Before you had to know where the style variations were. You had to click into the template, then go to the style panel. And so this just makes it much more surfaced for users, allowing you to easily switch your style variation out. Great improvement, and also that name to be determined left-hand sidebar. That will get more features as we go on as well. But this is one additional addition beyond templates and template parts and navigation.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Those are the four main items right now. Yeah, navigation, global styles, template and template parts. And there might be a pattern in the future.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Hopefully.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Hopefully. Yes, yes, yes. And then in Gutenberg 15.6, there&#8217;s also two experiments. One is a new block that the details and summary block, which mostly was working by Carolina Nymark and she did a fantastic job, shepherding that for maybe a year until it actually got merged as an experiment into the plugin. It&#8217;s how you can hide things. You write a movie review and you want to hide the spoiler part where you reveal some of the drama in the movie, but you want your users to know or readers to know that you making a choice here. You open it up and it&#8217;s a spoiler. You can also hide some details on certain things. There are numerous of use cases and it&#8217;s quite nice because it has all the design tools. It has the typography. It has the spacing. It has the backgrounds, the colors. So it&#8217;s actually a nice little block and it can use some testing, but you need to go to the menu of the Gutenberg plugin into the experiments and check it on. Yeah. Have you used it Nick?</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, I played around with it quite a bit. I think that the colloquial term would be an accordion, is basically kind of what we&#8217;re talking about here. It&#8217;s really hard to do in an accessible way, which is one of the reasons why this has taken so long to get into WordPress. Core, that is. And so I think Carolina did a great job. The current experimental implementation includes a number of a parent block and then a number of child blocks. There&#8217;s another exploration that&#8217;s maybe trying to simplify that. But either way, we&#8217;re getting closer and closer to having this block and core and it&#8217;s something that everybody&#8217;s asked for. So why isn&#8217;t this in core? We want this in core. So it&#8217;s, it will get there and I think this is a great first step. Encourage everybody to try out the experiment. Find problems with it. Find out how we can make it better.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Excellent. And then there&#8217;s another experiment. It&#8217;s called a command center for the site editor. And that is really a rough interface right now if you switch it on. Yeah, don&#8217;t expect too much user-friendliness in there because it&#8217;s still in an experimental way. So if I understood this correctly, you get a little search bar like the spotlight on a Mac or so, and then you can say edit something or change color or so and it will get you to the place where you can actually do that. So you wouldn&#8217;t need to know all the 15 levels of menus to get to a certain place. I have not played with it. Did you test it a bit?</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yes, so we&#8217;ve been all hearing about artificial intelligence these days. AI is everywhere, and this is not AI, but it&#8217;s an experiment to start exploring one, how you can move things around. How you can move around the site. You could tell it, I want to add a new page, but you can also start to see where in the future you could hook in&#8230; third-party extenders could hook in a different additional functionality into this command center to do, write me a post about Mars, whatever. You can start to think about where this could eventually go, which is why this is currently an experiment, but the baseline is going to be take me to the styles panel, add a new page, simple things. But it could be huge. It could be a really important component of what WordPress is. And so really test it out, start exploring it. The idea behind it is it&#8217;s going to be very extensible, so you can add additional functionality as a third-party extender. So really excited to see where this goes.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, me too. And then there are quite a few, I call them or we call them here, quality of life kind of enhancements you don&#8217;t know that you need it until you see that what you get. And one of them is the smoother animations for the drop zone and what is a drop zone? It&#8217;s not a movie thing. You go from drag and drop and to drop, you need to know where you it’s is actually going on your canvas and the animation that&#8230; So there&#8217;s a blue line appearing on your canvas and it tells you, okay, your drop thingy will drop here when you release the button if you wanted to. And the animations are much smoother. It&#8217;s actually a delightful experience now to drag and drop blocks from one section to the other or from the list view over&#8230; From the list view over to your canvas. So that&#8217;s a very nice addition there.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really nice. And then there&#8217;s some improvements to list view itself around dragging. I&#8217;ve run into it too. You see sometimes you drag items within the list view and it’s&#8230; Things don&#8217;t go exactly where you want them to. And one of those was dragging underneath a container like a group block was a little challenging. And then they&#8217;ve improved that as well. So dragging and dropping and got it much easier across the board.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and that I think were all the highlights that we wanted to point out today from the Gutenberg 15.6 release. We will have the release post in the show notes so you can follow up on things.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>



<p>And now we want to talk to you about what&#8217;s in active development and what&#8217;s coming down the line. And first off is the work with patterns. So I hear this over and over again. I want to create my own patterns. Why can&#8217;t I do this with WordPress? I need a plugin. And we know all the good plugins. There&#8217;s a, Justin Tadlock had a plugin to create patterns and Block Meister was one, and then WP Engine came out with a pattern builder. And so Ari has a work in progress to add UI to allow saving patterns. And we definitely share that and it&#8217;s coming along fine, but it&#8217;s still a work in progress. And I don&#8217;t know what are the problems they&#8217;re hitting? Do you have a feeling on how that&#8217;s difficult?</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Well, I think it&#8217;s one of those things where we have all sorts of different entities in the block editor. We have reusable blocks. We have templates. We have template parts. What do you use when? What do you use where? And so I think that not only the functionality of being able to save a pattern, but also the UI around saving a pattern and making it clear to users when you should use one over the other and in what context things should be used. So there&#8217;s a technical issue and then there&#8217;s also a UI understanding user experience issue as well. So it&#8217;s getting there. It&#8217;s great to see this happening in core patterns are such a great way to create content and then use it in different places. And being able to do that in core would be such a huge benefit. It would allow you to design something, save it as a pattern, go to a different page, use your pattern. There&#8217;s just so many delightful applications of this and really excited to see it moving forward.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it definitely needs to be in there. And there&#8217;s also a work done on the WP pattern block, which allows you to create patterns or use patterns in template parts. So that&#8217;s also reusable designs that are already available to use them in templates, so you can reuse, have them on every type of page that you want to be on. That is also in the works. It definitely comes together with the UI for the patterns as well. So look out, we have the links for the PRs, will be in the show notes, so if you want to check it out and keep a tab on it, feel free to do those.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, and I think that the long and short of it is patterns are under the hood a very simple thing. It&#8217;s just a collection of blocks. And the initial implementation of patterns was just that. It was a collection of blocks that you could deploy in different places. Now that people are starting to expand and adopt block-based WordPress, it&#8217;s become very clear how powerful patterns can be. And now we&#8217;re seeing all these like, well, can it do this? Can it do this? Can we do it here? Yeah. And so we&#8217;re trying to address those things.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I just want to&#8230; Just had the idea, we talked about pattern before and I pitched that developer news post where you can have patterns for particular templates, and that&#8217;s also part of that idea where you can expand. How you can use it. How can theme developers support users in creating what they need to create on their websites and be fast with that? Yeah. So that&#8217;s also part, yeah.</p>



<p>Another thing that was definitely had a lot of questions and a lot of requests was getting revisions on the global styles for the interface. So contributors look to implement revisions and display them in the global styles. There&#8217;s current and experimental implementation that shows a separate revision menu item in the global styles. And when you selected, you can see the latest revisions, the preview of them in the editor, and you can also go back to the latest revision and change it again. Or there is also a restore of unsafe changes and also a reset to the science of the theme. So there was, the design team did lot of thinking about how that can be displayed. And now developers are working on some iterations on the PR before it&#8217;s merged. And it will certainly need some thorough testing, but I wanted listeners to know that that is coming as well.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, revisions are such a big thing when you make those changes in the site editor can be a little discerning because you&#8217;re like, I&#8217;m making all these changes. How do I get back? How do I get back to a design that I liked before and it was clicking the back button a million times or just a little&#8230; It was tough. So there&#8217;s a revision, especially visual revisions where you can go back and see what the changes that were made I think is going to be really important for broader adoption of the site editor. So great to see.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. And when users do make their own designs or make changes on their design, sometimes they don&#8217;t know what the final design looks like until they actually have it and then they don&#8217;t like it anymore and then they need to go back and that these revisions definitely will help with that process. I&#8217;m that way. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Oh, yeah.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And the last item that I have in the list for, or we have in the list for you to learn that is discussed and in the works is again, a little bit more developer oriented, but now there is a PR one issue discussed on how to get allowed blocks into the blockchain meta. It is an attribute for the inner block. So if you have a custom block and you want other blocks in there, you can restrict which blocks can be put in there, but you are not able to add this to your&#8230; A data point to your outside block. And that is something especially for developers that restrict them or they find solutions around it. And if you&#8230; Yeah, one is if you want to restrict an instance of the media and text block, that it only can do heading, paragraph, and image, but you can tell the media and text block that is what you want them to put in there. So developers do all kinds of interesting things to work around this, but there should be a standard in core and the developers are working on it.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;d love to see this extensibility. When the block editor is being built, obviously, you need the core components to be built, but I think we&#8217;re finally out of time where a lot of things are stable and now is really how do we allow people to make changes, extend different components. One of the beauties of WordPress. You can change anything. You can configure it in many ways and getting some of that configurability into more configurability into the block editor is great. So these little things that may seem minor have huge impacts for developers&#8217; lives and what they&#8217;re trying to implement. So great to see this happening.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I was thinking about, well, this is an issue that&#8217;s discussed for four years now. And finally there are enough use cases, there have been enough ways to use the block editor and extend an editor, and now there&#8217;s a real need there to actually have that discussion come to fruition into a PR or into a new feature that helps the developers to extend things. And I think we will see through the year of 2023, the next two major WordPress releases, certainly additional things that add more extensibility to the block editor, especially to the site editor and to custom blocks. And it&#8217;s exciting times and I&#8217;m really glad that we are there now just before the next phase of Gutenberg.</p>



<p>Yeah, absolutely. And with that, dear listeners, we are at the end of the show. It was a shorter show, but I&#8217;m glad I had Nick with me for you and could talk to you about a few things that are beyond the Gutenberg plugin release.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So before the end of the show. I remind you if you want to help WordPress get better, heed the call for testing, either building a block theme with a block plugin in the 20th testing call or rating front pages, different kind of front page for your website. So anything else that you want to add to things that we haven&#8217;t talked about that you were top of your mind?</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: No, just encourage people to go check out 15.6 and that call for testing. Embrace blocks and try to push the block editor to his limits. And if there are issues, let us know and we&#8217;ll help make it better.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right, so you changed jobs, Nick? Have anything but you are not new to our listeners. That&#8217;s why we kind of cut through the introduction a little bit. But have anything&#8230; If people want to get in touch with you, has anything changed?</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Nope. The best place usually is just on Twitter or obviously WordPress Slack at NDiego. On Twitter, NickMDiego. So feel free to reach out to me with your questions, comments, suggestions about WordPress. Here to help.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And we have a new video of you, Fluid Spaces.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m going to make more of those. I&#8217;m going to be trying to do more little shorts about different features that come out in WordPress so we&#8217;ll see how that goes.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And the first one is out today and we will have the link in the show notes and it talks about the spacers, spacer block. And so let Nick know what you think about and what your ideas are for new little shorts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As always, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is the 82nd edition or episode. And if you have questions or suggestions or news you want to send, include them to <a href="mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s <a href="mailto:changelog@Gutenbergtimes.com">changelog@Gutenbergtimes.com</a>. Thank you everybody, and I wish you a great weekend and a new weekend of spring eternal.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy, </p>



<p>Although, I found great content for you  and I was co-leading the Gutenberg plugin release, it felt like a quiet week. No family drama, no moving stress. Nowadays, I cherish the quiet moments, when I can sit and read a book, that&#8217;s not technical in nature. Or just sit with loved once and chat about life, or go for a walk along the Rhine. Or take a stroll through Tinguely Museum. What are your moments of quiet, you cherish, and you don&#8217;t have enough of? </p>

<p>This week, <strong>Gutenberg 15.6</strong> was released. Nick Diego and I were leading the release and published the release post: <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/04/19/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15-6-19-april/"><strong>What’s new in Gutenberg 15.6? (19 April)</strong></a>. We highlighted </p>

<p><strong>Nick Diego </strong>and I also recorded the <strong>Gutenberg Changelog episode 82</strong> together and discussed not only the latest release but also what&#8217;s in the works, like revisions for Global Styles, or a Pattern creator. It was a great pleasure speaking with Nick again on the podcast. The episode 82 will arrive at your favorite podcast app over the weekend. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/jasontheadams">Jason Adams,</a></strong> announced <strong>GiveWP&#8217;S  Block based: </strong><a href="https://givewp.com/visual-donation-form-builder-beta/"><strong>Visual Donation Form Builder in Beta</strong></a>. We discussed in an earlier edition that GiveWP is rebuilding their powerful Donation plugin with a block first mindset. The revamp started off with the WordPress own components and scripts to build the interface, and the GiveWP team augmented it with custom code where necessary. &nbsp;The Visual donation Form Builder is the first product to come from this effort.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paRW3BWsdgw">More info is also available on YouTube</a></p>



<p>If you work at an agency that helps their nonprofits fundraise using the GiveWP plugin, this beta test is for you. Furthermore, if you work at a nonprofit organization and are responsible for fundraising and building campaign related forms for your website, this beta test is for you. It gives you an early insight into what coming to GiveWP with its 3.0 version, and also a better feel for what will be possible with the new form builder that isn’t available right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> wrote tutorial on how to work with <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2023/04/per-block-css-with-theme-json/"><strong>Per-block CSS with theme.json</strong></a>. &#8220;<code>theme.json</code> supports enough CSS features to cover most common styles. But it cannot reasonably cover every scenario and still have a matching design tool in the editor UI, which is an important consideration. If the interface covered every possibility, the user experience would suffer.&#8221; Tadlock wrote. He also answers the question, why not add everything to a style.css and be done with it. Learn how to add custom CSS per block. Tadlock also added a few thoughts on pitfalls, and has some tips and tricks for you. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy, </p>



<p>250 newsletter editions. WOW. It feels like a nice round number and worth a celebration. The weekend edition of the Gutenberg Times officially became a newsletter, sent via Mailchimp, on Feb. 3rd, 2018 with 12 subscribers. It has much evolved since then. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s been a stable of my life to connect with you weekly and report on Gutenberg. After all these years (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6XqvRGDs5eLQSCyKUBCBGF?si=e4df7a8278b04efa">cue in Paul Simon</a>&#8216;s Still Crazy),  I am still infinitely curious about what people create with the block editor. Thank you for your great support and trust. It&#8217;s been a great privilege.  </p>



<p><a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/"><strong>WordCamp Europe</strong></a> is around the corner, and I would like to meet as may subscribers as possible there. <a href="https://calendly.com/pauli-haack/wordcamp-europe?month=2023-06">My public calendar is open.</a> This method worked very well, and I met an incredible mix of people at WordCamp Asia this way.  Making a deliberate effort and scheduling an appointment, adds certainty to an otherwise chance encounter in the Hallway track. I will be in town before the WordCamp, so the calendar is also open for the 7th of June, if that fits your schedule better, too.</p>



<p>I also hope to see you at the <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/contributor-day/">Contributor Day</a> on 8th of June.  <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/contributor-day/#register">Registration is open</a> for those who already have a WordCamp Europe ticket.  The organizer team of WCEU also announced that <a href="https://wptavern.com/wceu-2023-announces-free-childcare-and-workshop-for-kids">there will be free child care are and a Kids track.</a></p>



<p>As a side note, we signed the lease for our Munich flat and my husband and I will have a new permanent address starting May 1, 2023. </p>



<p>I hope, you have a fabulous weekend! </p>



<p>Yours, 💕<br><em>Birgit</em></p>

<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Hello, and welcome to our 81st episode of the Gutenberg Changelog Podcast. In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about WordPress 6.2, Gutenberg releases 15.4 and 15.5, Phase 3 of the Gutenberg project, a new proposal on the interactivity API, and so much more. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time core contributor to the WordPress Open Source Project, and I&#8217;m so thrilled to introduce to you Leonardus Nugraha as my special guest today. Leonardus is a contributor to the WordPress docs team and content specialist at Hostinger, and we personally met at WordCamp Asia and had some great meals together. So welcome to the show, Leonardus. Thank you so much for agreeing to come to the show and talk about Gutenberg with me. How are you?</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. Ah, thank you. Very good. Thank you for having me in the show. I&#8217;m good. And yeah, it&#8217;s nice to be here with your Gutenberg Changelog podcast. And it&#8217;s good to meet you again here after our in-person meetings. Yeah. It&#8217;s been two months we met in WordCamp Asia, right?</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; So it&#8217;s nice to have a chat with you again, talk about Gutenberg, talk about WordPress. Yeah. And yeah, thanks for introducing me as well. Yeah, you can call me Leo for short.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, hi, Leo.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; And yeah, content. Yeah, Leo. And as a content specialist, I curate and organize WordPress content in hosting our tutorials and blogs. And with the documentation team, I also work on mainly end user documentation articles. So yeah, my work is all about WordPress articles. Yeah, I&#8217;m loving it. I&#8217;m loving to do things and work about WordPress.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, wonderful, wonderful. Yeah. Tell us a little bit about you. Where you live and what you do for fun. Do you have family?</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, I live in Indonesia in a city named Bogor, and it&#8217;s known as Rain City.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, no.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, it rains a lot here, but it&#8217;s nice, it&#8217;s cool, it&#8217;s chill. I think personally, I love the weather. I&#8217;m not sure everyone else. Yeah, when I&#8217;m not working with content or WordPress in general, just for fun, I usually play music. I play guitar, electric guitar mainly, and listening to music on my free time, or just have fun with my dogs. I have two big dogs and I consider them as my family, to be honest.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah, of course, of course. Yeah. That&#8217;s awesome. So many of our listeners are also dog people, and I&#8217;m sure they would like to know what kind of dogs you have, and do you share photos of them somewhere online?</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha:</em>&nbsp; Yeah, one of them is a mixed breed. It&#8217;s a quite big dog. It&#8217;s about 20 kilograms. And the other one is a big golden retriever. So I have big dogs with me. I think with a combined weight, they&#8217;re bigger than me, to be honest. I love taking photos. Actually, as you may know, I&#8217;m a photography team in WordCamp, and I do have a online portfolio called <a href="https://leoandlens.com/">LeoandLens.com</a>, and I have some of photos of my docs there as well. And also WordCamp Asia photos, obviously. So, and I do have Instagram as well, and I upload or post docs, photos or just random photos there if you want to see it.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And we&#8217;ll share the links in the show notes to catch up with you online or stalk you online.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Sure.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So speaking of music, as part of the 20-year celebration coming up for WordPress, Julia Golomb published a playlist on Spotify of 20 Years of WordPress Jazz. From Miles Davis to Mikhail &#8220;Misha&#8221; Alperin. And it includes one song for each of the 45 jazz artists selected to represent the releases in the last 20 years. So this is really cool. And sometimes I just listen to it when I&#8217;m curating content, reading, copy-pasting and doing that. So yeah, what kind of music do you play?</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; To be honest, it&#8217;s not jazz, so I hope I don&#8217;t disappoint the WordPress community for that.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Mainly I listen to &#8217;80s, &#8217;90s rock and heavy metal, probably some blues and rock and roll. But as a part of WordPress committee and celebrating 20 years of WordPress, probably I should start listening to jazz.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, we have all our preferences. And some of the jazz like Django Reinhardt or something like that, it&#8217;s really great guitars showing off. So yeah, I&#8217;m not always a fan of jazz. It depends on my mood when I listen to jazz. Yeah. So yeah. So you want, let&#8217;s get further into the show.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>



<p>We have a great show coming to you, dear listeners. And for the &#8220;Community Contributions&#8221; section we have in his post, Block Visibility 3.0. A new chapter begins. Nick Diego announced that he&#8217;s making all Pro features available for free on his plugin, Block Visibility. And there are a couple of exceptions for which he needs just more time to integrate them into the free versions, but he&#8217;s aiming to pack it all in one version, make it available at no cost. And with a plugin, if you don&#8217;t know it, Block Visibility plugin, you can control, show or hide blocks depending on, for instance, a date or a user role or a location or a referral source, and it extends the core block editor with additional settings on the right. So this is a really good plugin, and it has a few fans.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely great plugins, especially if you are collaborating with big team on your WordPress site. Of course, we have user rules and user permissions, but with this plugin, you can extend the functionality and the controls with this plugin towards the blocks. And yeah, this is definitely good news to have this plugin for free for the community at no cost. And I read the blog post, and I really appreciate how Nick mentioned the importance of giving back to the community. It is all WordPress is about, right, to give to the community. And I believe with this decision, there will be more and more aspiring WordPress website owners to benefit from next creation. So yeah, everybody&#8217;s win.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, right. Everybody&#8217;s win. Yes, indeed. And since the plugin came out two years ago, I always had the hope that the core developers would consider bringing it to the core functionality of the Block Editor. Maybe that&#8217;s still in the stars, but the future is bright, so we never know what comes. But by the way, Nick Diego as a news item, joined Automattic as a full-time sponsored contributor, and I&#8217;m thrilled that he became a teammate. He has been a special guest on the show before, and I certainly see him joining again in the future. So watch out.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.2</strong></h3>



<p>Now we come to the last two weeks where a lot of releases happened, or actually four weeks since the last episode, and we&#8217;ll start with the big one, that&#8217;s WordPress 6.2. You heard us talking here on the show before. So WordPress 6.2 had over 600 contributors, and it&#8217;s the first major release in 2023.</p>



<p>The contributors come from at least 50 countries with 900 enhancements, 10 full Gutenberg releases or features from those releases, and then a slew of performance improvements. You might not be surprised to learn that Dolphy reached the impressive milestone of 2 million downloads in under two hours. So after the release and in the first week, it reached over 18 million downloads. So that&#8217;s pretty impressive. And also shows maybe there are some hosting companies that actually automatically update to new versions or at least other, there is a mechanism there that you can automatically update to the new version. And it seems to be working. So are you doing that at Hostinger, that there are automatic updates to the new version for WordPress sites?</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, we do have a feature for the users to enable auto updates, both for the minor versions and major versions. Usually we enable it for the minor versions, like 6.2.1 because usually there&#8217;s not many new features or bug fixes. Users can enable for the major updates like 6.2, but usually it&#8217;s better to have that tested on staging site as well, which Hostinger also have, to make sure the site&#8217;s working properly, there&#8217;s no compatibility issues with their plugins or with their content. So yeah, we do have that feature, but it&#8217;s safer for the users to test it first for major updates like this, especially with more than 900 enhancements and new features to the workplace.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No, totally get it. Yeah, when I was working with the agency and our client sites, we would wait at least two weeks, if not four, to see what&#8217;s happening with a new release and if there&#8217;s a patch release coming out. So yeah, test it please, dear listeners. So if you haven&#8217;t yet, the release candidate actually came out March 8th or 7th, so the last four weeks, it could have been that you could already test some of that quite extensively. So.</p>



<p>Now Rich Tabor and I discussed the site editor updates in WordPress 6.2 in the last episode, and summarize their significant updates to revamp the site editing interface to get new styling features for various blocks that were typography, styling, dimensions, and also color stylings. And then there&#8217;s a Distraction Free Writing mode and a new integration with Openverse, formerly Creative Commons Search, that enables a quick access to listen to that; 700 million free and openly licensed images and audio. So Leo, you published a blog post taking a detailed view on WordPress 6.2, and you are certainly now an expert on all the features. Have you decided what are your most exciting features for you?</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard to pick one most exciting features, because I think this release is probably, in my opinion, brings more and more enhancement compared to 6.1, 6.2, from the perspective of end users. But obviously, for me, it&#8217;s the revamped Site Editor that is really exciting to have. Finally, we have a new, fresh, clean view of the interface. And users can just switch between templates, have a preview before actually start editing. And it&#8217;s also easy to pick a template. You just click on the canvas and start editing. You don&#8217;t have to actually click the button as well. So that&#8217;s a nice little touch there. And also the Global Styles panel with the zoom in, zoom out effect. Now users can just see the whole template and how the style federations affect the site. And the style works. It&#8217;s interesting to have it, to have all the blocks previewed with the tabs. And it also works with Commerce as well.</p>



<p>If you have WooCommerce installed, you can have the new tabs for the WooCommerce blocks and the Global Style Book as well. And Openverse integration, very exciting to hear, especially when the Openverse became the part of WordPress project. It&#8217;s already exciting, but still, back then, you still have to download the content to your local computer and then re-upload to WordPress, which is a lengthy process, to be honest. And with the new integration, everything&#8217;s now works seamlessly.</p>



<p>And I really do appreciate how to developers improve it during, was it on that? I think during the beta phase when they decided to upload the image to Media Library automatically instead of just linking to the content. So that&#8217;s nice. Lastly, for me, the biggest one, everything is big, but this one, Distraction Free mode is personally my favorite. Because I don&#8217;t remember how many times I got distracted or obscured by the block toolbar. When you start a new paragraph below the headings or maybe you have some few blocks near on top of each other, sometimes the block tool can obscure the content. And it&#8217;s annoying when you have a paragraph below a heading and you want to move back to edit the heading, you have to get rid of the toolbar first. So you have to click elsewhere, and it&#8217;s complicated.</p>



<p>But now with the Distraction Free, no toolbar, I can just focus on my content, writing. And yeah, that&#8217;s the main highlight for me personally. There&#8217;s other things like copy-paste styles, which speeds up the customization process. When you pick a block that you like and you decide, &#8220;Ah, I want to use this style,&#8221; you can just copy to another one. Or you can just post it globally to apply it to all blocks on your side.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. The changing of things, you can get very granular and you can escalate some of the styles to the global styles. And I think it&#8217;s quite intuitive to do that. But the Distraction Free mode is definitely one of the, I&#8217;m so glad that came to core. There was a plugin available called Iceberg by Rich Tabor and Jeffrey Caradang for a long time, and they actually created a Distraction Free mode. And I really loved it when I was doing some journaling, where you don&#8217;t need any pictures or something like that, you&#8217;re just channel your inner self or inner mom or inner dad and just write. And that makes it much better writing experience. And I think quite a few bloggers were put off by the block toolbar that gets in the way every time. And there was this, or there is still this feature that you can patch or stick the toolbar to the top, but you still get all the distractions from other things.</p>



<p>You move the mouse and something happens, and then it goes. And it&#8217;s just sometimes a little noisy. So the Distraction Free mode is definitely beneficial. I also like to surface some great material around the Site Editor for educators. So with WordCamps and conferences on the horizon, meetups are getting re-energized to meet in place, face-to-face meetings and localities, presentations need to be prepared. And Anne McCarthy has a post on her personal blog that&#8217;s called, &#8220;So you want to talk about Site Editor, Part Four.&#8221; And gives you all the resources that would need to speed up your preparations for any presentations. And of course, we&#8217;ll share that in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gutenberg 15.4</strong></h3>



<p>So that brings us to the next Gutenberg plugin release. Gutenberg 15.4 was released. Justin Tadlock and Ryan Welcher handled it and it contained 186 PRs with 57 contributors. Six of them were first-timers, so congrats all around.</p>



<p>And it was a smaller release, because it also had a few bug fixes for the 6.2 that were doing the beta and release backported, as the techies say, to the release version of 6.2.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>



<p>So there are a few enhancements I wanted to talk about. So one is go direct to edit from a &#8220;Manage all template&#8221; list. That&#8217;s something you just mentioned, Leo, that you see the template in the preview and the Template Editor or in the Site Editor, you see the template. And then you click on it, and you&#8217;re right there in the edit mode for the template. And that came with 15.4, you mentioned it. Now you also see in the panel on the left-hand side, the PR says, &#8220;The Site Editor&#8217;s dark side.&#8221; Which, it&#8217;s not philosophical, it&#8217;s the black sidebar on the left-hand side. And now there are descriptions for each of the templates. So you know a little bit more when a theme comes in or you enable a new theme, what the templates are supposed to do. And theme editors are able to add templates as well.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, I think the description, I didn&#8217;t really notice at first when the full Site Editor came to WordPress, but I think having description for its templates like 404 or &#8220;Single post&#8221; or &#8220;Archive,&#8221; it helps many, many first-time users, WordPressers who are still learning. Having this description will be great for them, definitely.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And when you switch theme or have Template Parts or create new ones, you also get a signal from who created them, and from which theme do they come over. That is a signal for the future, where there is thinking about how to make Template Parts and templates less reliant on particular theme. So when you switch the theme and you created a new template as a site owner, you want the template to come over to the new theme as well and not just go away with the old theme. So there&#8217;s some big thinking to be done, because that can get complex so fast.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. But that will really relevant with the next phase, which is collaboration, to have Template Parts and templates stick to the WordPress instead of the themes. And you can know which user create the template, or whether it&#8217;s made from the themes. So yeah, hopefully it&#8217;s a great path to the future.</p>



<p>So yeah, we can move on to the next one. It&#8217;s a navigation sidebar. So we have the new logic, which navigation to be shown on the dark side, as you mentioned. I think the first iteration, it shows the first navigation that is created on the team or templates. And now it shows the latest one that is published, which in my opinion, it&#8217;s really logical. It&#8217;s a good step because most likely users will use the latest one and the latest navigation block that they made.</p>



<p>But yeah, this is definitely still something, in my opinion, can be improved further, especially with the James Koster&#8217;s idea about having a label or hint to identify which menu actually been shown on the dark side. As for now, if you change the menu on the block tools, the navigation block tools, which on the right side, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t really change the one on the dark side. So you can switch to the older menu on the block tools, but then the dark side stick. And yeah, sometimes it can be confusing for new users. So hopefully, we are moving to the right direction here, in my opinion. But definitely, James Koster&#8217;s idea is definitely something worth to think about and to have labeling or hint, especially for new users again, who are still learning.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I think there was a reason why the navigation part was actually pulled from 6.2. It&#8217;s now coming back with a Gutenberg plugin, but it was pulled from the 6.2 because it was still not performing to the quality that I want. And it wasn&#8217;t really all that intuitive, because the sidebar, when you actually edit a navigation block on the sidebar, it behaves differently than what was on the left side. So that was good. I think it was a good decision, even late in the cycle. That&#8217;s what the next part is, the height navigation screen, that was in 15.4 and was backported to 6.2.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, I remember testing it on the beta and the RC. The experience is still not perfect yet, I remember, because why is it different between the block tools and the sidebar? And then I heard the news from AN and that it&#8217;s backported again put from 6.2. So yeah, for me, it&#8217;s perfectly make sense. And hopefully they can deliver it, on the next layer is 6.3. They can get everything perfect with a perfect experience for users. And yeah.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Good. Yeah, the Cover Block now also has constrained flow layout, which means that it can be used in different context, and then applied the block inner wrapper by default. And it means that the layered support will work in the Cover Block the same way as it does for the group block, but without the facts variations. So you cannot change how the Cover Block children behave in the full end wide alignment of the Cover Block context. I don&#8217;t know if that makes sense.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, I think it makes sense for the Cover Block. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, the FontSizePicker, that&#8217;s just a small note here that the FontSizePicker now allows custom units for theme developers that you can offer to your users. It before was only using pixels, and what was the other one?</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; RVM?</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh yeah, RVM. Yeah, or EMs. And now you can use all of them that are possible. Like VW and all that. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And on the next one we have new block support. So have a text column, or column support on the typographic settings. So I think on this PR, the example, the great example is the paragraph block. So usually if you have a paragraph block, it&#8217;s just like a block of text. But now with this text column support, you can add columns, the number of columns. So you can split the paragraph into separate columns without actually using a column blocks, which is a great option if you want to customize your content, maybe make it like a newspaper style. You don&#8217;t have to use the column block separately. You can just split your paragraph into columns.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. And it adjusts if you add more text to it and adjust the columns to it. And it&#8217;s great that there&#8217;s now typography support available, so you can actually change fonts or make them larger, smaller, or change the line height. What might be needed when you are in smaller columns, you can reduce the line height on your texts. So those controls are now available in the user interface. But one caveat on this, the text columns is only available when the theme actually enables it. It&#8217;s not coming out of the box yet, so you need to adjust the theme a little bit to actually be able to use that.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, I think it used to, you have to add a little bit of code to make it enabled in the theme that JSON file, right?</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Correct. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; For now.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, for now. And I need to figure out maybe next release, there will be a way to enable it as a site builder with not access to code to also make use of it. And the Cover Block now got Text Scholar Block support. I was thinking, &#8220;Okay, that didn&#8217;t happen before.&#8221; But obviously it didn&#8217;t, because it&#8217;s now in the plugin. Yes, those design tools are rolled out to the core blocks one at a time to enable them and then test them, to make sure that they&#8217;re work in every context nicely.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; And the next one, adding compound class to layout wrapper or global style spacing. Maybe you can cover this.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So the problem was that the Cover Block didn&#8217;t work out of the box. The covers mark up the structure and they needed to change the classes to make them also available to the float. And so the Cover Block was a little bit revamped to specify target wrapper for the class, and for the layout of the object. So it was hard to target things that are inside the inner blocks. So that was a revamp that was necessary. So those who style themes can actually access those easily and style them. There was a specificity problem, I think. So for theme developers, they will make sense of it. So the spacing wasn&#8217;t clear for the block children. It was random inside the Cover Block. So they changed that and fixed it. It was a long way around it, explaining it, but sorry. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, so developer focus one. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, seem develop the styles. Yeah, CSS. And sometimes I have a hard time with it.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>



<p>So now we come to the bug fixes, those were all the enhances of the 15.4 Gutenberg plugin release. We have, I think only two bug fixes that we want to point out, because sometimes you want to know when a bug is fixed. And the first one is that to ensure that the aspect ratio selected is also applied to the post feature image block, and in the Post Template block. So it shows up when you have a summary page, and you have the featured image with the blocks in a grid, that the aspect ratio is actually applied to the post featured block. That&#8217;s really important. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; I remember I was having problem with featured image ratio quite a long time ago, but I didn&#8217;t realize that it&#8217;s actually a bug. So yeah, I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s fixed now with the 15.4. And I think the aspect ratio option is only available when you actually enable the link option for the featured image, right?</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was the problem. And then for the navigation block, there is a major bug fix that when the input, the classic menu using in the menu name, that it&#8217;s also going to be the title for the block menu. So there is a seamless integration there. And people are not getting confused. They did not take my menu that I wanted to, or didn&#8217;t do it when you imported a classic menu. So this is fixed now with the Gutenberg 5.4. What else is in there?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; I think this pull request in the demonstration, it&#8217;s actually hide the Meta Box at the bottom by default. Previously it shows the Meta Box when you&#8217;re in a certain width, but now it just hidden. So the interface is much more cleaner than ever now.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, Distraction Free. Don&#8217;t get distracted.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yes.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The Meta Boxes, yes. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; It&#8217;s small, but sometimes people can get distracted by that, even though it&#8217;s this small thing at the bottom.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. Yeah. But if you have multiple custom fields or something like that, that can be quite long. So it&#8217;s good to hide it. Yes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>



<p>And then there are quite a few documentation changes, and I want to mention them. So your listeners, you can go and look them up. They added examples on how programmatically remove the panels in the document sidebar. So if you don&#8217;t want featured image or don&#8217;t want the tags or the categories, now developers can look up how to actually remove those for their plugins, or for their theme, or the bespoke agency theme development.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; And then the next one is for the sticky position documentation. So I think this relates to the new sticky position features site. So this also been added to documentation.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And that also fills in with a second one that we…</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Oh, yeah.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Which is, so the theme, JSON Schema now has two places where the sticky option is mentioned, and it didn&#8217;t before, but it&#8217;s now in the controls for the appearance tools. When you set them for true, there&#8217;s also a sticky option there. And then you can also in these further down in the Schema, you can add the sticky positions, and minimum height for the styles section as well. So that is now all documented, and you can look up how it works and how it helps you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gutenberg 15.5</strong></h3>



<p>And I think that&#8217;s the Changelog for Gutenberg 15.4, and we are now right into the Changelog for the latest Gutenberg 15.5 release that was released Wednesday, April 4th. And was again, the team Ryan Welcher and Justin Tadlock. April 5th, sorry. And it has 143 PRs with 52 contributors and some updates there. So the first enhancement is that the post date now block has now a variation to use the modified date rather than the published date. And it&#8217;s really important when you have a new site, and you want to get the updated post higher into the latest news, then you want to use the modified date. So it bubbles up again. &#8220;Okay, look here. There were changes in that and it&#8217;s still important.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And this is also great for end user as well, in my opinion, because this is basically the same block with this variation, with the modified date enabled by default. But for new users, it&#8217;s just much easier to find having a separate post date and post modified date. So if they want to show both in the single Post Template, they can just find these blocks without having to fiddle with the settings. So yeah, it&#8217;s a much more seamless and easier work process, workflow. And then similar to the post that we have &#8220;Time to Read&#8221; block, which I believe was released on 15.3. It was right?</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; And now we have a plethora of settings like typographic support to the &#8220;Time to Read&#8221; block, and also spacing tool. So after this was introduced in 15.3, with 15.5, now you can customize the typography and the spacing tools.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Sorry, go ahead.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; No, I&#8217;m finished.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, no, I used it. So the &#8220;Time to Read&#8221; was actually already available in the outline of the post when you were in the block editor. You could see &#8220;Time to Read.&#8221; Two minutes, 15 minutes, yeah, 25 minutes. Never going to read that. But then immediately as it was available, people were asking, &#8220;Well, can I use that information also on my front end so I can notify or I can show it with my post grid or something like that? How long the Time to Read for that?&#8221; So because readers like that, they found. And it took a while to get it right, to get a new block in and figure out what&#8217;s the best approach. So it now only shows a number and the minutes, and that was the easiest way to make it available through all the languages, because each locale works differently with minutes, three minutes kind of thing in different languages.</p>



<p>So now you can put them in a row with your wording. So Time to Read, 15 minutes. The &#8220;Time to Read&#8221; is a paragraph, and then you stack it with a row. Group block, in a group block with the &#8220;Time to Read&#8221; block, and then you can have that in your Post Template block. So what did happen was that when I was testing it, I saw immediately that my default font size was different for the paragraph as it was for the Time to Read, but I didn&#8217;t have any controls to change that for the Time to Read. So I filed an issue and said, &#8220;Okay, I need typography control there, please.&#8221; And then I also thought, &#8220;Okay, I need some spacing as well,&#8221; because it was a little lower than the Time to Read. It was really weird. I figured it out for my personal blog, but then also found that it would probably be best to have both controls available to that.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And in case everyone wondering, it is actually possible to have Time to Read information previously, but you have to code it to your theme or install a plugin specific for that function. So yeah, it&#8217;s nice to have it in Gutenberg. And hopefully, in the future it&#8217;ll push to the core as well.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; So the next one, oh yeah, the sticky position. I think this feature didn&#8217;t have chance to see the light of day, because when the feature is added, it&#8217;s now reverted back. But essentially, there was a pull request to enable Template Part blocks to be sticky, which is perfectly logical. Because if you have a header, you want to have a sticky header, that means you have to make the Template Part for the header sticky. So there&#8217;s this pull request that adds that feature, but the way it worked was adding the Template Parts into a group block, which is already have the sticky position support, but that doesn&#8217;t really consistent with how the Template Part works. So we are now referred back to how it was, you cannot make it sticky anymore. But yeah, the idea is there. So hopefully, this will be a good starter to see, to look for a better solution for this one. Because yeah, I think many users will want to have Template Part header to be sticky instead of they have to use a group block on route level.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And it&#8217;s quite unintuitive to figure out, &#8220;Okay, if I want to make it sticky, I need to put it in a group block, but it&#8217;s already a Template Part. Can&#8217;t we have that support just for the Template Part?&#8221; But yeah, that adds definitely to the complexity, because the Template Part sometimes doesn&#8217;t have, the sticky doesn&#8217;t know where to stick it, so to speak. When the Template Part is further down the page, then it&#8217;s hard where to stick it to. And yeah, where is it located? Is the Template Part on the sidebar? Then you have a sticky sidebar, but the sticky sidebar behaves totally differently from a sticky header or a sticky footer. So when you read through the PRs, your head might spin because it really shows the discussion between the designers.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; It&#8217;s just the complexity.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s totally complex. Yeah, just take it from us. It&#8217;s a complex thing.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; I just skip to Rich Tabor feedback about how it doesn&#8217;t really sit with the consistency of the sticky position as well. Because on this PR, you make it sticky, I think to the Ellipsis menu instead of from the block tools. So it will create a different experience.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And the same complexity we will enter when you make the experiment available on, so there is a new feature in 15.5 that&#8217;s first take on the grid layout group variation. So we have flex layouts, we have flow layouts, and now the designers and developers try to get it working with the grid layout. And if you want to try it, you need to enable it through the experiments menu item on the Gutenberg plugin menu item, and check that part to test it out. But please do test it. Because if you want it to get out of experiments and then into the Gutenberg plugin by default and then further into WordPress, it needs to be really working well. And all the use cases, people cannot think up about all the use cases that you would use it. So yeah, please test it and give feedback on the PRs. Or create new issues on the Gutenberg repo so the developers have a better feel from what is still missing and how it&#8217;s not working. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. I just test the feature for a few minutes after the launch, because this is also on the launch post. So it&#8217;s quite interesting. And I love it because it was only after this update, I just realized that if you want to create a block, a grid layout with, let&#8217;s say, three columns and three rows, you have to mix it with row blocks or stack blocks, and you just create the whole complex structure. But now with the grid layout, it can just go straight out from the box with the way you want. You can have four columns, you can have six rows, maybe. And yeah, it&#8217;s nice to have this variation. I already tested, even though just few minutes, but I already see possibilities to use this layout for my website, my portfolio website.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, it&#8217;s great when those new features actually trigger some creativity on &#8220;Well, how can I use it? Yeah. Can I push it to the limits?&#8221; And that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all for. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; And the great thing is it&#8217;s not something that I have in mind. So previously, okay, row blocks, type blocks, columns blocks, that works, but now you have a grid. &#8220;Oh my God, I can have that all in one now.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And that was quite a few themes developers or theme builders were actually missing that, because grids came in to the CSS part, I think it was in &#8217;16 or 2017, and it&#8217;s been a while that other web developers were able to use it in different settings. But WordPress didn&#8217;t have. There was a plugin or there is a plugin where Automattic created some grid layouts. But now that this is in core, I think we can push it really further into the internet, so to speak. There&#8217;s another item that now you can actually style the caption element, also via the UI controls for color and topography. That&#8217;s the caption for the image…</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Image block.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Image block, yeah, and Video block and Table block and all that. So now we have that, but it seems to have also the UI for you were able to do this via the theme JSON, but now you can do it without using the code for it.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. You can access it through the global style panels for typography, there will be a new caption options, and the color as well.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; So yeah, the next one, we have the patterns to the template start modal. So when you add new templates now instead of having a fallback default templates, you can have this options to pick a pattern to start with. So yeah, this is also interesting, because in my opinion, this is a perfect middle ground. I remember when the Site Editor came in 5.9, when you add a new template, you start with blank canvas, which is quite daunting, to be honest. And then it was fixed in the feature of this 6.2, 6.0, I can&#8217;t remember that one. But basically, now you can choose it with the black templates and a default fallback template, which is great. But the problem is if you have different ideas with the default templates, you basically have to modify the existing template. You can remove some blocks, and you have to add more blocks. But now with the increasing number of patterns and increasing number of the pattern adoption by the theme developers, it&#8217;s nice to have just simply options to add patterns for the template and choose whatever suits your needs.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, the blank page is not good for anybody, not for writers and not for style, for theme builders. So what&#8217;s next?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; It&#8217;s quite a lot showing the featured images placeholders. Again, this is something I didn&#8217;t realize at first. Is it Blockfish? Oh, no, it&#8217;s block library. Yeah. It&#8217;s something that I didn&#8217;t realize previously that sometimes the featured image doesn&#8217;t show on the Query Loop block when there&#8217;s no featured set for the certain post. But I think now when you&#8217;re in the Site Editor and some posts may have a featured image and some don&#8217;t, the post with featured image will show the featured image on the Query Loop. And the post that doesn&#8217;t have any featured image will have this gray placeholder so you know that the featured image will be there.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Or say, &#8220;Oh,&#8221; and if I want that design, it alerts you to not every post can help you with that design because there is no featured image. So it gets a little bit skewed there, where the headline comes up on the top of the image to the next post. Yeah, so it really helps with what you see is what you get kind of approach. Yeah. Yeah, there was quite a daunting bug there. And then the one other bug fix was that the Selecta&#8217;s API, the hook for the global style variation and Duotone has been fixed, and it&#8217;s now behaving consistently throughout the site. There&#8217;s a whole list of PRs that are with that. Not all of them are actually placed in, but this is definitely a very major fix to revamp the code consistency and code quality for it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>



<p>All right. And this was Gutenberg 5.5. I&#8217;m glad that they were a little smaller as plug-in releases, because first, we got two and then, but we also have a lot to talk about what&#8217;s in active development and what&#8217;s discussed. And I prefixed that next section for the section is, we will include three and a half topics to talk about. First we talk about a little bit about Matias Ventura&#8217;s post on the next phase of the Gutenberg project, Phase 3. And there&#8217;s also work being done on making content and template editing less confusing, and then a proposal on the interactivity API by core contributors. And the half-topic is the design shares by Joen Asmussion from the WordPress design team showed what they are working on. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Let&#8217;s start with Phase 3. Personally for me, this is the most excitingness of the year, probably, ever since Matt mentioned it on the State of the Word, that this year we are moving to Phase 3 with real-time collaboration. Personally, I believe if the Phase 3 is what I have in mind, and officially just like what Matias posted on his blog post. This is my personal take, but I really think, I believe that it will be a game changer in the content industry. Because right now, we rely on other tools like Google Docs to collaborate and create the draft for the content and then push it on the WordPress, which, it&#8217;s now better with the Block Editor, but still, you have to move the draft, you still have to clean the code, you still have to move the image with the alt tags. So if the Phase 3 finally mature, this can significantly improve the workflow and the pace of the content industry. So yeah, I really hope the Phase 3 gets underway as soon as possible. And let&#8217;s see how the development then. Definitely can&#8217;t wait for that.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m totally with you. The other, I think the whole web development and web content creators of the last 25 years is actually waiting for this, that two people at the same time or four people at the same time can access a post and edit it. And not the last person who&#8217;s clicks saves wins. So yes, I think that, and bringing that to a web editor is certainly cutting down on the workflow of a lot of people that had to collaborate on Google Docs to get input from other people, to get approval from other people. So that definitely is that real-time collaboration part that Matias Ventura was talking about in his post. What he also sees is that there are asynchronous collaboration. That if Leo in Indonesia is writing a post, and I&#8217;m in America and that&#8217;s 12 hours apart, I want to comment on it, and it&#8217;s really hard right now to do this because there is no revision comments.</p>



<p>There is no comments at all unless you have a plugin. There were always a few things already, a plugin there. So PublishPress is one, and then Edit Flow that took care of some of that, but you weren&#8217;t able to customize it to your own liking. And then he also talks about the published flows where you have publishing checklists. So is the image rate in the aspect ratio? Do we have an excerpt? Do we have all the categories and tags, and do we have a different image for the header section and for the footer section? Or when different contacts can have different publish flows. So that is definitely going to be a little bit more complicated to make it extensible. And then also the post revisions interface, it&#8217;s really hard right now to see what really changed when you have a long post from one revisions to the next.</p>



<p>And this Phase 3 is aiming to make it understand blocks, and then also help you with theme switching as well as applying some other styles. And also have revisions that are scheduled. We have on the documentation team, yeah, Leo, you probably know this better than I do, but if you want to prepare for a release, you need to wait till the release is out, so you can publish it, publish the new version of your documents. But not everybody has time to wait for the release and be there in the middle of a night, and hit the publish button or the save button. You definitely want to schedule that. And yeah, we use a plugin for that, but having that in core would be definitely, we are not the only ones who have that trouble. Yeah, yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, definitely.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; But with the post revision interface, I think that&#8217;s the main, when talking about collaboration, people might think about real time and asynchronous collaboration. But post revisions are as important as the other ones. Because when you collaborate, especially with bigger themes, you really want to see not only what part has been changed, but who made the change to keep the accountability and content to be as good as possible. And to make sure there&#8217;s no mistake in the process. So yeah, and I think, I&#8217;m not sure, did Matias actually talk about this, but with the collaboration is now on WordPress, there must be some thinking to grant more access to collaborators, maybe from links and maybe how to control the user&#8217;s permissions. So I believe that&#8217;s something to tackle as well on the first three.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely will, especially the post revision interface. And although it will need different user roles for different things to do, and I know that bigger publishing houses, they have that really huge requirement that they need to have people access the images but not the text kind of thing or vice versa. And yeah, there&#8217;s definitely a part of the development will be about user roles and user capabilities that come with the publishing flow, for sure. There&#8217;s also the admin design. There was a separate post by Matias back in January, I think, that was thinking about through the WordPress admin experience. And that will now be part of the collaboration phase, where certain pieces of the admin definitely would need a revamp, like how we organize posts. What&#8217;s in the post you need for the collaboration you need, yeah, when was it revisioned?</p>



<p>Does that need to be in the list view of things? And all that kind of thing. And then also have a library. Expansion, that means spaces where you can manage your patterns, where you can manage your blocks, your styles and your fonts on the site, or at least for the site admin to be able to do that. Right now, there&#8217;s the two, all four of them that I&#8217;ve just mentioned. And the Matias mentioned in his post where are actually missing, and it&#8217;s felt quite a bit throughout the five years that the Block Editor is there, especially the blocks where you can switch on and switch off blocks in the interface. But then if you have third-party blocks, you don&#8217;t know which of the blocks have you used or which post uses which block. So you can switch it over to a different one when you say, &#8220;Okay, I want to remove the plugin.&#8221; But all of a sudden, some of your content disappears as well.</p>



<p>So there definitely needs to be a little bit more manageable space there. And then the last item is develop a global search and command component where you can say, &#8220;Okay, edit post in a search box,&#8221; and then it opens up the &#8220;Edit post&#8221; admin screen. So you don&#8217;t have to click through all the different levels of things. That&#8217;s the idea behind it. So I&#8217;m not sure if we do it really justice, going through those different sections of the collaboration post by Matias. Give it a read. It&#8217;s definitely is a little bit more expanded at what we are doing here. And see, and especially what Matias Ventura is asking and the whole core contributors are asking. So if there&#8217;s something that you are doing on your website and you want it in one part of the collaboration, because it fits in that scope, but it wasn&#8217;t yet mentioned, comment on the post, describe your flow, and see if that&#8217;s something that could be in core.</p>



<p>Nothing is, of course, prominent at this stage because I haven&#8217;t started working on it yet. So in the WP Briefing podcast, Episode 52, Josepha Haden Chomphosy and Hector Prieto also talking about the Phase 3, the workflows, the visioning about it. So it&#8217;s another version of it, and you probably can hear more about it. All right. So I mentioned it before, is also work being done, and we&#8217;ll share the links to the PR and discussions in the show notes.</p>



<p>Users repeatedly mentioned that they sometimes get confused of what they are actually editing in the Site Editor. And then they see a page and make updates to the content, and then they&#8217;re surprised that page template, actually, that they&#8217;re actually changed the page template. And that the content that they changed or that they added is replicated on all the pages because it was a template. So that&#8217;s quite a surprising thing, and it&#8217;s nowhere really alerted that that might happen. So the developers and designers are really working hard to make it a seamless switch from editing your content to editing a template. And there are two, there&#8217;s one PR that actually caters to that, but then there is a bigger effort to optimize also the content-centric editing experience in the site editor. So I&#8217;ll share those in the side notes. Show notes, side notes, show notes. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; It&#8217;s definitely a nice addition to the Site Editor. I remember when the browse mode first mentioned in past updates, I believe, this is actually what I had in mind. Users can browse their websites, can open pages and blog post to the Site Editors. And when they want to edit the content, they can just switch from editing the templates and just editing the page or post they&#8217;re browsing in. And I think with the new navigation UI in the site bar or the dark side of the Site Editor, it&#8217;s like that already. We can see the menu items in there and just click on it, and you can see the page. And if you click it, you can edit the page on the Site Editor. So yeah, it&#8217;s already in the good direction now. So it&#8217;s only the matter of expanding it to be more integrated between the Site Editors and put editor, and the post and page editor.</p>



<p>To be honest, when the first Site Editor came out in 5.9, this is also my first issue, figuring out what is the new Site Editor? And I just click it. &#8220;Okay, this is the template, so how do I edit the post or page? Oh, I still have to go to the old post and page editor.&#8221; Because in my mind, it was a page builder or website builder, but it&#8217;s not right. So it took me a while to understand what it is. And now we are working to integrate the Site Editor and the content editor better. So in the future, we might have a better experience with Block Editor and seamless content editing.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And for a newer WordPress user, the difference between the page and the template for the page, that&#8217;s a certain cognitive hurdle there. An abstraction level that not everybody who wants to get their work done wants to deal with. So it&#8217;s definitely something that needs to be handled, but it&#8217;s also sometimes really hard to make that intuitive. And if the context is not known with a switch, so it&#8217;s going to be a training. Sometimes we always think that web editing should be something like using a car, without forgetting that we went to traffic school before we actually learned driving. And we don&#8217;t want have traffic school for the web there. So we need to make a compromise there.</p>



<p>I also wanted to point the more the developers amongst our listeners to the proposal for an interactivity API that a team of contributors has worked almost a year around it to figure out how can this be standardized. There is, of course, available any of the block builders or block developers or third-party blocks or core blocks. There is some interactivity already available, but it&#8217;s not standardized. And standardization also means that developers don&#8217;t have to relearn everything. Users don&#8217;t have to relearn everything every time they have a new plugin. And also, you can share data. So if one plugin knows about the block of another plugin, then new things and better things can happen. So Mario Santos published a proposal for the Interactivity API.</p>



<p>And for those of us who need a practical application to think through the abstractions there, it&#8217;s all very theoretically, Mario also put in a video demo of a movie database, where in you can browse the site publicly and developers can look at the code of things. But the video shows two use cases for add an interactivity to that movie directory. And navigating the directory is already by search, and that is one of the interactivity API, because it doesn&#8217;t go back to the server and reloads things. That&#8217;s pretty much what it abstracts is that only parts of the data will be replaced on the site, but it will not go back to reload the whole page that you&#8217;re looking at. And then the other one is click on hearts to favorite some of the movies. And it also has a favorite counter on that. So these kind of interactivity, that&#8217;s a simple example that we can all rely on or relate to.</p>



<p>And then there is the whole proposal itself. As a developer, you learn about directives, you see some code examples, and the FAQ also answers some of the more in-depth questions you might have. The post has already 40 comments. So grab a cup of coffee, put on some nice, slow music and read through it. It&#8217;s almost a book, but it&#8217;s very, very interesting in terms of what can actually happen when we standardize things. And then there is next week, no. Okay, so I don&#8217;t want to count it because I don&#8217;t know when you are listening to it. So two developers from the team who came up with a proposal will be speakers of the Developer Hours on April 17. I don&#8217;t know if you know about Developer Hours, but they had been revitalized from an experiment last year where you can connect with developers on the core team and have questions answered.</p>



<p>And this time has a little bit of a different format, when there is an introduction to the interactivity API. And they will hold two events to accommodate as many time zones as possible. One is at 8:00 AM UTC. And the other one, that&#8217;s with Mario Santos. And the other one is at 17:00 UTC. That&#8217;s going to be with Michal Czamplinski. And yeah, so that is actually the next generation of block development getting more interactivity into, it&#8217;s called a hydration process, where things come from the server. Yeah, it&#8217;s a connecting PHP with JavaScript and just update the necessary data on the front end upon user interactions. That&#8217;s pretty much the explanation for it. Yeah, so I don&#8217;t know if you have any comments on that, Leo?</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Nope.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Because I&#8217;m more of an end user in this regard.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And what you see in the demo is actually quite impressive, because you see the seamless, that there is no time lost between changing different screens. So that&#8217;s really cool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So there are two articles in the show notes, one from the Tavern and one the proposal. And then if you as a developer or want to be a developer kind of person, share or join those two developer hours with Michal and Mario. And the last thing, the half about topic for, what&#8217;s in the works is Joen Asmussen&#8217;s Design Share from March 27th on the &#8220;Make WordPress Design,&#8221; make blog. And he shares what&#8217;s happening, with one is that the mercantile store, the swag store gets some social images that are designed. Then the design team also thinks through making the padding and margin controls a little bit more intuitive and see how to provide easily clickable preset sizes and unlink variations, and take a look at it.</p>



<p>And he connects with the PRs on issues that are on the GitHub repo. They also have a visual idea on how to scale the Block Options menu. That gets really long now to cluster some of them, and then you can access and an arrow with a secondary menu item there. That&#8217;s quite nice. And then he had, the last one is the ideation of the Template Management view where he has a small video to mock up the view toggle patterns to moving between the browsing and the managing context. So that&#8217;s pretty much the topic that we talked before about content-centric Site Editor kind of thing. So they&#8217;re, of course, design, it&#8217;s all visuals. And we are here on a podcast, so it&#8217;s really hard. But we have the link in the show notes for you, so you can browse them at your own leisure. Yeah. All right.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; The block option in particular caught my eye because as you say, the block options get longer and longer over time. So it is quite short. But then we have block locking tools, we have &#8220;Create Template Part&#8221; options. We now have a copy style and paste styles. I mean, if we have a minimized Windows Manager, try to open the options, so you might have to scroll it down just to find the bottom ones. So yeah, it&#8217;s nice to have the new designs to just split it and with the sub-menus. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. You still need the space on the right-hand side when they pop out. So if there are too many options, it&#8217;s not enough room. But yeah, gradual adoption is pretty much the keyword word for that. Yeah. All right. This is the end of the Gutenberg Changelog Episode 81. Thank you so much for listening, people. Leo, thank you so much for being here and talking this through. You did an excellent job. It was wonderful to have the chat with you, and I really enjoyed it, being on the show with you. So you mentioned…</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You mentioned a few links to your social web. If you can repeat the website where you have your portfolio for the photography, that would be great.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, the website is <a href="https://leoandlens.com/">Leo and Lens</a>. I will type it down for you later, and maybe you can put it on the show notes.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: There&#8217;s no maybe about it.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Thank you. Yeah. And yeah, lastly, thank you all, listeners, for listening to this episode. Thank you, Birgit, for having me. It&#8217;s such an honor to be in the Gutenberg Changelog podcast with you.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It was definitely, the pleasure was all mine. And well, I might ask you to maybe come back in the future. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Leonardus Nugraha</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, yeah, just contact me. I&#8217;ll definitely be happy to be in here again and talk about Gutenberg, about WordPress and how it evolves. Yeah, it is a great pleasure for me.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you. Yeah, and as always, hey listeners, the show notes will be published on GutenbergTimes.com/podcast. This is Episode 81. And if you have questions or suggestions or news you want us to include, send them to <a href="mailto:Changelog@Gutenbergtimes.com">Changelog@Gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s email <a href="mailto:Changelog@Gutenbergtimes.com">Changelog@Gutenbergtimes.com</a>.

</ul>



<p>I am particularly, curious about how the grid layout works. It seems quite complex as the editor needs to deal with several levels and Inner Blocks and how they follow the overall grid layout. It&#8217;s important that theme builders test this and provide feedback, so it can be solidified. </p>

Ritner and his team at Kadence theme were early adopters of the Block editor and built a very popular Block Collection plugin. Together with the Kadence Theme, the plugin elevated the user experience to page building capabilities with features the block editor was missing for a long time. There are still things Ritner finds missing. Read  the article and see if his gaps are also relevant to your theme building journey. </p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/santosguillamot">Mario Santos</a></strong> posted on the Make Core blog the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks/"><strong>Proposal: The Interactivity API – A better developer experience in building interactive blocks</strong></a>.  The vision:  &#8220;Imagine plugins providing interactions like “heart this post” or “add to cart” without page reloads. Picture instant search, commenting, and native full-page transitions as best-in-class built-ins without complex scaffolding or external tools. Envision achieving this in any block theme by default without sacrificing&nbsp;PHP&nbsp;server rendering and the&nbsp;plugin&nbsp;ecosystem for a&nbsp;JS&nbsp;runtime. Visualize block developers easily declaring and extending such behaviors in a way that is immediately familiar and compatible with the block ecosystem.&#8221; </p>



<p>Santos also shared a short demo of  Favorites in a Movies app. You can <a href="https://wpmovies.dev/">browse it yourself on the live site</a>, and if you are interested in the implementation, the <a href="https://github.com/wordpress/wp-movies-demo">demo code is also available on GitHub</a>. This post definitely has a high Geek-factor, but the aim is to make it easier for any developer to create interactive blocks. Stay tuned for more examples and examples code.</p>

<p><strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> and <strong>Ryan Welcher</strong> co-led the <strong>Gutenberg 15.4</strong> plugin release.

<p><strong>Matias Ventura</strong>, lead developer of the Gutenberg projects, posted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/"><strong>Phase 3: Collaboration</strong></a> and explored briefly, what the next phase of the Gutenberg project would encompass. He identified seven areas: </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Real-time collaboration</strong> &#8211; more than one person can edit a post at the same time.</li>



<li><strong>Asynchronous collaboration.</strong> Writers and editors share drafts and discuss via a comments assignments, topics etc. This part is all about workflow among a team of editors. </li>



<li><strong>Publishing flows.</strong> Publishing checklists, managing requirements and allowing for customization as every site has different needs. </li>



<li><strong>Post revisions interface.</strong> A way to coordinate updates and add new content in a scheduled manner.  There will be overlap with Theme switching and applying styles, for instance for Christmas, or other occasions. </li>



<li><strong>Admin design.</strong> Ventura wrote about this last year in <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/06/13/thinking-through-the-wordpress-admin-experience/">Thinking Through the WordPress Admin Experience</a>. Notifications, list views updated UI to include new features. </li>



<li><strong>Library</strong> &#8211; A space where users manage Patterns, Blocks, Styles, and Fonts. </li>



<li>Develop a <strong>global search &amp; command component</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>I just briefly touched on the seven areas, and might not do it full justice. Ventura provided in his post many more details. <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/">It&#8217;s worth a read</a>.  Give it time to digest, too. Then, see if there is something you are missing, that would fit into the third phase and share it in the comments on the post. </p>

<p><strong>Ryan Welcher</strong> posted last week&#8217;s Twich stream session to YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32Ohee5fos0"><strong>Reviewing Gutenberg 15.3 features. Live stream: March 16, 2023</strong></a>. He went over the features of the Gutenberg 15.3 plugin. He discussed the new time to read block and showed how it works and also highlighted the improvements made to the duotone design tool. Welcher also elaborated on the fast release cycle of Gutenberg and how it can sometimes result in smaller updates. Another topic was the process of creating custom duotones and Welcher suggested that it would be great if the editor could save custom duotones for future use.</p>

<p>WordPress 6.2 comes with a browse mode of the Site Editor. This includes a black left menu bar that blends in and out depending on if you are editing a template or browsing the menu. Until RC 2, &#8220;Navigation&#8221; was one of the menu items on the left admin menu, it was, however, pulled before this week&#8217;s RC 2. <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> summarized the discussion around this issue in their post: <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/14/fyi-navigation-section-of-new-site-editor-experienced-removed-for-6-2-rc-2/"><strong>FYI: Navigation section of new Site Editor experienced removed for 6.2 RC 2</strong></a> and shared also the list of issues this feature has.

<ul>
<li>Go global: change once, update to all places where patterns were added.</li>



<li>Pattern locking features</li>



<li>Light/dark version of the same pattern.</li>

<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Hello and welcome to our 80th episode of the Gutenberg Changelog Podcast. In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about WordPress 6.2 Preview, Gutenberg 15.2 and 15.3. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate and a full-time core contributor to the WordPress Open Source Project. I&#8217;m thrilled to have with me today Rich Tabor, product manager for the WordPress Open Source project and part of Automattic&#8217;s Five for the Future program. Hi, Rich, thank you so much for taking the time out of your very busy week to be here with us and talk to our listeners. How are you?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Hey, thanks, Birgit. I&#8217;m doing pretty well. I can&#8217;t complain, to be honest. Thanks for having me on this show. It&#8217;s been a long time coming here.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think so, for two years or so.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: In and out. For many who have known you in the community, you are an early adopter of the block editor, you and Jeffrey Carandang worked on several things together in the early days, and that&#8217;s about five years ago now. Since then, you presented at WordCamps, virtual and in-person. I remember your talk at WordCamp Atlanta. No, was it Atlanta in 2019?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yeah, it was.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; Boston &#8217;19 that I saw you, but both of them are fine. Also, your talk on WordCamp US in 2021 and last year, so there&#8217;s a lot you did in the last five years.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I&#8217;ve been exploring block editing since I guess before it landed in WordPress. WordCamp US in 2018, I believe, is really what kicked me into gear on designing and building block experiences for Gutenberg. Since then, I&#8217;ve been building, launching, and sharing my knowledge however I can. Code Blocks, the project I did with Jeffrey Carandang, it&#8217;s now under the GoDaddy brand, I was one of the early explorations and just a really great entry to learning the ins and outs of Gutenberg. I personally learn best by doing something real and releasing an open source block plugin for folks to actually use was certainly the catalyst to where I am today.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I used Code Blocks together with Atomic Blocks. Michael Allison was pretty much also on the forefront and it must have been before 2018, though, WordCamp US 2018, because I think wasn&#8217;t that there when you already sold Code Blocks to GoDaddy?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I think it was January 2018. In 2018, it was the like, &#8220;Hey, I need to get serious,&#8221; moment. Maybe it was &#8217;17, I don&#8217;t know, but right around there, it was like the, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s learn this and let&#8217;s do this.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Now, as a product builder, what do you find now fascinating about the WordPress, the block editor, the Site Editor, and this potential to empower folks?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I think that potential is huge. The WordPress experience is changing and evolving, and it&#8217;s slowly becoming more intuitive and better to use on the site level, not just on the post editor level. I just think that the opportunities for empowering those creatives and publishers and just people who want to share something and have a little ownership in it on the web is paramount to the future of the web, and I&#8217;m just so thankful to be a part of this time in WordPress.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s been quite exciting to see what people come up in their creativity, what they do with the sites, what they do with the design tools, how they manage the space and the spacings and the dimension controls. There are quite a few additional explorations there that are totally new to WordPress, nobody really, apart from additional third-party page builder, but to have that right into the software is such an amazing product. I&#8217;m really happy about that. I&#8217;m glad we are finally here.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: We&#8217;re getting there, yes.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We are there. To the Site Editor, do you think it&#8217;s ready to have people use it in production and all that?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Oh yeah, certainly. I think that there&#8217;s always improvements to be made and there&#8217;s still a lot of lines to draw between the dots to connect a lot of these experiences, but overall, as a holistic editing experience for your site, it&#8217;s really been fine-tuned in the last couple of maybe half a year or so, since the release of 6.1, it&#8217;s really tightened up quite a bit and there&#8217;s more to do, but I&#8217;m pretty stoked at where we&#8217;re headed.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Me too, me too. We will talk about it when we go to 15.3, I had another great experience with the new tools that are in there, but first of all, we have some announcements, well, actually one announcement, but it has multiple facets there.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>



<p>There is an official WordPress Developer Blog and in February, there were six new posts published there and one of them was a block theme resource roundup by Daisy Olsen. If you are WordPress developer, either you have already experience with block themes, you get some resources there, as well as if you just get started and want to have one page where you can have a startup page, so to speak, get started and get to the resources that are available on wordpress.org, all through learn, through the Developer Blog, through documentation, the theme handbook, it&#8217;s a great roundup of all those resources.</p>



<p>The next one is a little bit is a topic that is really high on our minds and finally, we have a post up there, and you probably can talk about that, as well, it&#8217;s about the intrinsic design theming and rethinking how to do design with WordPress. Justin Tadlock wrote this post because there were a lot of questions about the responsiveness of WordPress, that&#8217;s one thing. The other one is many people that come from other page builders, they miss their viewpoints, the three viewpoints that they have been using for the last 8 or 10 years. But intrinsic design is more the fluid typography, so no matter what the screen size is, it adapts to the screen size and there&#8217;s also fluid spacing that&#8217;s now part of WordPress. Is that enough, what do you think, Rich?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I think you hit it on pretty good. It&#8217;s the idea that when you design something in WordPress, in this case, that it inherits the responsive nature of the viewport, instead of you having to actually declare those values, like instead of declaring that you want to font size smaller on mobile or even a column going to Stack on mobile versus on desktop, maybe it&#8217;s side-by-side. It is something that intrinsically will Stack whenever it becomes too small to render side-by-side, so trying to figure out those controls, it is tricky to be honest, but there&#8217;s been a lot of improvements in that direction and overall, it does simplify the editing experience quite a bit. That doesn&#8217;t mean that we&#8217;re there, by any means, on the controls that we need, but if we do improve some of the Row and Stack capabilities and some of this intrinsic design methodology in WordPress, I think it will move forward to the point where it&#8217;s less of a concept that you have to think about and more of just a way that you expect it to work.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I can see that those viewpoints, that&#8217;s more for designers rather than your site owners or those who just want to build a website and hope that it&#8217;s all working out of the box, and those concepts can get really confusing, but also very hard to manage. I saw a plugin that was built on the block editor, but they had six viewpoints for every design decision. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s where we want to go as a product, pretty much, or for the normal user or even the design user, the theme developer, that they have to be so granular. It&#8217;s not so much thinking about the first version of it, but also where did I change this? Is it in the viewpoint of this one or this one or this one?</p>



<p>With the proliferation of the screen sizes, they go smaller, but they also get bigger, I think it&#8217;s going to be harder and harder to actually hit the right size for the viewpoints. I think there was a very interesting article from Justin Tadlock and there&#8217;s definitely a lot of discussion also on there, so dear listeners, you can definitely spend a half an hour or so reading that and also reading the discussions. Another article on the Developer Blog explains the difference between the static and dynamic blocks. Joni Halibi wrote this one. I know it was a topic close to her heart. She&#8217;s a developer at Georgetown University.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right, yes.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you. I heard her talking about it, so I asked her if she wanted to write about it. It&#8217;s definitely a great rundown of the pros and cons of static and dynamic blocks. Dynamic blocks are rendered with PHP, static blocks are everything the editor, as well as frontend is coming from Post Content from the JavaScript. I think the biggest hurdle is the updating during development and after development. I&#8217;m jumping over the other lists there.</p>



<p>There is just today, Michael Burridge published an article on how to deprecate static blocks and have some version, so you have a version of a block on the site and you use it multiple times and then a new update comes for the block. Sometimes when you open up the post into the editor and there was a block in there and it wasn&#8217;t deprecated right, it has this error message in there, so something happened with the block kind of thing, and some of you have already seen it, and this prevents that from happening. It&#8217;s not difficult from the mechanics, but it&#8217;s definitely something to think about when you do static block development. How did you feel about that when you came across it in your early days of block development?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I feel like that&#8217;s a pointed question. The idea between static and dynamic blocks is really powerful. Dynamic blocks are definitely, I would say, probably the primary use case on most of the more complex blocks that you would build, in particular in third-party situations like rebuilding a custom block for a client, because you don&#8217;t need deprecations at that point. If you need to make changes, you can, because it&#8217;s all rendered in PHP, and the tooling around dynamic blocks has improved quite a bit, as well, with the render.php file that you can load in and it makes templating a much easier process than it was originally. But deprecations are a necessary part of static blocks and they can be a little frustrating just because it sits there forever at that point, but if I&#8217;m building a custom block these days, I probably would lean more on the dynamic side, if possible.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I can see that. There are some new ideas actually happening that also will be on tap into the dynamic block development there, and we will talk about it on the Gutenberg Changelog when the time is right. Two more posts were launched just recently, one was how to create a custom block that stores Post Meta. That&#8217;s certainly a big question that a lot of people had and Ryan Welcher answers that question nicely, walk you through step-by-step, and explains very much most of the steps that are necessary to make that successful.</p>



<p>And then the other post is converting your short codes to blocks, and that one is from Jonathan Bossenger and he has his use case that he&#8230; It&#8217;s not really a conversion, it&#8217;s recreating something that was a short code into a block and make it more user-friendly. Short codes had their good usage, but with newer modern interfaces, they are just too cumbersome for site users to write all those text strings and not forgetting a comma or something like that, so converting them to blocks is definitely a good way to go about them. Any thoughts about those two problems? It doesn&#8217;t have to be from the articles.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I would say they&#8217;re both well-written and good examples of writing tutorials and documentation together, in a sense. There&#8217;s a short code that Jonathan&#8217;s actually converting in real time, you can see and watch it, I think you might be able to listen to part of it, but the idea that you&#8217;re taking a real-world example and converting it, I think is very powerful. And then the same goes for the other one about storing Post Meta with the custom block. I think it&#8217;s very powerful and hasn&#8217;t been done very often, or at least not often enough that&#8217;s front and center, because it really is a powerful way to manipulate Post Meta, but also site options. I think it works very similar if you&#8217;re updating the site options, which is what the site title block does and the Site Logo block. But you could do other options, perhaps, like I experimented with pulling in the WooCommerce phone number into a block, but if you update it there, it also updates it in WooCommerce, again, connecting some of those dots that right now are very disconnected and this is one of those steps in that direction.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, that&#8217;s actually a good idea to look beyond the WordPress core and see where connections and integrations are made. We definitely share the links in the show notes that are coming out with this episode or you can just go to the Developer Blog and read through the latest What&#8217;s new for developers? (March 2023). That&#8217;s the second edition of a roundup post of what&#8217;s new not only in a block in the block development, but also for core and the learn places, but it&#8217;s specifically for developers, extenders, plugin developers, theme developers, or agency developers so they can get up to speed very fast.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>



<p>We have, in the section of community contributions, there&#8217;s one new project, the theme team kicked off the community theme project, and I believe, Rich, you were part of it. What can you tell us about it?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yeah, certainly. On March 7th, we had, I think, over 20 people participating in the Hallway Hangout session to discuss it. This community theme project is an interesting way to start really just encouraging experienced and new WordPress contributors to create more themes, in particular, block themes. It was a big learning curve to how block themes are created compared to existing themes, but really they&#8217;re much more of a simple system that&#8217;s design-oriented, so some of the talks were centered around a designing a theme within the editor and not necessarily with a different design tool like Figma, which is a huge challenge, but I really think it will help open up a lot more eyes to the issues that we need to continue resolving within the editor to encourage more of the explorative design work that designers can leverage to build beautiful themes.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a Slack channel within Make, it&#8217;s the Core Themes Projects channel, there&#8217;s some discussion there. There&#8217;s a repo, I think it&#8217;s WordPress/community-themes. The idea is that you can start creating themes and submit them as a pull request and collectively, we&#8217;ll all try to help get these situated in the right way, so where we&#8217;re all learning and growing from this experience of building themes together.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m really excited about this. This started with the theme team, thinking about the latest default team that was 2023, where there was a call for sending in style variations. There was a base theme that was made public very early and then there were, I think, 19 theme designers sent in about 30, almost 40, style variations, of which 10 made it into the final release. But that kind of community collaboration is always very fruitful and very creative and it helps people really learn about things, but also push the boundaries so much more than just brooding alone in your own remote home office. I think that&#8217;s a fantastic way to get the community also in producing more than one theme per year; I hope that is what will come out of it. The theme will all be published under the username of WordPress, so that&#8217;s the new part of it, I would think. Do you already have an idea for a theme that you might want to work on?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I&#8217;ve got the bug to redesign my blog again. I love it, but I want to remove some of the barriers to publishing. Featured image, right now, it&#8217;s almost required in my current blog design, and then I want my headings to be a certain lead flow, so I want to try to identify the things that are blocking me from publishing more and start designing in that essence, so it could be more of a thought feed instead of only technical blog posts, in a sense. That&#8217;s my personal project I&#8217;ve been exploring a little bit on.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I saw that the list of block patterns for the Query Loop actually would probably help you with that, because there are quite a few text-based lists design available now in the Block Pattern Directory, as well as I think that are now coming out, as well.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yeah. There&#8217;s more opinionated design elements to some of these patterns, which I think is great because at the end of the day, if you don&#8217;t want to use a pattern, you don&#8217;t have to use it, but if you do want to use one of these more interesting, opinionated designs, then it&#8217;s a great start to building out the rest of your theme. I&#8217;m really looking forward to even more of the patterns coming down from WordPress.org.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Oh, speaking about switching the site up, Felix Arntz, who is a software engineer with Google, shared his experience on doing exactly that, switching his site from a classic theme to a block theme and his post is exactly that, rebuilding my website using block theme. It&#8217;s a very long post; he recounts all the steps in detail that it took him to convert it, and it wasn&#8217;t so much&#8230; It was minimal code editing, he says, in part, but he also had to update his custom blocks, so that&#8217;s part of it. But he also, and that was very interesting for me to read, is that Felix is also a member of the WordPress Performance Team, so what he did was also measuring the performance before and after the redesign and it really piqued my interest, and you definitely should read it, dear listeners. I&#8217;m only Miss Numbers on the podcast, it&#8217;s really hard, but I just wanted to say one number.</p>



<p>He did two steps. One was just recreating the same pages with the block theme, the header and content and Query Loop and that part and then measured it, and then he did additional tweaking and he actually explains very detailed how he did those. And then with the first step, just moving it over to a block theme, he had an improvement on the LCP, which is the longest content paint, one of the web vitals. He went from something a little over 1 second to 600 milliseconds, so that was an almost 38% improvement of the speed. But when he did the first performance tweaks, he went down to 452 from 1 second to 0.4 second, that&#8217;s an improvement of almost 60%. That was the first time that I actually saw this so very much spelled out and I have a trust in Felix that his numbers are actually averages from multiple tests, he explains that also in his post, but this was a very interesting post in many, many directions. Also, learning more how to do some more performance tweaks was one. I&#8217;ll leave the link in the show notes and definitely go and read it.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I would just like to echo what Felix writes at the very end. He says, &#8220;Block themes in full site editing, the effort for the Site Editor has evolved quite a bit since it originally launching in 5.9.&#8221; He says, &#8220;Here, I can with confidence say that it was the right decision for me to jump on that train now. If you&#8217;ve tried block themes a while ago and weren&#8217;t satisfied, maybe give it another try.&#8221; I totally agree with that sentiment. Especially if you have a personal blog, I would say just give it a shot, even 2023, put that on there and start designing it within the editor, then start running with it, you can see what happens.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: If you are not a developer and a little bit of hesitant to change something in production or on a live site, definitely be cautious. There is a new tutorial up and I just listened to it a couple days ago with Sarah Snow, she actually did the same thing. She went and replaced her old theme with a new theme and rebuilt her website, but she also walks through how she tried to avoid all the pitfalls to take her site down and all that, so that is also for non-developers, a very good tutorial to look at and to watch.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.2</strong></h3>



<p>That brings us to the section of what&#8217;s released? Of course, we start with this week, it was release week with multiple releases.</p>



<p>One of them was the 6.2 Release Candidate 1 and the contributor published 12 dev notes that are related to the block editor in the Field Guide. The Release Candidate 1 is that point in the release cycle where there is hard string freeze, the Field Guide is published, and the emails go out to plugin and theme developers about what&#8217;s new, that send the Field Guide and also to test their products against the new version so they can figure out all the incompatibilities or make it compatible to the version. The final release is on March 28th, 2023, that&#8217;s, right now, 18 days from today. We are recording this on March 10th. Rich, you were part of the release squad as lead for design, what was your role there, or is your role there, you are not done yet?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: No, not quite yet.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We are not done yet.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right. I think there&#8217;s three focuses, especially around this release. But the first, I would say it&#8217;s keeping a general pulse on what&#8217;s coming, what&#8217;s being worked on, keeping contributors focused on delivering that best, optimal WordPress experience that&#8217;s always right there on the horizon. It doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re there today, like I&#8217;ve said a couple times here, but if we set our gaze in that direction, I&#8217;m sure we will continue refining and iterating towards that best experience, so that&#8217;s the first. The second would be the about page. The WordPress about page introduces you to the latest and greatest parts of WordPress that have been put into by all these contributors over the last release.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s been a fun project working with designers from the design community and really putting together the images and the layout and the structure, even the copy, to make sure that it portrays 6.2 as intended. 6.2 has a lot of new stuff in it and it&#8217;s hard to distill that into one page, but it&#8217;s been a welcome challenge, for sure. And then the last bit, this release, we did a product demo of 6.2, I did it with Anne McCarthy, and that was a very nice way to really showcase what&#8217;s coming in a live action, here, this is like a real demo on a real site that I set up. I was using 2023 and I designed it a little bit differently so that it showcased some of the design tooling in the actual demo itself and it was great. We had lots of help, lots of folks really chimed in to make that what it was, and I thought it went pretty well.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The site was beautiful. If you, dear listeners, haven&#8217;t seen it yet, go, and of course there will be a link in the show notes, but go to the product demo and watch that video. You will learn a lot about 6.2, but also it&#8217;s actually a joy to watch, so that&#8217;s definitely….</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Awesome.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It shows that a designer was preparing for the product, absolutely. As mentioned, there are block editor related dev notes, so what&#8217;s coming, what should developers watch out for? We are not going through all 12 of them, but there, we have a few. First off is the introduction of the Block Inspector tabs, which is a design, an interface change, that your customers or you, if you build sites for others, will need to get used to, because now the settings are in two tabs, one is the settings tab, the other one is the appearance tab. In the developer note, we learn how a custom block can manage that for themselves, where do the settings go or the styles? I know that some custom blocks have their own color picker and if they don&#8217;t do anything, they will find it under settings and not under appearance, for instance, because settings is a default. There&#8217;s a little trick there that&#8217;s in the dev notes how to do that, there&#8217;s a new Group attribute that says either style or settings.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Next step, we have shadows that are added to global styles in 6.2. These are shadow presets that are provided within the core theme.json file, but themes can also provide their own shadow presets using, I think it&#8217;s settings, shadow preset. There are four or five provided by core, but they&#8217;re pretty easy to override. In the future, releases will include the shadow control elsewhere. Right now, it&#8217;s only on the button block and that&#8217;s to restart refining it and tightening up the experience first. Some other ideas that are circling are perhaps allowing multiple shadows, so how do you Stack them, perhaps? Of course, the blur, the X and the Y, trying to really hone in on the design of the shadows, as well, but right now, they&#8217;re just preset-based. I think they&#8217;re nice, but they do need a little bit more work before we move them available on more blocks.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You said that they are now only available for the button block, they are not available in the post editor, only in the Site Editor in the style sidebar, just because of that….</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; that you only can do global studies with that. The next one is the introduction of an HTML API, which is, it&#8217;s very developer-oriented, so it&#8217;s highly technical, but it&#8217;s a uniform way that WordPress developers now can travel through parsing a website and changing out tags. That was always prone to rejects and all the other things that was only prone to not always hit the mark and this one is now so much better. People can use it not only for the block editor, but of course, also for their PHP plugin or other apps that they add to the WordPress.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right. The next one here is the sticky position block support was added in 6.2. Right now, it&#8217;s featured on top-level Group blocks, so only the Group blocks that are within the top level of your document, so in the list view, it&#8217;s the first level. It&#8217;s this new prop that right now enables you to set it to sticky and if it&#8217;s set to sticky, even within the editor itself, the actual Group block will stick. Right now, it&#8217;s not open to other blocks because there&#8217;s still some UX considerations around sticky positioning, because it doesn&#8217;t always stick if the surrounding element isn&#8217;t tall enough to allow for sticking, so trying to figure a smart way to communicate that is a very important part of that experience, otherwise you would think it would stick, but it doesn&#8217;t. I think that that&#8217;s something significant to iron out, but that&#8217;s already in the works for, hopefully, the next release of WordPress.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: There&#8217;s a lot of trial and error to do and a lot of people have a different ideas on how is this supposed to work, but I am really looking forward to it. Well, the sticky header, we all know about, but with mobile, you also need to think about a sticky footer, because that&#8217;s where your thumb goes. When you look at a webpage, you are not going to the top, you are going to the bottom, so there are quite some new variations possible. The next one is that a lot of people waited for it and now, here it is, custom CSS in the global styles, that&#8217;s one part, but also you can have custom CSS4 on a block level, so it&#8217;s now here. It&#8217;s a little bit more hidden, so it&#8217;s also in the style sidebar, it&#8217;s not upfront in the left-side menu item like it was for the customizer, but it&#8217;s there and it works and it&#8217;s beautiful.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: A few people asked me if it would also come to the post editor so you can do it on a single instance of a block, because in the style sheet, you only do it for the block and then it propagates over the full site, but if you just want to do one section in your per&#8230; That&#8217;s not possible, unless you do an additional class name in the advanced section and then go to the standard sheet and put that class name and your styles in there. I have an answer for that person who had the question.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes. And then the next big one is the minimum height dimension support, and this is a new block support feature added to 6.2 for the Group and I believe the Post Content blocks and it&#8217;s opted in by default. This makes the Group and Post Content blocks perform much like the Cover block, where you can set a minimum height that it would take over in the page. It&#8217;s useful, for example, if you had a footer and some content and you wanted the content to keep the footer down below, so you can set a minimum height of the content using a viewport unit, perhaps, and then that would apply it to where the footer would stay towards the bottom of the page and not be meshed up at the top. It&#8217;s pretty self-explanatory and we already have this in the Cover block, but it starts to extend it out into other blocks.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wonderful. Excellent. Also, there is not a Card block per se, but there is a component there, but I think with the minimum height, you actually could use that Card block for all kinds of different content there. The Miscellaneous Editor changes in WordPress 6 is that that place where all the little things go in. There are a few little things that are not new features, but they are extending existing features. The first one is the fluid typography now also has a minimum font size in the UI that you can set, I think is it UI? Yeah, I think so. You could always do this for the theme. How you can use it, I read 13,000 words in three days or something like that, forgive me for that. That&#8217;s why in 6.1, there was a minimum, but there was a hard coded minimum and now it&#8217;s you can set this as a theme developer, as well, in the theme.json. Of course, it&#8217;s not in the UI yet, fluid topography is not that yet in the style things, I guess.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: For another Miscellaneous improvement, we have sizing controls for flex layout children. This means that when you have Container blocks, like the Group block and Row and Stack blocks, you can set a flex-type layout which provides controls for the blocks within those. If your blocks are stacked vertically, then it would be a height control, if they&#8217;re stacked horizontally, it&#8217;s a width control, so it&#8217;s dynamic in that sense. You can set, I believe it&#8217;s fit, fill, and fixed, so that&#8217;s where it either hugs the content, fills the available space, or is a fixed value. This plays into the intrinsic design that we were talking about earlier in starting to add more controls that allow a block to either try to take up only a space as it needs, fill up all the space that is available, or stay within constrained value, so it&#8217;s one of those improvements in that direction.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The next one is there is a new CSS class attributed to every Heading block, so now you can control the Heading block more granularly for each of the levels, and you can, for instance, say a blue background for all the H1s and a pink one for all the H2s, which is now easily done through the theme.json by adding the other style for the elements. You have style elements, each one, color, background, that would be the latter, and the other one would be styles for blocks and then Heading and then the elements, then each one, and the background, so it&#8217;s quite granular in the controls, that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yeah, I agree. I believe the last one for the Miscellaneous Editor improvements is the ability to edit block style variations from theme.json. This is a new theme.json API that allows existing core block style variations to be styled directly from theme.json. For example, the Image block has a rounded variation, so you could target the rounded variation and set its border width or border radius within theme.json now, which is pretty neat.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I believe then, was it in 15.3, we also get the UI for it in the style?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, we&#8217;ll come to that. But that is our WordPress 6.2 rundown on the developer notes. Of course, there&#8217;s more, look at the Field Guide, the links will be in the show notes, of course.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gutenberg 15.2 and 15.3</strong></h3>



<p>We&#8217;re coming to the last, to Gutenberg releases 15.2 and 15.3. Gutenberg 15.2 was released on February 23rd. Yes, it&#8217;s been that long that we heard each other, I know, and I&#8217;m really sorry about that. Daisy Olsen was release lead for that and it contained 197 PRs merged by 57 contributors, four of them were new. It was mostly fixing bug fixes, because WordPress 6.2 will contain all the features that came out in 14.2 to 15.1, that&#8217;s the whole range, 10 Gutenberg plugin releases, the features all come into core. But then after the beta release, there are a lot&nbsp; more people testing it, they find bugs, and they are still also finished the last little bit on some of the features, so many things in the Gutenberg 5.2 release or in the bug fix category. The new features probably didn&#8217;t make it into 6.2, but we can tackle each one of them and find out.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes, I&#8217;ll kick us off here. The first bit here is that there is a new nested level when selecting templates or template parts in the Site Editor, which is an enhancement that right now is a little bit it&#8217;s in a middle ground, where it&#8217;s basically a placeholder state for future contents to go. Some ideas are when you focus in on a template part, we could potentially have the different template parts that you could replace with that one, for example, or even some other different controls, like assigning it a category, having its name present, so it&#8217;s right now, a place to start thinking of what controls we can put there to control that template part.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The second part I want to point out is there&#8217;s now a modal to choose a start pattern for particular templates. The biggest problem users have is they want to start a new template, but how do they start? Now, theme developers and also plugin developers can actually add patterns to the site that now opens a modal and then can be selected. Also, the selection is a little bit better to view because you have more space to see all the patterns that are available for that. There is also an API in the works that lets you target certain templates with your patterns, but that has not been released yet, that&#8217;s still in the works.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: This next one here is pretty interesting, it&#8217;s the UI for template revisions. Now, we have a button to open up the revisions for templates and template parts, which is quite powerful because previously, it was very difficult or nearly impossible to find those revisions for your actual template parts. Say you&#8217;re focused in on your header and you changed some of your navigation items and then you changed maybe the background color of your header and then saved it all, but wanted to go back to a different version the next day or so, say it didn&#8217;t really sit well, you can now access those revisions and make those requests to change them back to what it was previously. I think it&#8217;s pretty neat on the template level and again on the template part.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Revisions, I always need to change my mind once back and forth, this revision is really helpful, having access to it to know what my former self was thinking with that and go back to a previous one. The next one with 15.2, it came a global save button to the Site Editor, so when you make changes to multiple templates and all that, it tracks them and then you can save all at once, but it&#8217;s not anymore to the right, it&#8217;s going to be on the left. I think it makes it, actually, in 6.2, you can have that, that was….</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yeah, I believe so. We have another one here for the Post Excerpt block that allows you to control the length of the excerpt. There&#8217;s a range control now where you could slide it left or right, or I think you could also enter an integer value, as well. It would essentially truncate to the Post Excerpt within the Query Loop block, so now you can define how long you want those to be instead of falling back on the default number of characters, which was pretty large, so it&#8217;s a nice quality of life improvement for designing.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m just hesitating and I need to verify this, there is the possibility that that was actually reversed in a later version.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I think the change, it was affecting if a post type didn&#8217;t support Post Excerpts. I don&#8217;t know that it actually reverted the control itself, but it is still a work in progress, that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t think it landed in 6.2.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No, it didn&#8217;t.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: It could be tidied up a little bit.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We definitely need to test this, as well, in a real-life situation.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Do you have a site that&#8217;s on Nightly or on trunk, where you have all the latest versions in production or so?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes. I&#8217;m running it dangerously, I&#8217;m running everything. The whole eat your own dog food stuff, I just really want to see the problems before they get big.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I changed over, I don&#8217;t know, a year ago for the Gutenberg Times to run on WordPress Nightly and also on the trunk version of the Gutenberg Nightly, which is a plugin coming every day from the current version.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: On the website, on the Gutenberg Times, you can see the Nightly, if you need to live on the edge.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The next item on the list is that the Post Featured Image block now has aspect ratio controls, so you can determine that and it makes your post table, the list of posts, much nicer to control that so when you have different sizes and images, you can actually say which aspect ratio you want to have in there. That&#8217;s a long-time want of mine to get that. There are themes who manage that quite well, but now you can do this, as well, in the block editor site templates thing.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes. There&#8217;s some more follow-ups on aspect ratio. I think it can be quite a powerful tool for not just a Post Featured Image block, but also just Image blocks or even Cover block maybe, I think there&#8217;s other ways to continue to push that forward, for sure.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I see from my agency days, which are not that long ago, see users adding featured images or even just images when they&#8217;re just changed the size of it and they didn&#8217;t change the aspect ratio with it, it was just very distorted. It&#8217;s very hard to teach that who is not dealing with it on a day-to-day basis and does not have an image dimension feel for it, it&#8217;s very hard to teach that, so if that works out as it should be in the editor, it makes for a much better web.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes, yes. I think that&#8217;s it for the highlights, for the enhancements. There was a whole slew of bugs that were fixed in 15.2, so I&#8217;ll call out this one here. The ToolsPanel needed a couple of tweaks, there&#8217;s a new feature in 6.2 for copy and pasting styles so you can design a heading or design a button, design anything, and copy its styling and then paste it onto another like block, so copy the heading styles to another heading or button to another button, for example. We needed a way to ensure that those values were properly propagated to these other blocks so there were some minor tweaks to fix that, but now, it&#8217;s all good and when you copy and paste those styles, you see those applied properly within the tools.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s such a phenomenal feature, that copy styles over, that you can have it. It&#8217;s in-between block-oriented or block on this post and global styles, it&#8217;s in-between, and sometimes you need that to make the same things look the same, but not the other things. It&#8217;s really good to just do copy paste on that. I think that was it for 15.2, unless I&#8217;m overlooking something. I&#8217;m scrolling, scrolling, scrolling. Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: This is a pretty big Changelog, yes.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I find one, though. You could use, so that&#8217;s for the build tools, the WP Scripts has now another flag that you can actually run it in development without having the watch from apply every build on your development system. I think that&#8217;s a good flag to point out for people who use those internal script for that. That&#8217;s the Gutenberg 15.2 for us. Let&#8217;s dive right in to 15.3. You&#8217;re coming right off of releasing it, Rich, so what was your first experience with&#8230; Was this your first experience releasing a Gutenberg plugin?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gutenberg 15.3</strong></h3>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes, it was, but I did co-release it with Hector, so he&#8217;s a team member of mine. He helped me, he guided me quite a bit on this one, but it was pretty smooth, to be honest, especially there&#8217;s a little bit of tension around getting the immediate bug fixes in for 6.2 and backporting and keeping that in line. But generally speaking, I think it&#8217;s a well-oiled machine and moving forward.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Definitely. It&#8217;s the 153rd release, so you hope that everything is well-oiled by then.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I like when you say backport and not only to 6.2, but also there are bug fixes for the release after the Release Candidate. There is an expression that I really like that&#8217;s cherry picking, which is an interesting thing to do.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But it&#8217;s just a little joke. People talk about it with cherry emojis. The release had 161 PRs in there, so almost as big as 15.2, and also a lot of bug fixes in there, but it also had some enhancements to the Duotone, quite a few. The Duotone CSS is now not created in line, that&#8217;s the expression, right?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes. It&#8217;s not applied in line.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: In line, it&#8217;s now in the style engine, so it can also be controlled through all the different levels. There is a control for the global size control for the Duotone and CSS variables instead of slugs, which helps it to propagate it over different to use the presets, as well, so Duotone is quite interesting. There is actually a bug in the backwards compatibility, it&#8217;s already noted that when you have a Cover block with Duotone and you upgrade it to 15.3, you get the heart attack kind of thing, oh, my Duotone is missing. If you apply them again on the same Cover block, it will appear again. That&#8217;s something that we found while we were testing it, but the bug fix is in the works.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Nice. It also means that by using these slugs instead of hardcoded hex values for colors, that when you do switch to variations, for example, those Duotones can actually map now to the new variations. If they use the same slugs, then you&#8217;ll get the new styles instead of in previous versions, where if you applied a Duotone reset from a theme, like say it was yellow and blue and then you switched to a variation or changed your theme up to one that was green, they would still be yellow and blue, so now it can receive the new ones if there are there. I think it&#8217;s a pretty cool improvement on something that is one of those things that should have always worked this way and now that we&#8217;ve explored a little bit more, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go ahead and knock that out,&#8221; so a lot of effort went into that.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The style versions are very, very interesting in that regard, that sometimes you want the thing to come over, take over your site, but then you want certain things that stay the same. It&#8217;s very hard to read the user&#8217;s mind as a developer, as a designer.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: The way I look at it is if you&#8217;re using a preset, then that&#8217;s game for a theme to manipulate. But if you&#8217;ve applied your own colors, I believe in these Duotone PRs, even if you applied a red and black, by picking the actual colors yourself, then those will stay hex value, so when you switch to a different theme, they&#8217;ll still remain red and black. But if it&#8217;s a preset, I would say that it&#8217;s open for interpretation by the theme designer.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think there is a bug in there. 15.3 also brings us a new block. It&#8217;s been a while since we had new blocks, but this one is a very tiny block, but it&#8217;s very powerful. People know that in a list view, you can see the number of blocks and the number of words and the time to read and several people asked, &#8220;Can we have that also show up as a block so we can add it to our post template or for the single post?&#8221; Yes, this was now implemented. It&#8217;s a very basic block, it only shows one minute or three minutes, well, 15 minutes, that&#8217;s all it does, but I really like that, because first, it can be translated in any language, and if you use it together with a Paragraph block in a Row, then you can have any string in front of it or after it that you as a site owner want to put in there. I tested that and it worked really nice.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I think there&#8217;s some follow-up PRs to do on that to add some of the design tooling that exists on other blocks, but it&#8217;s a great start and just nice, another piece of meta that can help readers know what to expect, investment-wise, like how much time am I going to invest on this? I think it&#8217;s great.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That was the one point where I really needed and was so happy that they have now, the custom CSS, because on the blog where I used it, I wanted to have that line reading time, one minute or three minute, be smaller than the rest of the excerpt in the post list. I was able to, of course, use the typography controls for the paragraph part, but not for the time to read, so I created, there is an advanced section where I can add a new class. I set a T2R and then went to the custom styles and then created the custom style for the T2R and made it font size small, which is pretty much the same as the reading time. It worked out of the box and with the rows, I could align it. The row controls were really nice, I like that. Now, I see that you could do some of the other shortcuts that are out there that are actually strings that are in a paragraph can now be blocks that need some design controls, but you don&#8217;t have to use the shortcuts anymore.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m thinking a little bit more in that direction.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I know that some of the developers actually were exploring having a token system to take care of those string-related in the middle of a paragraph kind of thing. I&#8217;m not sure if that is needed or just introduces another complication or complexity to the system and it&#8217;s hard for users to use. If you have a block meta for it, it&#8217;s so much easier to get it into the system.</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes, I agree. 15.3, I would say these are the big hitters on these, but there were a bunch of small improvements like making the Site Logo block placeholder just a little bit smaller so it fits better within headers, especially around the new header patterns included in 6.2. There&#8217;s been some quite a few bug fixes around template parts, resetting all for typography, making sure the Site Editor&#8217;s a little bit more tightened up, so some of the alignment parts and then the design units within the Site Editor have been tweaked and it looks and feels like it&#8217;s coming together quite well, but generally, I think those are the big hitters.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Let me go a little bit, I&#8217;m scrolling, scrolling, scrolling. Oh, what also happened, say, for some of the developers there wanted to know if there are new theme.json filters came into 6.1, but they were not yet in the documentation and they are now. There is a page in the how to guides of the Block Editor Handbook that is titled Curating the Editor Experience that has all the different ways how you can control or disable some of the features that are either in the sidebar available for your user or not or show up or are not. Now, you can also do this for the theme.json filters, they are now listed there. I believe one of the writers on the Developer Blog is actually looking at writing about them and having some good examples that are a little bit more closer to the real-life situations. I used the release candidate Changelog, but I think that was it, right, we all done?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yeah, I think so.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. That&#8217;s all we wanted you to know about 15.3, the rest you need to discover yourself. Of course, we have the What&#8217;s New in Gutenberg 15.3 post will be in the show notes. I don&#8217;t know if you published them yet or is it still in the works?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: It should be out soon, yes.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I wait for the episode to be published for that post, of course, so we can get it in there. Almost at the end of our Changelog episode, so what&#8217;s next for you in next week or next month?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: 6.2, the idea is that it sums up the culmination of Phase 2 and the kickoff of Phase 3. It doesn&#8217;t mean that there isn&#8217;t quite a bit more customization and design tooling that we need to continue to bake in, even like I was saying with the time to read block, as well, but that means that there&#8217;s now some more thinking going into what workflow-oriented processes look like for Phase 3, what type of collaboration can we start looking at. Making those plans and start writing about them and sharing ideas with everyone and really getting folks on focus and on point with Phase 3, I think is really important, so I&#8217;m going to start digging into that a little bit more, making sure the about page assets are tightened up and looking good for 6.2, and continuing to explore around designing block themes within the editor.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. I very much looking forward to the Phase 3 collaboration because it also will catapult your WordPress a little bit ahead of all of the other content management systems, because that&#8217;s what we are actually waiting for the last 25 years, is collaborating on our websites and not using all the other tools where you have to copy paste things over once you&#8217;re done with the collaboration. Now, you can do it all on the website, so I am really excited about that. Thank you so much for being on the show and walking us through all the great design and interface changes. When people want to reach you, where can they reach out?</p>



<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I write and share everything I know on my blog, richtabor, that&#8217;s T-A-B-O-R, .com. I am on Twitter, so Richard, R-I-C-H-A-R-D, _Tabor. I like to explore the fringes of WordPress and experience and try to push ideas around and see what resonates with folks, so feel free to chime in and ask questions or ping me anywhere.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: As always, the show notes will be published on the gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is the 80th episode. If you have questions, suggestions, or news you want us to talk about, send them to <a href="mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s <a href="mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. Thank you all for listening and thank you again, Rich, for spending time with me on this. Goodbye, everybody.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy, howdy! </p>



<p>This has been a busy week! Phew. The contributors published twelve Dev Notes related to the Block Editor together with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2023/03/wordpress-6-2-release-candidate-1/">Release candidate 1 version</a> of WordPress 6.2. The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/09/wordpress-6-2-field-guide/"><strong>Field Guide</strong></a> has all the developer related updates. It&#8217;s time for plugin and theme developers to test their products for compatibility with the new WordPress version. The final version is scheduled for March 28th, 2023. </p>



<p>The release squad for documentation, Milana Cap, Abha Thakor, Femy Praseet, and yours truly, wrangled the developer notes from two tracking systems, WordPress Trac and Gutenberg Repo. After the posts were drafted, we took turns reviewing them before publishing, all 13,150 words. </p>



<p>Then there were the posts for the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/news/">WordPress Developer Blog</a>, that needed editing and reviewing. That was lot of reading already, and then I kept an eye out for interesting content in the community to assemble this week&#8217;s round up post. The good news is, I am done for the week. 😎  🏖️</p>



<p>Enjoy and don&#8217;t take it in all at once. Keep some for later. </p>



<p>Yours, 💕<br><em>Birgit</em></p>

<p>On Friday, Rich Tabor, joined me on the Gutenberg Changelog episode #80 recording. We had great fun geeking out over the upcoming release of WordPress 6.2, Gutenberg 15.2 and 15.3. The recording will appear at your favorite podcast app over the weekend. </p>

<p>WordPress doesn&#8217;t have a Pattern manager/editor for site&#8217;s yet. The plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/blockmeister/">Block Pattern Builder by Block Meister</a> has been my go-to tool for a few years now. I also use the pattern builder of Newsletter Glue.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy, </p>



<p>Happy March! The last month of the first quarter is already upon us and Spring can come soon enough! </p>



<p>Last week I spent a considerable amount of time wrangling and reviewing developer notes for the upcoming <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/6.2/">WordPress 6.2 release</a>. The Release candidate 1 will be published on March 7th, and that&#8217;s also the published date for the Field Guide that accompanies each major WordPress release. </p>



<p>I have been very excited about the <strong>next all-women release squad</strong>, planned for 6.4, ever since Josepha Haden Chomphosy <a href="https://twitter.com/JosephaHaden/status/1620904918675767297">tweeted about it</a>. If you are interested in learning more about how WordPress releases work, watch the Make Core Blog for updates about the upcoming releases. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/">WordPress Roadmap page</a> was recently updated and shows that the 6.3 release is planned for August and 6.4 for November 2023.  </p>



<p>For myself, I will have a few distractions from my WordPress work and the Gutenberg Times the next two months. After almost a quarter of a century living in Florida, my husband and I are <strong>moving back to Germany; Munich</strong> to be more precise. It&#8217;s time to go home and spend more time with our families.  Both our employers, Automattic and Oracle, and our fellow teammates are supporting us generously and wholeheartedly in our change of residence. We are forever grateful. </p>



<p>I am eagerly awaiting to connect more with the German WordPress community, the communities in Africa and the rest of Europe. Speaking of which, <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/"><strong>WordCamp Europe</strong></a> is coming up in June (8-10). I already have my ticket. <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/tickets/">How about you?</a> I hope to see you in Athens. <a href="https://calendly.com/pauli-haack/wordcamp-europe">Use this link</a> if you want to put an in-person meeting in Athens on our schedules. The venue looks marvelous! </p>



<p>And now, without further ado, the news. </p>



<p>Be well! </p>



<p>Yours, 💕<br><em>Birgit</em></p>

<p>As mentioned, the WordPress 6.2 is coming together nicely. </p>



<p>Earlier this week, <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> and <strong>Rich Tabor</strong> provided a <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2023/03/03/6-2-live-product-demo/"><strong>Product Demo of WordPress 6.2.</strong></a> The recording is already available on WordPressTV.

The goal is to bring together a squad of people to build&nbsp;block&nbsp;themes all year around the same way the default themes are built.&#8221; Cabrera wrote. </p>

<p>In his post, <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2023/02/16/noodling-on-wordpress-in-2023/"><strong>Noodling on WordPress in 2023</strong></a>, <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/chriscoyier">Chris Coyier</a> </strong>wrote down his thoughts about WordPress. He took a broad look at the changes WordPress experienced in the last few years, the block editor for content, and in other contexts, and Block Themes. He wrote: &#8220;<em>WordPress needs to spend a year working on DX.&nbsp;</em>There needs to be a clear message about how people should be thinking about building themes and how to do so with productivity keeping extensibility in mind.&#8221; and then he continues: &#8220;maybe that’s exactly what they just did with Block Themes&#8221; &#8211; and calls it a component model. The four words in his posts were &#8220;PHP themes are dead. 🤷‍♀️&#8221;.  </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/retlehs">Ben Word</a></strong> wouldn&#8217;t have any of it, though. He posted a rebuttal: <a href="https://roots.io/php-themes-arent-dead/"><strong>PHP Themes Aren’t Dead</strong></a>. <strong>Ben Word</strong> is the part of the team around the Roots project. He makes a strong case for using and developing for the block editor.  &#8220;If you’re a modern PHP developer, you will have a worse experience developing FSE themes versus building a hybrid theme that uses both PHP along with the block editor.&#8221; Word wrote. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"/>



<p>And to stay within it for a moment, in his post <strong>Brian Coords</strong> is <a href="https://www.briancoords.com/embracing-theme-json-kicking-and-screaming/"><strong>embracing theme.json, kicking and screaming</strong></a>, and he has many questions. &#8220;Its still up to plugin developers to include their own styles for things, or use fancy tooling to try to pull from <code>theme.json</code> where appropriate- neither being an optimal solution. This also becomes a documentation problem.&#8221; He wrote and continues: &#8220;When you read any docs about <code>theme.json</code>, it’s usually in the context of full site editing, which means that almost all the documentation for it assumes you’re styling blocks and building a block theme. Even parsing what features work in block themes and which ones work in hybrid themes is difficult.&#8221; </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy, </p>



<p>WordCamp Asia was one of the best, if not the best flagship WordPress event.  I met quite a few subscribers to this newsletter in person. What a delight! I also made many new friends in the WordPress community.  Over the next week, I will add links to the live stream recordings and, if available, to the slidedecks to the post with <a href="https://gutenbergtimes.com/wordcamp-asia-2023-eight-gutenberg-related-talks/">the list of talks about the block editor</a>. </p>



<p>There are quite a few posts to be shared over the last 20 days since the last newsletter. It was great to catch-up. I kept my comments short. Many good things happening. </p>



<p>Wishing you a great weekend! </p>

<p>There have been many times when I wanted to have my build process compile my blocks, but also add something custom, for example registering a slot fill or a block variation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Configuring webpack can be difficult, but thankfully the WordPress scripts package makes customizing the build process pretty straightforward.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> add a <code>webpack.config.js</code> file into the root directory of our plugin.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> require the <code>defaultConfig</code> that comes with the package.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> require the <code>getWebpackEntryPoints</code> function. This ensures that the scripts package can detect and compile our blocks.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> In the <code>module.exports</code> object,
<ul>
<li>add the <code>defaultConfig</code> using the spread operator.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Add an <code>entry</code> object,&nbsp;</li>



<li>spread the results of <code>getWebpackEntryPoints</code>, and then&nbsp;</li>



<li>add any custom entry points as needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Code Example from the video </strong></p>



<p>Example that adds a <code>variation-icon.js</code> file to the build process.</p>

<p class="has-large-font-size"><strong>Transcript </strong></p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I know that people are coming in here already. We have a few participants here. Hi there, welcome to our 33rd Gutenberg Times Live Q&amp;A. My name is Birgit Pauli-Haack and I&#8217;m your host, curator of the Gutenberg Times and developer advocate for WordPress. It&#8217;s wonderful to have you all here. Happy New Year, welcome, and today&#8217;s show, we will discuss the opportunities and challenges of the layout features for site builders with the experts, the parents, so to speak, mom and dad of the layout features. And I&#8217;m extremely honored to have Isabel Brison, designer, developer, JavaScript engineer and core contributor on the show. Also Andrew Serong, also full-time developer, contributor to the Gutenberg Project, goes by the title Block Mechanic, and also sponsored by Automattic on the Open Source Project. And last but not least, Justin Tadlock, developer advocate, theme and plugin developer, member of the core team and former writer of the WP Tavern, now working for Automattic and prolific educator on the developer blog and Hallway Hangouts.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll do some proper introduction in just less than a minute. Just a few housekeeping notes. For those of you watching this on the YouTube livestream, use the chat box next to the video player to post your questions. And you can test it by letting us know where you&#8217;re watching from. The same goes for the Zoom place, but there are two places. One is the chat bubble for all your comments and your greetings and thoughts, and then the Q&amp;A section bubbles for your questions that we then answer in a bit. And please be kind, even if you disagree. This is a family-friendly endeavor. So, what&#8217;s the show about? Layout is a fundamental part of block themes. Layout features allow you to define the widths of your post content and the range blocks horizontally, vertically, right, left, and all sides in container blocks.</p>



<p>And in terms of block styling, layout is a complex feature because it affects child blocks in ways that go beyond the CSS, cascading style sheets inheritance. It&#8217;s probably part of the complexity that leaves some users a bit confused on how to deal with the various layout features and how to combine sections to a good page layout, and how this all fits into the block theme building process on template parts and the theme JSON. Before we answer your question, what is a container block, and more, allow me to introduce our expert. Then Isabel will give us a demonstration of the various layout features. And by that time, we probably have an array of questions that we can then tackle here as a panel. Isabel, you have been working for Gutenberg Project for a few years now. Lately, you worked together with Andrew on the layout features. What other parts of Gutenberg did you work on before that, and how long have you been at Automattic?</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, yeah. Before this, I think the major thing that I worked on before layouts was the navigation block. That was over a year ago now. And a feature that actually didn&#8217;t make it, which was a navigation screen that was meant to replace the classic menu screen. And yeah, that unfortunately got canned. And before that, we had this whole push to try and get bits of block editing in place for classic themes. We also did the Block Widgets Editor, that was another one I worked on. And yeah, I sort of float around and try to tackle accessibility issues when I have a bit of time between the major projects too. That&#8217;s sort of a passion of mine, and there&#8217;s a lot to do in that regard, always.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, always. Yeah, that&#8217;s true. Yeah. Well, where you&#8217;re located and what do you do when you&#8217;re not working?</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I am in Sydney, Australia. And oh, I don&#8217;t think I answered the bit of the question about how long I&#8217;ve been at Automattic. I&#8217;ve been at Automattic for, it&#8217;s going to be four years this year. I joined mid-2019. It has been a while, but it feels like it has gone really quickly.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, but in Gutenberg years, it&#8217;s kind of three quarters. No, 80% of the Gutenberg development time, you have been part of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, it feels weird to think I joined kind of at the start of the thing, when it was already in core, but it hadn&#8217;t been in core for very long and so I&#8217;ve seen it grow and yeah, it kind of feels like my baby now. Like, oh.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. What do you do for fun when you&#8217;re not working on a computer, or how you get away from the computer?</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, all sorts of things. I get away art, gardening. I like to go outside. No actually, you shut the computer down and go outside and get fresh air. I do a lot of gardening. I like growing herbs and veggies. I like going for walks, healthy stuff. And yeah, no, I do a bit of artwork on the side too, those, all sorts of things.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Yeah. Well, I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here. Andrew, what have you been working on in Gutenberg and before you worked on the layout features, and what made you select the title of Block Mechanic?</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Ah, that&#8217;s a good question. Yes, I think I started contributing to Gutenberg more actively surrounding how to interact with patterns and block patterns. That kind of quickly led on to contributing to design tools, because to have really great patterns, you need to have a lot of flexibility in design tools. And then I naively picked up what I thought was going to be a really easy issue to implement, of adding gaps between child blocks. And I thought, &#8220;Oh, that won&#8217;t take too long.&#8221; And like a lot of things, the first prototype only took a couple of weeks or whatever to put up, but then very quickly when you start digging into it, it then turns out there&#8217;s a whole load of complexity to wrangle, and that was both exciting and also a really big challenge. And so I figured, &#8220;Oh look, I&#8217;ll just put up my hand and give this a shot.&#8221;</p>



<p>And so then quickly found that there&#8217;s a difference between setting gaps on flex blocks versus things that have flown, and having vertical margins and things. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll get into that on the call, but it sort of led to picking the name Block Mechanic. My job title is officially JavaScript engineer, but engineering often sort of sounds a bit highfalutin or whatever, like you&#8217;re going to do big systems design and everything. But I think a lot of our job really is fixing the nuts and bolts and taking something apart and putting it back together. And so I don&#8217;t really consider myself an expert. I&#8217;m really more a generalist that is very keen to jump in and see if I can help move things forward. I kind of like a pragmatic title like that, personally.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent, yeah. And where are you located?</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: I&#8217;m also in Australia. Up until a couple of weeks ago, I lived in Melbourne, so Melbourne, Victoria, the second biggest city in Australia, but I just recently moved to the country about an hour and a half away. So, getting adjusted to a different quality of life, but it does make me very much appreciate working remotely because pretty much my whole life has changed, but work is exactly the same, which is really, really very nice.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, I appreciate that. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Justin, and you have been in the same space for almost as long as WordPress has been in existence. Recently, you switched from writing for WP Tavern to working for Automattic as a full-time contributor. And recently, you wrote a few tutorials on the official WordPress developer blog, and just today, we published your post about the layouts. Yeah, do you want to briefly talk about what you are doing and where you&#8217;re from and what you do?</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yes. I&#8217;m a developer advocate with Automattic since last May. Now, I don&#8217;t know how to define what I do sometimes. I kind of bounce around, but mostly my goal is to teach, to carry other people along this WordPress journey as best I can. And I&#8217;m glad we have the developer blog up and running, even though it&#8217;s still in beta. I&#8217;m hoping to be a big contributor there and write about layouts and everything else WordPress related. I&#8217;m from Alabama, in the United States, that&#8217;s the Southeast region. And I live not in the city, but a little bit outside of the capital of my state.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Are you going to Wordcamp in Birmingham?</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Somebody just asked me that today. Not as of right now, but I could be convinced to still go.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. Yeah. Yeah, let&#8217;s start at the beginning. I&#8217;m thrilled you all three all agreed to come here and be part of this Q&amp;A. I&#8217;m really sorry, listener and watchers or viewers, yes, I saw that the chat is disabled, but somehow I tried every little button there and I can&#8217;t enable it without probably going into the settings of the webinar and stop it. Yeah, feel free to just put your chat in the Q&amp;A and we kind of sort it out. Sorry about that. All right, so container blocks are group blocks to answer that question, column blocks, button blocks, social link blocks, cover block. Yeah. And now as promised, Isabel, are you ready to start us off with a demo?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;ll share my screen.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent, yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Share screens.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Share the screen and I&#8217;ll try to figure things out with the chat thing.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison:</em> Okay. Can you see my screen?</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: There should be a cat picture on it.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: There is. That&#8217;s a cute cat.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, okay, that&#8217;s the correct screen. Right, so layouts are a feature that came in with site editing pretty much because in classic themes, you used to just the theme also used to just figure out the layout themselves, writing CSS to space blocks and create columns and things like that. But with site editing, we have to provide mechanisms, that is the block editor has to provide mechanisms that allow people to do that layout work themselves. This is what the feature is meant to do and I&#8217;m going to showcase it. If you see my screen, I have actually the post editor open because all of these features that can be used in the site editor can also be used in the post editor. And if you&#8217;re showcasing single blocks, I feel like it&#8217;s easier to showcase them in the post editor because it&#8217;s a simpler interface.</p>



<p>Here we have a group block and you can see the outline here. This group, it has got a few blocks inside it. And if you go into the block settings, that&#8217;s actually not selected. So now I&#8217;ve selected my group block, and if you go into the sidebar where the block settings are, you&#8217;ll see that there is a tab called layout. And this has a bunch of controls. In the group block, you basically have two states where you can have the state. This most basic state of layout is it doesn&#8217;t do anything except provide a bit of spacing between each block. So, there&#8217;ll be a bit of a margin between each of the blocks inside the group. And then the further to that, the other, so it&#8217;s actually a different type of layout that you get when you toggle this toggle on is the same, a few spacing between the blocks, but you get content with two.</p>



<p>If your theme defines a content width, that content width will be applied and the blocks will go no further than that particular width. Here, this is the theme. The theme, this is 2023, I should have said, that I&#8217;m doing the demo on, and the content with &#8230; You can see it in the site editor, if you go into the styles tab and into layout. This is global styles and in layout, here we can see that the default content width for this theme is 650 pixels. That&#8217;s the width that these blocks should be respecting when that content width inside the layout is toggled on. But these, the sort of vanilla and the content width aren&#8217;t the only kinds of layout that we have. And the group block is pretty handy to showcase different types because it actually works with all different types of layout.</p>



<p>You might not realize that at first sight, but group block, roadblock and stack block are essentially all the same block. And you can actually toggle, so if you have a group in this up here at the top in the sidebar, you can actually toggle between the different types of block that group can be, so row, stack and group, and they all have slight differences. So group, as we&#8217;ve seen, deals with the content width, roadblock has a flex layout. And what this means is that all of the elements inside the block will be side by side as long as there&#8217;s space to contain them. You can actually force them to always be side by side even if there&#8217;s not a lot of space. So, you can get the blocks go really, really small and narrow, and all try to fit on the same line. And that is also a layout setting.</p>



<p>If we select the row here and we go and look at the layout tab once more in the sidebar, we&#8217;ll see that these controls are completely different from the group controls. And because it&#8217;s a flex block, we have a bunch of different options where we can justify here. You actually, let me close this. Okay, now we have a bit more space and we can see what these justification options do. With the row, you can justify all the content to the left or to the right or center, or you can add space between the blocks. And if you change the orientation, it becomes a stack block, essentially, because stack blocks are also flex layout blocks, but instead of being laid out horizontally, they&#8217;re laid out vertically. Now the only other control, going back to the row that I haven&#8217;t actually showed, is this toggle that tells you that you can wrap to multiple lines. And what happens if you toggle that on? Actually, do we have the row blocks selected? If we toggle that on, it should do something it&#8217;s not doing.</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: You might need some more content on that line.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s what I was thinking. Yes. If you have enough content or there is not enough space, that toggle will enable the content of that row to break into multiple lines, but you don&#8217;t have to do that. If the toggle is turned off by default, and that means that everything in that row is going to sit on the same line forever and there&#8217;s no changing that, even on a phone. Okay, but what can we do with these layouts? It&#8217;s all fine to look at blocks and add random content in them. Let&#8217;s go into the site editor and actually see, in terms of laying out your website, what are the practical effects of these controls? Okay, so here we have, here in the site editor, the list view is super handy for navigating because you tend to have a lot of wrappers. In order to create an elaborate layout, you almost always have to nest groups and rows and stacks inside each other.</p>



<p>And that means that the layout and selecting the blocks can get pretty complicated. So, I do recommend that you use the list view to navigate through all your blocks in the site editor. And it&#8217;s also the most accessible way of block navigation currently. Here we have a header, it has a group in a row, and you have the body which also is wrapped in a group. And actually, let&#8217;s go into the settings because we were in the global site tab. This group block that wraps the whole content has a content with the way layout. And let me just zoom out for a bit, and let&#8217;s make this small so that we actually see, so now this is tiny and you can actually see that there&#8217;s this block of, this is the group block and all its contents is sitting sort of inside in the middle, and it&#8217;s respecting that content width. And what I want to do, maybe I should zoom back in a little bit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I wanted to show these justification controls that you can see when you have this group layout and you can choose to justify. By default, your quantity is going to be centered if it has a content width, but using these controls you can push it right to the right or to the left. And what that does is just reposition the whole block of content to one side or the other. And that&#8217;s kind of different from the similar controls that we have in the flex layout because this just repositions the whole block. It&#8217;s not looking at individual child items inside it. And it definitely is not justifying your text, in case you might wonder. If you have a block of content that has text in it and you decide to justify it right or left with these controls, your text is going to stay in exactly the same place, as you can see here. It&#8217;s only the block that&#8217;s going to be moved, the whole block of content.</p>



<p>Okay, what else can we look at here in the header? Let&#8217;s go in and see some flex blocks in action. In the header, we have a group that is basically the only thing that this group is doing here is allowing the content width to be defined on its children. In this case, it has a single child, which is a row block. And the row block, what it&#8217;s doing is positioning. It&#8217;s allowing us to position the site title and the navigation on opposite sides of the block. So what we have in the row, we have a space between justification selected. That&#8217;s what it does. It just pushes all the elements inside the row in a way that they will have exactly the same space between them. So, we can see if we add another block in here inside our row, I&#8217;m going to add a site logo because that&#8217;s something that you might also want in the header.</p>



<p>And I&#8217;m actually going to push it, these text buttons, so the horizontal move aren&#8217;t doing too well. We need to fix that. Okay, now I&#8217;ve pushed the site logo to the far left, and now I have the site title sort of in the middle and the navigation at the end. But what I really want is for the site logo and the title to be side by side. Now we actually, as of last month, in the plugin, we have a way to do that. And so what we added was the ability to manipulate the size of the children of flex containers. In this case, the row is our flex container and the site title is a direct child of that container. And so in the site title settings, I hope this is not too small to see. If you go in here under dimensions, you have a width control, which may or may not be visible.</p>



<p>You might have to go into the dimensions menu and actually select it if it&#8217;s not visible. And this width control, I&#8217;ll zoom back in because this is practically invisible. This width control has three options. Fit is the default, it basically does nothing. But if you select fill, then that block is now going to occupy the maximum space it can in its container. And as you might see, that has in fact pushed the site title to sit next to the logo because now it takes up all the remaining space. So, you have that nice space between site title and logo and navigation, which is what we wanted. There&#8217;s also another option in here that you can play with is the fixed width, which allows you to set a fixed width. I don&#8217;t know, I could go 800 pixels, and suddenly this is really big and it doesn&#8217;t fit in a single line, but we don&#8217;t want to do that, do we?</p>



<p>Okay, what else do we have? Oh, there&#8217;s a really, really exciting feature that has just, just been merged. I don&#8217;t think I mentioned this, but what you&#8217;re seeing now, this demo, is the latest Trunk. If you go into the Gutenberg repo and check out Trunk and build a local development environment, this is what you&#8217;re going to see. And only yesterday, a very exciting piece of work was merged that allows us to position blocks. And currently, the only way that we can position them is sticky. But that is actually super useful if you want to create a sticky header. And I&#8217;m going to show how you can do it.</p>



<p>Now, due to the way that sticky position works in CSS, we have to make sure that the element that we want to make sticky is inside a container that&#8217;s scrollable. And because of how our template parts work, you&#8217;re not really able to add stars to template parts themselves. If we want to make our header sticky, we actually have to wrap it in a group block. Fortunately, that&#8217;s pretty easy to do because in the header controls, you can just click group and that will wrap our header in a group block, as you can see. And now with the group block, if we scroll straight down &#8230; Oh, wait a minute, I don&#8217;t see the position. Let me reload my site. Is it possible that I&#8217;m not on the latest version of Trunk?</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Quite possibly. It was just merged yesterday.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Quite possibly. Yes, it was just merged yesterday, but I was pretty sure that I had built it and I was on the latest version of Trunk, but oops. Oops. Where has my demo gone? Yes. Okay, let&#8217;s check that again. I&#8217;ve just reloaded, I need to redo the header. Come on, group and position. Indeed, I had not reloaded the page since I rebuilt Trunk.</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: There it is, saved.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Okay, now the position control has a dropdown, which currently only allows us to select one option apart from default. And that option is sticky. If we select sticky, hopefully now we scroll and as we are scrolling, we see that that header is sticking to the top. Now, this is not super visible because the header&#8217;s background is actually transparent. So, this feels a bit confusing. Let&#8217;s add a bit of background. Let&#8217;s say let&#8217;s just add a little gray background color, and now we can see. Now, that&#8217;s a lot more visible.</p>



<p>Okay, this is the new thing that we can do, which is super exciting. Of course, we can position any kind of block, but currently the control only works with group blocks, or groups, rows or stacks, which are essentially all a group block. And we have enabled that in the group block because it&#8217;s a new feature. To start with, this is the most obvious block to do it in. That doesn&#8217;t mean that it might not later be applied to other types of blocks, so that depends on the usage, that depends on the feedback that comes in. It depends on a lot of basically, how are people going to use it? How useful is it going to be? I think it&#8217;s going to be pretty useful.</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Yeah, me too. Probably an interesting thing to mention about position support as well was that when we started working on it, we were thinking of it as just another part of layout. Because we&#8217;re laying out a website, you kind of think, &#8220;Oh, these are all layout tools.&#8221; But through the discussion, we determined that one of the unique things about layout is that it applies to container blocks, so a block that can contain other blocks. And so a lot of the controls are surrounding how do you arrange children of a container? Whereas with position, within, I think one of the designers mentioned, wouldn&#8217;t it be cool to be able to move an image block, like just have it moved to the left slightly or have some sort of asymmetrical layouts? And so that then made us think, &#8220;Oh, well maybe position is actually its own block support, so it has its own panel.&#8221; And so we borrowed a lot of the code from layout and it sort of sits adjacent to the layout. It&#8217;s technically separate from the layout block support, but it still shares a lot of the same code.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. Yeah, that is true. I think we&#8217;re pretty much done. I just wanted to show another thing, another little gotcha. Particularly with the recent ability of adding spacing or adding sizing to child blocks of flex, so we saw that in row, in a row block, if you want to create spacing between, if you want to push a block to one place &#8230; Say if I want this block to be next to the first one, and if I want there to be more space here, then I can go in into the dimensions and fiddle with the width of that block. But in stack, which is the vertical equivalent of the flex layout, that won&#8217;t actually work because stack has as its height, it always takes up the content height. Again, this is a reflection of how height works in CSS, whereas usually the maximum width of something is the width of the screen, the height is the height of the content.</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s something that can actually be pretty confusing, especially if you don&#8217;t know CSS. In the stack block, you couldn&#8217;t just go in and select this block in the middle and give it, if you make it fill the available space. Well, the available space is just the space that those blocks occupy, so you can&#8217;t actually push it down. I guess you could give it a fixed height and then that would work. But if you wanted it to just fill the remaining space, your container block would need to have a fixed height. And now, we have that possibility because we can add to container blocks under dimensions, we can add a minimum height to them. And so I could say I want this whole stack block to be 900 pixels, and now I have a bit of extra space and I can choose to maybe make or maybe create a space between the first paragraph of text and the photograph, for instance.</p>



<p>We can play around a bit more, but remember that for stack blocks, if we want to have a bit of extra space in them, then we actually have to give them a defined height. And that is pretty much everything that I wanted to show. So, questions?</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right, well, wonderful. The privilege of a panelist is that you can have the first questions to demos. So Andrew or Justin, you have a comment or a note or a question for Isabel, go right ahead before we take the audience questions.</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, actually, are we going to see grid layouts at some point, like we have with flex?</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: That is a great question. Yes, definitely. And that is something that I would very much like to see done, and will probably be working on sometime this year. Grid is interesting. It is super useful because although pretty much at the moment we are using flex to create two dimensional layouts, and that&#8217;s not quite the right way to use flex. In my mind, flex should be used more for the detail, for small elements and not for whole layouts, because it becomes quite difficult to manipulate it with precision in larger, full-page layouts. And that&#8217;s why we see bits, you have flex in your header, you might not have &#8230; You won&#8217;t have the whole page wrapped in a flex block, but grid is super useful for creating full page layout. The difficulty with grid, the challenge is going to be because grid in CSS, the CSS grid spec is super complex, and there&#8217;s millions of things that you can do with it. So how can this be best translated into a UI?</p>



<p>And that&#8217;s, I think, and that is one of the biggest challenges in creating design tools for Gutenberg, is exactly that problem of translation of essentially the underlying implementation is CSS, and what is the most useful, what are the most useful controls that we can provide that reflect the abilities and the plasticity of CSS but are a usable and are intuitive to understand? You don&#8217;t want to just grab the whole CSS spec and translate it into UI, because that would be chaos. I mean it would be fun and interesting, but it probably wouldn&#8217;t be very usable. So yeah, that&#8217;s going to be a very interesting challenge to tackle in the coming year.</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, I figured I&#8217;d just throw the hardest question out to start with.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, let me go through the questions and Glenn Martin has been waiting for quite a while to answer his question, and it&#8217;s hopefully an easy one to answer. &#8220;In the site editor, is there a way to create a menu with the images instead of text?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: With images, a menu? Oh, I see. Oh that, interesting. I think, am I still screen sharing? I&#8217;m still screen sharing.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, you&#8217;re screen sharing.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Let me try something.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: On the fly.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: In the navigation block we have links. I&#8217;m assuming that what you want to do is to, instead of having the text, have an image link. Because this is rich text, we should be able to add inline images. If I want to add…</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: As an aside, I love your image gallery. More cats.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: More cats, yeah.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, technically you could do that. This is a page list. With the page list, actually, it just gives you a list of all the pages that you have. You can tell this is a test site because the only page I have is a sample page, but we can actually make the page list editable, and that converts it into a bunch of links. And so technically, because this is now a link, we could actually go and do the same and add an inline image. Now, no guarantees how accessible this is going to be because the inline image is fairly limited. You would be able to add a label, a description title.</p>



<p>Yeah, if I were to do this, I would give it a run through a screen reader just to double-check that your text content in the links is actually being read at, and do add text content because otherwise, screen reader user goes in there and clicks on the image or focuses on the image. And the only thing that&#8217;s read out is the image, either the file name or the URL. So, that will be very confusing. But yeah, I mean technically it is possible to do that now.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, that&#8217;s interesting. I have found that the inline menu, even for the paragraph, has a lot of great surprises for me. I was interested to see the inline image available for the block. Now Dana Rogers has this question, so group is just an understanding. &#8220;Group is a block element in row and stack are flex elements?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Mm-hmm. Yeah, essentially. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That was an easy question then.</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, I was going to say the group block uses the default flow layout of the web, if you want to describe it like that.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah. Yeah, I was taking block to mean as in display block, which yes, that&#8217;s correct. The group displays is block. But yeah, it is a flow layout. It&#8217;s as close to vanilla HTML as you can get in its default state.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah and &#8230; Go ahead.</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: I was just going to say the one thing that&#8217;s in addition to vanilla HTML is that it sets a margin top on everything except for the first child. And that&#8217;s how the gap is controlled between the spacing of each element within that group block. So, it&#8217;s a little bit opinionated.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay, yeah. Peter Goodsword, I hope I didn&#8217;t butcher too much your last name, &#8220;Is this a preview version? I don&#8217;t have a header in my list view, neither do I see settings, styles or options in my top right bar, even though everything is selected in my preferences.&#8221; There might be. Did you enable, Isabel, some experiments on that?</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison:</em> I have a setting enabled, which has actually been in there for quite a while. If you go to the top right button and you get a menu and way down, you click preferences, you have this toggle which says show button text labels. The default state of the site editor, you have icons for all the buttons.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, no. I think the question was more about in the list view, you have a header item. Yeah. And that should be actually in WordPress, or is that recently in the &#8230; I&#8217;m not quite sure if you don&#8217;t have it. Yeah, this is definitely in the Gutenberg plugin, Peter.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I think so.</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: My main question would be, are they in the site editor instead of the post editor?</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, this. Oh.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That could be, yeah. Yeah. There is the list view.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I mean in here, we do have list view in the post editor. And we do have-</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But not the header section?</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Well, there&#8217;s list view and outline. I mean, what do we mean by header section?</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The header, the header template part that you see, the list view. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, the header template part. Yeah. Oh yeah, no. Template parts. I think template parts are specific to the site editor. Let me see. Can I actually…</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s to the site editor. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It&#8217;s not. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: No, no, you can&#8217;t actually add a template part in the post editor.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Peter, does it make sense to you that it&#8217;s the difference between being in the post editor and site editor to what you see in the list here? Okay, so yeah, that answers that question. Thank you, Peter. It&#8217;s always important to figure out which, yeah, editor we&#8217;re actually looking at. Now M has a question. &#8220;How can you make a header sticky but not take up the entire screen when zoomed in?&#8221; I&#8217;m not quite sure I understand that. Maybe Isabel and Andrew or Justin understand it?</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: You mean…</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: I&#8217;ll let you go.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Not take up as in if we zoom in. Okay, if we zoom in past some point. Okay. Yeah. How not to have this happen if you have a big header and you&#8217;ll zoom way in? We do not have a…</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: If you had a fixed dimension of 900 pixels, how would that work on mobile?</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: One of the things that might be useful is when you&#8217;re adjusting settings, if you&#8217;re using minimum height or something like that, when you&#8217;re selecting the unit, you can switch to using viewport relative units. There&#8217;s a VH option. You can set something to be proportional to the height of the viewport. If you&#8217;re setting the height of your header area, that&#8217;s one way to do it. But another thing is if you&#8217;re setting an element to be sticky, it is kind of being mindful of how many blocks you&#8217;re putting into it. When Isabel was zooming in just then, you could see that in the navigation block, it was switching over to using the hamburger menu. That&#8217;s kind of nice so that way, when it goes to those small viewports, it shrinks like that. But at the moment in the initial implementation, we don&#8217;t really have any settings that are doing things differently in desktop versus mobile, or based on the screen width. It&#8217;s sort of up to how much content you are putting into your header to make sure that it plays nicely at different viewport sizes, I think.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. There were a few more questions. Darren Davis has the question, &#8220;Can you have more than one sticky position group on a page?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Yes, you can. Interestingly, because we chose to go with sticky first as opposed to fixed, what sticky does is on the block that you&#8217;ve put, you&#8217;ve set it to be sticky, it will then scroll to the next container up, so just its direct parent. In Isabel&#8217;s example, it&#8217;s at the very root of the document where we&#8217;ve set sticky, so that&#8217;s the entire page. But if you were to go a little bit further within your nesting and set it into quite a nested group area, it would only stick to that particular area that you&#8217;re scrolling past, and it would then scroll off the page. It means that you can have as many sticky elements as you want. Probably a good example would be some websites that might have a glossary that have the alphabet, and as you scroll past each letter, then that letter sticks to the top of the screen before it then scrolls off the page.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, that&#8217;s pretty cool. Yeah, you can do all kinds of little things. Yeah, yeah, excellent.</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: But also, it&#8217;s a new feature. One of the things we&#8217;ll be keen to see with feedback, like when we&#8217;re developing things, I think one of the challenges working in Gutenberg is trying to &#8230; The initial issue might be this really great idea, really fleshed out and then we go, &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the smallest version of that we can implement and code and get it into the plugin and then get some feedback and see what people can build with it?&#8221; If you are playing with it and have some ideas, feel free to open up GitHub issues and discuss what do you think we should do next.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And from YouTube we have a question about are you working on &#8230; Oh, we already answered that. &#8220;What happens to my custom additional CSS if moving to the new WordPress block themes?&#8221; And she was just getting used to the recent customizer things.</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, there&#8217;s actually a ticket. There&#8217;s some of the feedback I left as that we need to &#8230; The additional custom CSS needs to be ported over no matter where you originally set it in the customizer or in the global style section. Yeah, I don&#8217;t think it works like that yet, but I&#8217;m pushing for it. I hope. Yeah, we don&#8217;t want to lose that.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, good, good. That answers the question there. And then I think Don Fisher has the next question and it&#8217;s, &#8220;Will there be any breakpoint-specific layout adjustments coming for any of the blocks?&#8221; I think that goes back to that question about intrinsic design versus media query-based design. Andrew, is that a question for you?</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Oh yeah, I&#8217;m happy to talk about it. Yeah, there has been a lot of discussion across a number of different issues about people wanting to put in breakpoints and have that level of control, &#8217;cause they see it in a lot of page builders. But I think probably one of the areas of caution in Gutenberg is that once things wind up in core, we then have to support it in perpetuity. And it&#8217;s very easy for managing breakpoints to become really complex and not quite work properly in patterns. Let&#8217;s say we had something that was having a different layout on mobile versus desktop, but then you put that pattern into a really nested area and then it doesn&#8217;t quite work properly. The idea with intrinsic design is instead of using breakpoints, if we can use viewport-relative units or if we can use calculations or things like that. The recent fluid typography is probably a good example of a feature that doesn&#8217;t use breakpoints, but is kind of relative to the viewport.</p>



<p>And I think probably, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m not a designer, I sort of focus on what are the areas of consensus that we currently have in the GitHub repo, and how can we build to those things while giving designers a little bit more room to explore all the options before we try and commit that in code?</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. Yeah, thank you. M has another question. &#8220;For any image icon in the nav menu, do you ensure that there&#8217;s alt text?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: As in what I was showing earlier?</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All text as in your image context.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, your inline images, and please, someone correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, which I don&#8217;t believe that we have a way of adding alt text to inline images. And this is why I was saying, I mean technically it&#8217;s possible to create a navigation with just images, but I would run that through a screen reader first to ensure it&#8217;s accessible because I&#8217;m not 100% sure. If you add a link title, I&#8217;m guessing that that would be the best option to add meaningful text to the image as a link. But yeah, I would definitely double-check that and make sure it&#8217;s accessible because it&#8217;s not guaranteed. I mean, it wasn&#8217;t meant to be used in this way. So, I guess that what I was showcasing is more of a hack because the inline images are more &#8230; The main use case for inline images would be if you wanted to add an icon at the beginning of the text. It wouldn&#8217;t be to replace the text with an image.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That is something that we could look into doing. It would be an interesting experiment, to enable a way of creating a navigation with images that was fully accessible. But I think we would need to do a bit of work on that to make sure it is fully accessible.</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: I will just say when you&#8217;re actually in the media library, you can add the alt text in the modal overlay that&#8217;s popped up, and it will get inserted into the block editor.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Oh, if you add the alt text in the media library, you can actually have it pop up in the inline image?</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, yeah. I was just running a test on it real quick.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Nice, okay, then that works, yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: On image, yeah, nice. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Thank you.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Corner Shop Creative person has a question or two, actually. The first one is, &#8220;Will negative margins be added to Gutenberg? Right now, you don&#8217;t have the ability to add a negative margin to any element, but they are highly useful for achieving some layouts.&#8221; You chuckled there, Andrew.</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: That&#8217;s a really good question. I think that I&#8217;ve seen a couple of PRs that have attempted to implement it before, and I think the main issue is that it then makes it really hard to select the blocks in the block editor. It&#8217;d be very easy to accidentally slip a block underneath another block and then be unable to select it. I think it&#8217;s absolutely a great feature, but I don&#8217;t think the UI part of it has been figured out to how do you do that without losing the blocks altogether?</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, list view comes really handy in that one. Yeah. And then the second question was, &#8220;Will absolute or relative positioning ever come to Gutenberg?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Yes, that&#8217;s the hope. One of the reasons why sticky position took quite a while to figure out, the issue for it I think was open in 2021, and there were a few different experiments last year, was really figuring out the direction with designers to make sure that the way we&#8217;ve set it up allows us to explore future experiments where we might set a block to relative, and then a block beneath it to absolute, and then be able to move things around in an intuitive way. I think it&#8217;d be a really fun area to experiment with. And we&#8217;ve got sort of the initial foundation in place, so we can probably start doing some experiments this year and see if it&#8217;s one of those easy things or if it&#8217;s one of those gigantic rabbit hole, takes a long time things, which I suspect it might be.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Does it answer your question? Corner Shop Creative? Yes. Good, good, good. And then Stefan Mandel has a question and he writes, &#8220;The header and footer are also a kind of container block, so shouldn&#8217;t they have most of the controls of the group block? Is it kind of unintuitive to have that you first have to put the header within a group and then get the sticky functionality?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s one of the things we were discussing before we landed on that initial approach. One of the challenges, that the way that template parts work in the site editor is that they&#8217;re kind of a placeholder for another chunk of post content, of a bunch of blocks. And because it&#8217;s that sort of placeholder, there&#8217;s currently no ability to add styling directly to it. There&#8217;s a few technical reasons why that&#8217;s the case. The interventions we need to work out are how do we get the document to control how position works and then make it intuitive in the UI. I think sticky will probably always still need to be set either on the direct parent or the direct child, that it&#8217;s probably a UI problem to solve as to how to make that intuitive.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. There were a few questions in the chat that didn&#8217;t come over to the Q&amp;A. One was, &#8220;Will we in the future way to edit the names of the items in the list view?&#8221; There was a PR, but I don&#8217;t think it got merged or had any additional work on. So, we don&#8217;t know. And thank you for Corners Shop Creative to answer that question in the chat. And then the other question was just by Dale again, &#8220;Do all the settings in Gutenberg eventually resolve to CSS?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Oh, that&#8217;s an interesting one.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I mean, in all the design settings, all the settings that allow you to manipulate the appearance of your content do eventually resolve to CSS because that&#8217;s the language of visual presentation in web browsers. So yes, I think. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Probably one of the interesting things is where we have a one-to-one relationship between setting and CSS, and where we sort of deviate a bit. Things like marginal padding, the direct to CSS properties of margin and padding are applied, but something like block gap or block spacing, that&#8217;s sort of a concept in WordPress land. And then depending on the layout type, we then interpret that as that&#8217;s either a margin top, or if it&#8217;s a flex block, then that&#8217;s CSS gap.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Is it possible that we ran out of questions? Max Zeable on YouTube has a comment that, &#8220;That is an interesting point, meaning the intrinsic design approach, this should be communicated much more specifically to the page builder people,&#8221; because, so that he wrote, and I totally agree with him. There is not a whole lot of information out there, and I know there is a post in the works about that, but we definitely can use any additional help with that. The, I think, intrinsic design was only come out 2019 or something like that.</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Yeah, it seems to be quite a recent trend. And I think with a lot of the new newer CSS functions like minmax and calc and things like that, and also the promise of container queries and that sort of thing. But yeah, I think there is a fairly old issue, I&#8217;m not sure where it is right now, maybe someone can find it on discussing intrinsic web design with a bunch of the designers. For anyone interested in that, it might be useful to have a dive in to the Gutenberg repo and join the discussion.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m going to share it in the chat window. Hang on.</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Sure.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think that&#8217;s the issue. It&#8217;s called Responsive Blocks Versus Intrinsic Web Design. It seems to be in the title there. And I also saw recently a YouTube video where the person says, &#8220;Okay, it&#8217;s the browser and the media queries can&#8217;t actually cover all the different sizes anymore because there&#8217;s so many different sizes on devices that you always hit the wrong parts.&#8221; So, you could end up with not three viewports, but with 12. And I saw a plugin actually that had six different viewports for which you can create different designs. And I think that is a little bit too much cognitive load for my brain to tackle when I want to build a website. Some people can probably do that, but it&#8217;s definitely not for a user who wants to just publish content and do that. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: And it&#8217;s probably a good point that part of the beauty of plugins is that they can really go in some sort of wild directions and try that out in a way that we probably wouldn&#8217;t really want to do in core.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah.</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: I would say as a designer, it takes a little bit of getting used to, but I&#8217;ve kind of embraced intrinsic design over the last couple of years. I can&#8217;t remember the last time I&#8217;ve written a media query. Even outside of block-themed development, I want to use fluid values for font sizes, spacing, everything. I think it simplifies how we build for the web. And I also think most of our users, everyday users are going to be on mobile devices. So these really complex layouts where we have horizontal layouts and things are not how most people view the web. It&#8217;s mostly just top-down. And so I think intrinsic design is going to be the direction that&#8217;s best. It takes a little change of mindset and just if you haven&#8217;t moved beyond media queries, definitely try it out.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: One of the useful things, one of &#8230; Sorry.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Sorry.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: I was going to say one of the useful tools for that is CSS Grid because it has a bunch of auto placement features that will just resize and reflow the content depending on the screen size. And it&#8217;s great but yes, I agree with Justin, it does require a change of mindset because essentially what you&#8217;re doing is giving up control. You don&#8217;t get to decide whether your layout has two columns or three. It will be decided based on the size of the content and the size of the screen.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I can see that media queries are important when you want to hide content. Yeah, that&#8217;s not just stacking, but then you say, okay, if it&#8217;s just on mobile, I don&#8217;t want to have these additional columns just go on the bottom of it. I just want to hide them. And I think that functionality is more with the visibility, comes with the visibility of blocks and in core there is no feature right now for controlling visibility of blocks. I think there&#8217;s a great plugin out there that covers quite a bit of the visibility ideas, but it&#8217;s not yet in core. I always hope that it will come into core, but who knows? Corner Creative has one more question, &#8220;Will block guides be added to the Gutenberg block and core example? It&#8217;s hard to know when one block ends and another one begins without borders around the block.&#8221; Any comments on that?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, there has been a lot of design thought on how to best present the block editor. And the thing with the borders is that at some point, it sort of becomes very noisy and the UI can become harder to understand if you have borders around all the blocks. The hope currently is that the list view will do the heavy listing in terms of being able to understand the structure of the page and navigate it more easily. But yeah, that&#8217;s another point where &#8230; I mean yeah, there&#8217;s always going to be discussion around that and I think always going to be striving to sort of an ideal place. But it is a very complex interface and the more features there are and the more things you can do with it, the harder it is to find a UI that&#8217;s easy and intuitive to understand because you have to pack a whole lot of stuff into it. Yeah, that&#8217;s an interesting problem that I don&#8217;t think is going to be ever fully solved to everyone&#8217;s satisfaction.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Definitely something to keep working on.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, and there are plenty of plugins that handle just borders around blocks if you want to search those out. There may even be a browser extension I&#8217;ve seen at one point. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I think the list view has come a long way that when you click on a block in the list view, you get the borders around the block in the canvas or on the, yeah. I think that has come a way. And if it&#8217;s about teaching clients on how to use that, I think that would be the route that I would go. Say, &#8220;Okay, here is your friend, list view is your friend. And you have trouble, go to the list view.&#8221; It&#8217;s kind of that mantra that I would probably implement there to figure out, yeah, teach that, which are the blocks. All right, well we are coming &#8230; We are a little bit over, so I&#8217;m sorry about that, but we covered a lot of ground. Can you briefly, Andrew and Isabel talk about what&#8217;s next in layouts?</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Oh, great question. I think since we&#8217;ve gotten a lot of foundational work, the main thing is jumping into a lot of these experiments. So like Isabel was saying before, trying out how might a grid layout work, or some of those other ideas for position support. I think probably there&#8217;s a lot of experimenting before we get to things that seem stable enough to put into the plugin. I think probably be diving into a lot of that after 6.2 comes out.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, yeah, stabilizing the layout feature also so that extenders can use it. And that will be my number one priority at the moment. And adding layout to a few blocks that don&#8217;t have it yet, such as cover. And then there&#8217;s the bigger features such as grid, for instance, layout, maybe other types of layouts. We&#8217;ll see.</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, I just look forward to teaching all the stuff that y&#8217;all are working on. Teaching other people. Birgit, you&#8217;re muted.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: On mute. Last thing I wanted to share with a group is also the post that Justin just published on the developer blog, and it&#8217;s a walkthrough on the layout classes that came with WordPress 6.1. I think it&#8217;s a really a good post to slow walk you through all the things that you can do. Well, one last question, sorry about that. “Will it be possible to limit the use of some blocks based on user role?” Yes, is the short answer.</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Most likely plugin territory, right? Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And there are some capabilities where you, for instance, the custom CSS, you actually need to have the file editing privileges on your website to actually use that, before that too. So, not every user is able to do custom CSS, for instance, and then the block-locking features there can be attributed to in any role on the site. I think that&#8217;s…</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, there&#8217;s great documentation on just locking down things per role in the &#8230; It&#8217;s a document on Curating the Editor and the Block Editor Handbook. I don&#8217;t know the link offhand, but I think there should be an actual user role or something related to permissions setting.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I just shared the link in the chat, and I will also share that in the show notes.</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Okay.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right, I think we&#8217;re &#8230; Yeah, it&#8217;s all right. Okay. Well, this was a great show and thank you very much for being here. It was very interesting and I learned so much from you all. Thank you. If people want to get in contact with you, just let us know how that would be possible for Andrew, Isabel and Justin. Andrew, do you want to start?</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Oh yeah, I&#8217;ll probably say, yeah, open up an issue on the GitHub repo and feel free to ping any of us. There&#8217;s also the label feature layout, which is a good way to make sure that anything related to layout is seen by any of us, so it&#8217;s probably a good way to do it.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, excellent.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Yeah, GitHub is a good place. I am Tell The Machines on GitHub. I don&#8217;t use my real name, but you can also find me in the make core Slack.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay, cool. Cool. Justin?&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Yeah, Twitter, just JustinTadlock, or GitHub too, or Green Shady on WP Slack.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. And if you have more questions, those who are in attendance today will get an email tomorrow with a link to a survey. Tell us how you found it and what other topics you would like to see. And well, I want to just say thank you all for coming and have these great questions. It has been a privilege to have the panelists and the audience here, and we will have two more live Q&amp;As to come. One is about the design system that comes from Figma, bridge to the theme Jason automatically created out of our design system. And the other one is using Gutenberg as a framework to create plugins that are not using the block editor, but using the block editor components and the scripts to build their own app in WordPress and outside. All right, that is it. Thank you all for coming and be well. Talk to you later.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Andrew Serong</em>: Thank you.</p>



<p><em>Isabel Brison</em>: Thank you, bye-bye.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Bye-bye.</p>



<p><em>Justin Tadlock</em>: Bye.</p>

<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Hello and welcome to our 79th episode of the Gutenberg Changelog Podcast, recording February 3rd, 2023. In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 15.0, 15.1, as well as the upcoming major release of WordPress 6.2 and a little bit more. Not much more. Special guest today is Nick Diego, developer advocate at WP Engine, Block Editor Triage Squad, and On the Block Editor Triage Squad for WordPress 6.2. I am your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Good Work Times and full-time core contributor for the WordPress Opensource Project, sponsored by Automattic. Howdy, howdy, Nick. How are you doing? Thanks for joining me today as a co-host on the show, as it&#8217;s always a treat to geek out over Gutenberg with you. So how are you today?</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I&#8217;m doing great. Thank you so much for having me back on the show.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh yeah, it&#8217;s great pleasure. Yeah, thanks for coming back on. So we have a great show for you dear listeners, as mentioned, but we will take the WordPress 6.2 section at the beginning, so you all are up-to-date on that.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>WordPress 6.2</strong></h3>



<p>Hector Prieto published the WordPress 6.2 planning roundup with the schedule and the squad, and that has pretty much followed the earlier proposal. We talked about the schedule is Beta 1, scheduled for February 7th. That&#8217;s coming up fast, 2023. The release Candidate 1 will escape into the world on March 7th, that&#8217;s a month later. And the final release is scheduled for March 28th, 2023. Release Candidate 1 is also the time when the developer notes will be published, so they come out at the beginning of March.</p>



<p>The squad release lead is Matt Mullenweg. There are two release coordinators with Francesca Marano and Hector Prieto. So glad that Francesca is back in the saddle of coordinating with Core. Core tech leads are Tanya Morgan and John Baptiste Audras, and the editor tech colleagues are George Mamadashvili and Nik Tsekouras. I think I got this right. Core triage co-leads, Colin Stewart and Mukesh Panchal, and then editor co-leads, as mentioned, Nick Diego and Anne McCarthy. Design lead is Rich Tabor and Documentation co-leads, now we are a group of four with Femy Praseet, Milana Cap, and Apha Thakor. And then there are marketing community co-leads with Jonathan Patani, Lauren Stein and Mary Baum. Test co-leads are Robin Nasmore Hasan, and Adel Tahri. This time new on the WordPress, the release squad is a performance lead, and the first one is Felix Arntz from the performance team. So yeah. Nick, how are you doing with being on the editor triage co-leads?</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Oh, it&#8217;s been fun. So first this role was new in WordPress 6.0 and then we continued it for 6.1 and now 6.2 and I think we have a bit more method to the madness now. Things are a bit more organized, think we&#8217;re the most organized we&#8217;ve ever been before beta one has even come out. So I&#8217;m feeling pretty good right now as we head towards 6.2.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, so what does it exactly entail? If people don&#8217;t know what a triage co-lead is, what do you do there?</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: It&#8217;s mainly organization, so there&#8217;s a lot of issues and PRs that need to get included in 6.2. We do our best to make sure that any issue or feature that&#8217;s related to 6.2 appropriately has eyes on it, is appropriately getting handled and done. And we also are responsible for helping determine whether an issue maybe is important but maybe isn&#8217;t a blocker to the release, so maybe that can get moved to the next version of Gutenberg or the next 6.3. So it&#8217;s kind of managing all the pieces that are coming together at the end as we head into the final release. We also work with the editor tech co-leads on Backport. So once we get past beta, any new feature will need to get backed into the release and so we help handle that. So it&#8217;s really kind of a bit like an organizational role to make sure that the release goes as smoothly as possible.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s awesome. Yeah, I know that&#8217;s definitely worth having and you do awesome work. It&#8217;s also kind of managing some of the personalities at some point and also kind of what gets priority or not. It&#8217;s really interesting. Thanks for doing it. Again, it&#8217;s the third time that you are on the editor triage leads, right?</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, it is. And thank you for all the documentation work that you guys do, so it&#8217;s a lot of people in the process and to make the release go as smoothly as possible.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I can only repeat what you said. Thereafter, the first two, we all are kind of getting really organized on documentation. We now have, as a new feature, no, not feature, a person on the release team. We also have end user documentation person, Femy Praseet on the release squad. She can also be part of the release team and organize themselves pretty easily. And she gets all the information because that really wasn&#8217;t happening before and there was always, yeah, what is unnecessary for end user documentation versus developer notes and they&#8217;re still behind with end user documentation. They&#8217;re still working on 6.1, but knowing, okay, this is coming into 6.2 and getting the issues done. I also know that both the organization from Milana and Femy, the documentation team has increased in contributors and many of those are actually working on end user documentation. So I&#8217;m really glad that we have that now on the WordPress release team.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. And the documentation page on the website got a new redesign recently, which looks very cool. So if you haven&#8217;t seen that yet, go check out the documentation page on wordpress.org.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, is it live now?</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I believe it is, yeah.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay, cool, cool, cool. Because yeah, we have been waiting for on the developer blog, designed to actually follow the documentation design, so we&#8217;ll see how that&#8217;s going to work because the developer news blog is still out in beta. We haven&#8217;t officially released it, so we hope to get to that point quickly. Hopefully before WordCamp in Asia. Are you going to WordCamp in Asia?</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I am not, unfortunately. I&#8217;ll be jealous of everybody else who gets to go, but no, not this time unfortunately.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. All right. So yeah, with the Gutenberg plugins released, we talk quite a bit on the Gutenberg podcast about all the new features that come in. So I wanted, but still go over the high priority items that are in that one issue that Anne keeps updating and McCarthy keeps updating in the status of it. There are quite a few improvements or massive improvements and new features coming in with 6.2. So I think it can&#8217;t hurt if we look at those high visible items or important items together. They&#8217;re all cataloged by features. So it starts out with patterns and there are two things that come in. One is the pattern inserter next, that means inserter is starting with a list of categories for core as well as the third-party categories.</p>



<p>And then, with a click on the category, a panel opens with the patterns for that particular category in a thumbnail view. And I really like that. So you have to kind of, it makes necessary that the categories are very well defined, but it also kind of keeps the focus of the creator, the content creator on what they actually want to do and not distracted on all the other cool patterns. So that is definitely, and that has been in the Gutenberg plugin since the Gutenberg 14.4 release, so it should been quite refined.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. And I think it&#8217;s one of those things where it may seem minor to folks, but once you start using it, it&#8217;s like, wow, this is so much better than what it was before. I think it was a dropdown menu where you can select the different categories. So it&#8217;s great to see. And one of the other things that is included with patterns is kind of a re-envisioning of query patterns. So query loop patterns for end users specifically are not really familiar with the term query. It&#8217;s kind of a foreign term if you&#8217;re not deeply entrenched in WordPress. And so, that&#8217;s been changed to be posts, so it displays post summaries in lists or grids and other layouts. So I think it&#8217;s a little bit more user-friendly, and there was also some work to make sure that category descriptions are part of the rest API, which just make the pattern panel a little bit more interactive, a little bit more intuitive. So really great to see the direction that this went and hopefully will just make inserting patterns using patterns more usable for folks.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and it&#8217;s definitely also for when you have patterns for your plugins or something like that, you can add a description. It&#8217;s so much better than just have a title there to help the user figure out what they&#8217;re going to do with it. So there are six major items for the global styles. One is the way to document containing all blocks and styles. That&#8217;s the so-called style book, and that is really cool. We talked about it on the podcast before of course, but I really like that you can now see all the blocks that you use and that are in the theme in one overview, and also the third-party blocks. So if you make a change in the style editor in the global styles, you can see what the implication would be, especially for the blocks that you not use so often, but when you make a change, you can see the ramifications there.</p>



<p>And also when you make a change and you would think that it would go to another block because it uses the same block in a cover block or something like that, you see those things as well and are not surprised. Yeah, that has been missing for quite a while. I remember when I started at the agency, when we were starting with using blocks for post content, that we were always kind of trying to figure out, okay, does this seem style all the blocks well enough with the display? So we had one post that every single block was in there with different variations and then had to install it or copy paste it over to the sites to do unit testing. And that, of course, goes away now. And now we also have the third party blocks to view them in the Style book.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. It works really well. And to your point, I think a lot of folks were building out default pages with every block on it or multiple pages to try and do those testing and this just makes it so much easier. Kind of going hand in hand with that, there was also some improvement to when you edit block settings in global styles, they&#8217;ll now generate a little preview, which is handy. So before you edit the block, and let&#8217;s say that the block wasn&#8217;t actually on the page you were on in the site editor, now it will give you a little preview so you can see what you&#8217;re actually changing, which coupled with the style book really helps you get a better understanding of what you&#8217;re changing, how it&#8217;s changing, and how it&#8217;s going to affect your site. So those two together I think really help refine the global styles interface. And there&#8217;s still improvements to come, so a lot of good stuff.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes, and one of the other improvements that is coming with 6.2 is that you actually, and that goes hand in hand with the other two, is that you can now copy the style variations for block types. So if you added a style variation, there is a button block that is rounded, but you also want to change the background and then every button block should, with a rounded variation, should follow that design. You can make that happen by pushing that to the global block styles and have a style variation update on that as well. Yeah, it&#8217;s getting really, really sophisticated in terms of what you can manage as a site editor or site user, a site owner in terms of styling and being very deliberate in, okay, this my overall style and this is just for this post, and make sure that those were a tier two in a kind of quasi design system for the editor.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, and I think that you kind of look at it in two ways, and we&#8217;ll talk about this later in this episode, the create block theme plugin, but you have the global styles. So if you&#8217;re the owner of a website and you want to make changes to your site, that&#8217;s great for you. But I&#8217;ve also loved using the site editor to build themes, to build themes for yourself or clients or whatever. It&#8217;s a great building platform. And these tools that allow you to design a block style and then push it globally really speed up that development process when you&#8217;re building out a theme.</p>



<p>And then you can use something like the create block theme plugin, which we&#8217;ll talk about later again, where you can just export that as a complete package. And on top of that, one of the things that we&#8217;ve heard a lot about is, if you remember the customizer had an option where you could add custom CSS, right inside of the customizer, and I think people use that a lot for quick fixes or small little CSS snippets that you would want that you wouldn&#8217;t want to have to put into the style sheet of the theme.</p>



<p>Well, that&#8217;s actually coming now to Global Styles as well. There&#8217;ll be an input now for custom CSS that you can apply directly within the Global Styles panel to your theme, and there&#8217;s now going to be per block custom CSS as well, which is really cool. So if you want custom CSS specifically for a specific block, you can do that too. So, so many cool enhancements to global styles that really allow you, whether you&#8217;re an end user and you&#8217;re just managing your own site or you&#8217;re building block-based themes for others, so many cool features that really increase the power of the site editor in global styles.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, especially the custom styles. Custom CSS was a feature that kept also developers or theme developers to not adopt that much on block themes, but with that little feature to be very much in control of little fixes that don&#8217;t have to go back to the theme JSON and wherever for that one. That is really powerful. And yeah, it will come in, I think it came in with 15.1 to the Gutenberg, no, it came into 14.8, but it was refined later on. You don&#8217;t find it in the left menu, it will be in the styles menu. So it&#8217;s a little bit further away than before, but I think it&#8217;s also more focused to what it actually does.</p>



<p>Yeah, you&#8217;re not getting distracted when you don&#8217;t use it. So for the editor, there is one information that the documentation information and the outline of the list view is now together. So the information about how many words or how much time to read is now in the list view panel in a separate tab, and just recently it was actually changed that it comes from the bottom is again up on top so it&#8217;s not covered by the view post when you save it. And it&#8217;s a very nice design that came in now with, I think, 15.1.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, and we are starting to see, and we&#8217;ll see this more as we talk, but a more tab based design within the interface. So instead of having an icon that you click on to get that information, it&#8217;s now kind of part of the insertion tab and it goes hand in hand with some of the other things that we&#8217;ve seen, one of them being a new media tab. So when you go to insert blocks and patterns, you&#8217;ll now have a media tab where you can have direct access to your media library, which is really cool. It just kind of speeds up that flow. You can of course always add image block and then navigate to your media library and do the same thing, but this really just makes it a lot easier to add media to a page, which is neat. And then, oh sorry, go.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No, no, sorry. Yeah, the media tab is really helpful, especially when you just want to reuse some of the media that you just uploaded. Yeah, it kind of gives you direct access to it without having to have that modal come up. But what it also does is that gives you a basic open verse integration that is now available. So you can search the open verse. Open verse is the Creative Comments image library that is available at wordpress.org/openverse, and so you see images that are free to use on a website. And Steve Burge, actually, he reviewed the feature through the Gutenberg plugin before it even was out.</p>



<p>And we put the link in the show note, he wrote about it, about the open verse integration, and it&#8217;s so much easier to handle when you&#8217;re looking for pictures and you don&#8217;t have to go out on a new website. You don&#8217;t have to go out to the new place for your image and download it. It&#8217;s right there. You can access it. It will link to the open verse CDN, but there is a button in the image block where you can say download to media library so you have it again next time when you use it, when I use it again.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: And it&#8217;s such a cool thing and especially as open verse continues to grow, a good resource there. One other thing in regards to the editor that was introduced was it&#8217;s really kind of hard for a user to differentiate between just a static lock and those that are what we call sync, so template parts and reusable blocks. So while this is not the be all, end all solution, one thing that was added was to colorize synced blocks. Again, temple parts are your reusable blocks. So at first glance, it&#8217;s just easier to differentiate, oh, I&#8217;m editing something that impacts that could change things elsewhere on the site. So those synced blocks are now purple. So if you see purple when 6.2 comes out, that&#8217;s what that means.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Yeah, reusable block have the same content everywhere, and when you change them, it will be changed everywhere, and template parts, it&#8217;s just the styling of things. But yeah, it&#8217;s really interesting how different modals and how they&#8217;re so similar but then have a total different impact when you change it on your site. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Absolutely.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely worth going over the user documentation for that to just get it really figured out for your daily routine. Yeah. Another feedback was from the full site editing outreach program was that the people have a hard time between what are they editing and what are they looking at, and it now is now introduced in a browse mode that gives you, you can go through all your templates but not add anything. You have to click edit so you know that you are working on that particular template part. Before, when you clicked on the appearance site editor, you jump in right into your homepage for editing and that was kind of confusing because you that might not be what you wanted to edit, and it was also confusing that it only changed on the homepage but not everywhere else when you were doing something.</p>



<p>So there are some really good quality of life, so to speak, changes in 6.2 as well, but also to make the workflow a little bit more intuitive, a little bit more separated kind of separation of concerns. So the user is absolutely clear what they&#8217;re doing in terms of editing or viewing or adding. So there are a few changes that come through the tools section. That one is that the group block now has a setup state, so you can pick the variant.</p>



<p>Up until now, you&#8217;ve selected the group block, and then on the right hand side in the sidebar, you selected if it&#8217;s a row, a default, or a stacked block, and now you can do this right when you add it to your canvas, which is pretty cool. With it comes the feature to set a width for the blocks in a row. That means that you can really say, okay, these have the same distance, or you need to fill it up with the whole wording or something like that. It definitely helps controlling that. And there&#8217;s also one, you mentioned that in 15.1 that there&#8217;s now minimum height for the stack block group block.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, yeah. Minimum height seems like an innocuous change, but it is incredibly useful in various designs. And what we&#8217;re seeing in 6.2 is a lot of improvements to tools that we&#8217;ve had for a long time. So the stack block in particular has been one that it&#8217;s hard for people who don&#8217;t understand, who aren&#8217;t familiar with flex layouts, it&#8217;s like, well, what is this thing? Isn&#8217;t it kind of similar to just a group? It just vertically presents my content, right? Well, it&#8217;s actually much more tricky than that, but we&#8217;ve been missing some of the tools within the UI that allow you to do some cool things with stacks and rows. So, we&#8217;re at a point now with 15.1 and soon to be 6.2, WordPress 6.2, where we have a lot of these tools in the UI. And another one of those tools is fixed position or sticky position because one of the things that people have wanted a lot is the ability to have a header, which you see on a lot of websites, that sticks to the top of the browser window as you scroll down the page.</p>



<p>And this has been introduced in 15.0 where you can now set the position on blocks to be sticky. Now, this is an initial implementation of sticky and position in general. It&#8217;s going to be iterated on for 6.2. You will only be allowed to apply sticky to blocks that are at the root of the page. So that would be things like sticky headers, mainly because there&#8217;s some UX concern. People understanding how sticky&#8217;s kind of a complicated CSS property. So making sure that it&#8217;s really clear to folks when they apply sticky, how it&#8217;s going to impact the page. So there&#8217;s some UX issues there in terms of expanding sticky and other positioning elements throughout the interface, but this is a good first step and it does allow for sticky headers and footers, which is awesome. So a lot of fun things to play with for theme developers specifically that can reduce the amount of custom CSS you need.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I know we all talked quite a bit about the sticky headers, but I also find sticky footers even more important because that&#8217;s where my thumb is when I look at the mobile version of a website. So don&#8217;t discount the sticky photos.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Absolutely. Absolutely.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And yeah, that could be next pages navigation or new features or get totally out of the website with something else, but that can be all done from the footer. Yeah, there were some updates on the blocks as well that are coming to 6.2. There are many, many more, but as I said, these are all the priority items. These are the things that are worked on to actually come to 6.2 period. And one of them is that they fixed the layout jumps selecting an image. That was actually very early in the release cycle in 14.4 plugin release.</p>



<p>But now, and the second one is also the split block toolbar in the sidebar, what you mentioned that there&#8217;s more tabbing going on. The team separated the settings from the appearance in the block sidebar and it was completed in 14.7 and there are certainly some updates later on. And I don&#8217;t know exactly, I have this question since I saw it, and I have not researched it. But do you know if there&#8217;s a way for third-party developers to decide where their settings are going or is that still all coming into settings?</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: So yes, I was a big part of making sure that that was possible. Well, I didn&#8217;t do it, but I was advocating for that because one of the good examples is color. Color is clearly an appearance type thing style, but a lot of third-party plugins, or even some core plugins, register their own color pickers. So because that&#8217;s not generated by block support, it&#8217;s a custom implementation, it would by default land in settings. So there would need to be a way to move your custom color panel to styles, especially for user experience because someone&#8217;s, okay, we now have the style tab, wait, colors in settings? So that has been done. So there&#8217;s now a way to define a group on your panels. So if you can say group style and it will end up in the style panel, if you say group setting, it will end up in the settings panel.</p>



<p>By default, if you don&#8217;t define a group, and this is something that we&#8217;ll need to put together in a dev note and especially for the field guide for 6.2, if you don&#8217;t define a group, it&#8217;s going to default to settings just because WordPress doesn&#8217;t know what it is. But you can easily update your third-party block or whatever to define what side you want to be on, which is fantastic. I think the tab situation is really good for user experience because I think we&#8217;ve all seen sidebars that you got to scroll forever to see all the different functionality there. So separating that into styles and settings is great. We just now need to make sure that third-party folks can put stuff where they want it and we have the documentation on showing how to do that.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah, I think the next step for the sidebar would be that a user can actually move things around. So yeah, if you want to, but that is, well, a girl can dream, right? And then there is a change or an update and make it easy to copy and paste block styles. So when you have two paragraphs and you change the first one, the styling, like the background of the color, you can say there&#8217;s another menu item in the ellipse menu on the block where say copy styles and then you can go to the next paragraph and you can then paste the style with the same menu item. And that is definitely very powerful. We had reuse of the styles when you create buttons, a row of buttons. Every time you had them styles and then you add a new button, it took over the style from the previous button. That was automatically done, but we didn&#8217;t have that for the single blocks, like for instance, a paragraph block. So this is definitely quite powerful.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. And I want to stress here that when you are copying and pasting styles, what it&#8217;s doing is it&#8217;s copying and pasting styles provided by block supports. So things like dimensions and color, things that are when a block opts into native block supports. So I think that as we move forward, third-party blocks have an incentive to opt into native WordPress controls more than ever, because one, when you opt into native WordPress controls, it&#8217;s very easy. You get all those controls there for you with a single line of code. And two, now we have some additional functionality like copy and paste that supports those native block supports.</p>



<p>So I think this is a very subtle change, but it is really going to start helping hopefully standardize third-party blocks to use core block supports as much as possible, which in the end really improves that user experience. Because if you&#8217;re a new user to WordPress, you just learned how to apply dimension controls or order or whatever, and then you go to a third-party block that doesn&#8217;t have those controls or has a complete custom set of controls, it&#8217;s quite jarring. So I think little changes like this will start incentivizing third-party block developers to standardize around core block supports, which in the end will just improve WordPress across the board. So very excited for this one.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s great. Very good point. And there are quite a few plugin developers that now, amongst you, that provide additional functionality for it. And if they get additional features that they can use that are maintained by core committers, instead of themselves, it definitely makes the updates easier to propagate. And in the list of 6.2 high priority items, the last one is providing a pathway to migrate widgets to block themes. So what that means is if you are using a classic theme and you switch over to a block theme, it will make it available for you to have the same widgets can now be added to a footer or to a sidebar that&#8217;s in the block theme and you don&#8217;t have to recreate them again as you had to do before. So this is always also a good pathway for adoption of block themes when the migration from a classic theme to a block theme is a little bit easier now.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, this is a great thing. I mean, it&#8217;s just one step to make that transition process easier, which we all know it&#8217;s not seamless. I mean, it takes some work to go from classic to block based, but this goes a long way.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I see sometimes some questions on Twitter and other places where, how do I convert my classic theme to a block theme? And I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s really possible. I think because they both have so different paradigms to think of, what is the same is the template hierarchy, but I think the block-based approach is so much richer feature set for the user that it&#8217;s not possible to do this one to one transition. There are certainly ways to do that in particular parts. So you could have template parts that are block based on your classic theme, or here, like the migrate the widgets over to block themes, but there is not a one-to-one translation possible because of the different based architecture and paradigms.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right, so these were the major points of 6.2. I know there are many, many other smaller changes or that came across without being the high priority, but they&#8217;re still very helpful for 6.2.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>



<p>Now, I wanted to point out some community contributions and then we get into the release of Gutenberg 15.0 and 15.1. And so, I wanted to point out the advanced query loop plugin by Ryan Welcher. He adds variations for that post loop that we talked about. He calls it a query loop because that&#8217;s what he builds his variation on, but also for date filtering, you can now also, if you use that plugin, you can also have pages that are just per author or for custom post types or custom fields. So he has really expanded that query loop or the post loop in the block editor, so you get a lot of variety and variations that you can use for the more expanded block themes. Because those are still the idea out there that it&#8217;s for simple websites, block themes are good, but not for complex ones.</p>



<p>And this is definitely helping. This advanced query loop plugin is definitely helping expanding that. You can certainly learn more about it as he builds out his Ryan live streams, all his work live on Twitch every Thursday from 10:30 PM Eastern AM, PM right? No, I&#8217;m sorry. He live streams his work live on Twitch every Thursday, 10:30 AM, and then after a week or so he also updates the recording to YouTube and that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find his work on the advanced query loop plugin. And of course. We share those all in the show notes. Well, if you ping him on Slack or on Twitter or on his Discord, you can certainly also make requests to what to show in the Twitch stream. So this is really cool. Yeah, Ryan has done this now for a year and he has quite the following on there, but it&#8217;s definitely hands-on programming with blocks and plugins and additional custom fields. There&#8217;s quite a variety there.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: And it&#8217;s a fantastic resource for learning, especially for folks who want to build very advanced things. Whether you&#8217;re going to use his plugin, advanced query loop, or not, watching him build it will give you tons of resources and tools to build your own custom blocks. It shows how sophisticated block-based development can be. It&#8217;s not just your simple paragraph block and image. I mean, you can do some really powerful things with blocks and create some really sophisticated interfaces for users. So even if you don&#8217;t need advanced query loop, check out his stream because you&#8217;ll learn a lot of good tips and tricks on how to build your own custom stuff.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haac</em>k: Yeah, and for me, what&#8217;s also a good value is when I watch Ryan do his work, sometimes he runs into something where he says, I didn&#8217;t know where to do that, or there was a mistake and just his workflow on how to debug things and where to look up things. Yeah, it&#8217;s such helpful to watch for your own research and how to handle all the difference, be it the console on the browser or be it the arrow debug log or all the tools that you have. He uses them and he uses them as an expert, but also, when he starts out with something and said, how does this work? Or why doesn&#8217;t it work? It&#8217;s definitely good. Yeah, it also helps me with my imposter syndrome.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. We all make mistakes, we all make mistakes, and he does a good job showing you how to dig out from them.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: If we all make mistakes, what happens next is the clue for fixing it. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: I mean, half of development is Googling things, right?</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. Yeah. And there&#8217;s another plugin, and you mentioned it before, Nick, when we were going through the 6.2 thing was the create theme plugin. And that is created by developers from WordPress and as a tool for theme developers that are not touching code. So you could export a current block theme with the changes you made in templates, template parts, and global styles. That&#8217;s so powerful. And it also has other features. You can create a new child theme from the activated theme and then the activated theme becomes the parent theme. You can also create a completely new theme cloning the activated theme, and the result theme has all the assets of the activated theme and all the user changes. So that is also quite powerful and it saves the user changes as theme changes and deletes the user changes. So they&#8217;re saved in the theme in the folder and the theme JSON is updated and all that.</p>



<p>You could also use that plugin to actually create an empty theme, which sometimes you want to just start out fresh. And just recently there&#8217;s a new feature that came in that&#8217;s saves your user changes as a style variation. Remember, the 2023 theme was built with community support on the style variations. They had 38 submissions of style variations and then 10 of those came into theme 2023. But now you can actually create those style variations with the site editor and have your own personal theme 2023 style variation. So Daisy Olsen has started also a weekly live stream on Twitch and for Friday 10:30.</p>



<p>And she has been demoing how to use it and all she talks about is block themes, but also how to then use all the tools that are available. She posts also her recordings on YouTube. I know that Twitch removes videos after 14 days, so all the Twitch streamers are moving recordings over to YouTube when it&#8217;s appropriate. So those are two plugins that you definitely want to check out when you are new to two block themes. But Nick, you also have some great plugins in the repository. And do you have an update on them? I know it&#8217;s the block visibility plugin. What does that do? And then the icon block.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, so I built block visibility thinking a year and a half ago now as a way to teach myself some of these new techniques. How do blocks work? I taught myself React to build this block, to build this plugin. And the plugin does something very simple. It was something that I used to have in classic WordPress where you could show, or dynamically show or hide content. Usually you do that with a short code or something like that. I was very popular with widgets. There were tons of plugins that would allow you to only show this widget on pages with certain categories or whatever. And so, in a block-based world where everything on a website is a block, well you then have a consistent type of content that if you can interact with it, if you can do something for a block, then you can basically dynamically show any part of your website.</p>



<p>So that&#8217;s where the genesis of block visibility came about as my own fun little project. It&#8217;s grown considerably. It&#8217;s now at 8,000 active users, which kind of surprises me. And the interesting thing about it is not really the plugin itself, but more so that I am personally anecdotally starting to see a decent uptick in people activating and using block plugins. The icon block is super simple. It&#8217;s literally a way to show SVG icons in a block format. And I tried to build it in a way that is as close to core as possible. It&#8217;s functionality that probably would never be in core because working with SVGs is not really something probably core wants to deal with, but it uses as many block supports as possible, which I try to make it as much like core as possible just for a fun side project. That also just reached 8,000 active users.</p>



<p>So if people are looking to build plugins, I&#8217;ve historically been a plugins developer. I have built themes before, but I like building plugins more. I&#8217;ve built widgets, I&#8217;ve built short codes, I&#8217;ve built all sorts of different plugins. But building blocks is really fun. And we now have tools like the Create Block Package that I know Ryan has put a lot of time and effort into supporting. It&#8217;s so much easier to build with blocks now than it used to be. And if you&#8217;re kind of on the fence about building custom blocks, I encourage you to do so.</p>



<p>One, there&#8217;s seemingly the market for them, and two, it&#8217;s such a fun ecosystem to play in. So I really enjoyed my two plugins. They&#8217;re doing quite well, which I&#8217;m proud of and thankful to the community for supporting. And I think that we really need, in this new block-based world, we need a rich ecosystem of third-party plugins to do niche functionality that core might not support. So I&#8217;m the biggest champion of folks building custom blocks, whether they&#8217;re on the repo or for yourself. And if you need help, let Ryan or myself know and we&#8217;ll help you with it. But yeah, start building blocks.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, thank you so much. And also to kind of just trail blaze a little bit more, you were ahead of the curve there as well. And how did that turn out? Yeah, I think the last time you were on the show, we were talking about your build a block in 15 minutes talk for WordCamp US, and it was quite interesting to see. I was in the show and yeah, what were the comments afterwards? Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Tons of positive feedback. I think that, and honestly, more of that kind of thing we need to do. I know that there&#8217;s a lot of folks who build websites for clients and they&#8217;re on time constraints. They don&#8217;t have time necessarily to completely learn something new. Whatever it might be is maybe holding them back from working with blocks. Maybe they don&#8217;t even need to work with blocks because their workflow doesn&#8217;t require it. That being said, I think there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity, especially after 6.2. I think back to this time last year where WordPress was. We have introduced so much functionality. It&#8217;s so much easier to build a block theme. It&#8217;s so much easier to build a custom block. I look at 2023 as the age of maturity for block-based WordPress. I mean, we&#8217;re at a point now where you can do so much and build so many sophisticated interfaces. And I&#8217;m starting to see more and more people picking up blocks, exploring blocks. So yeah, it&#8217;s an exciting time to be in WordPress.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And thank you for being such an advocate for block development and all that.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gutenberg 15.0</strong></h3>



<p>So, that brings us to the Gutenberg plugin releases. We have two to cover. The main things we already kind of talked about in the 6.2 thing, but the Gutenberg 15.0 was released on January 18th. It had 109 merch PRs by 42 contributors. Seven of them were first time contributors. Yay, first time contributors, congratulations.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>



<p>And we had a few enhancements. One was allowing the resource of the sidebar frame for the side editor. So the side editor has on the left hand side the menu where template parts and templates and other things, forgot what it was. There are more menus there. And now you can change the frame, the space that the sidebar takes from your canvas, which is really cool. You never had that before.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. Also, if you slide it all the way, you can also see what the site looks like in mobile view, because it also resizes the site editor itself. So that&#8217;s a really cool one.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it does it only in browse mode. When you click on the edit button, the blue edit button, you kind of get the full editor again, full screen editor, but that&#8217;s for the menu item. Yeah. And then your big W or side icon gets you back to the menu out of the editor. So that&#8217;s kind of the workflow from browse mode to edit mode. Yeah. Then yeah, go ahead.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: So I was going to say, one of the cool things that was kind of frustrating for folks, that if you were in a certain mode in the editor and you refresh it, sometimes that mode won&#8217;t stick. So now that&#8217;s synchronized. So if you were to edit a mode and then refresh your page, it will go back to the same state that you were just in. So small little like quality of life improvements, but big ones if you&#8217;re in the site editor all the time. And another quality improvement was copy and paste, the shortcuts for copy and paste, now work in the site editor, which obviously is seemingly small, but a very important fix that we&#8217;re seeing there.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And you only notice it when they don&#8217;t work. But yeah, when you try to do control C, control X and control V or command V for the paste and in which you use on any other editor around the world, be it your email, be it your Word or your Google Docs or even and all of a sudden in the editor it doesn&#8217;t work. So yeah, it definitely has been updated there. Now it comes to you. We talked about paste style to the block settings. Yeah, we talked about that. And then it&#8217;s now in 15.0, so if you upgrade your plugin to 15.1, 15.0 is still out. Yeah, 15.1 hasn&#8217;t been out yet. It&#8217;s only going to be released on February 8th, but you will be able to use those paste styles. And the next one is prevent an image from being resized larger than its container. Yeah, that was one of the things that really mixed up your layouts when that was not handled, but now it is and that&#8217;s a very good thing.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah. Working with image sometimes in the editor is tricky, and I think that this really makes it much more intuitive in the editor, between the editor view and the front end view. So that was a really good improvement to see there.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And you see the borders now, so you know when you kind of go into outside the container and then it doesn&#8217;t let you, yeah.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Next up we have some improvements to navigation. There&#8217;s a lot of improvements to navigation between 5.0 and 5.1. For longtime observers of the Gutenberg project, navigation is probably one of the hardest things to get right and there&#8217;s so many moving parts in managing there. So, little improvements like add an icon, add a sub menu item option. There was a Phantom ghost inserter little artifact that was there that was confusing. Improving loading indicators and replacing setting menus when custom. This is going to sound too complicated, but lots of improvements to navigation that make it more intuitive and make the workflows better. And we&#8217;ll actually see some more of those as we continue into 15.1.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, right. Yeah, the navigation block actually got a complete redesign or thinking of the process of creating menus in the block editor and it became the page list block got kind of a rejuvenation and a repurposing for that. So it&#8217;s in the sidebar, you can use the page list block, or the sidebar uses the page list block to actually create the menus. So there are some noise additional features in that particular block as well. Then the sidebar tabs, we talked about the block inspector tabs experiment with the split controls for the tabs. It will not see an additional tab whenever you use the navigation block and then it kind of uses the off canvas kind of navigation editor for that.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, so back to we were talking about tabs, so more tabs in the interface. And I think that once you get, it&#8217;s a little jarring, from before, but once you get used to it, it&#8217;s such an improvement. So now instead of having to manage the navigation menu all the way in the actual block, you can do it right on that sidebar off canvas functionality within the tab. So yeah, you&#8217;ll start to see a lot of tabs, but it&#8217;s a good thing. It will really make editing easier.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Especially for the navigation block where you never had enough space to do something like that or you never hit the right block or right border or right inserter. That was quite some confusion going on and this is definitely coming to 6.2, the total rethinking about the navigation block. And there are little things there. We talked about the next item is the edit the block style variations for global styles. We talked about that. That is now in Gutenberg 15.0 available. So try it out and see how that&#8217;s going to work. And those were the highlights from 15.0.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, there was one more, which was the sticky support for position, which we talked about. So that will be coming in 6.2 specifically for blocks that are not in containers. So that will enable sticky headers and footers. Again, this is kind of a first implementation, and as we move forward with Gutenberg and WordPress 6.3, there&#8217;ll be more position functionality, but this is a good first step.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And if you want to help testing that, use the Gutenberg 15.0 plugin a version and just play around with it. And the more feedback you get in before beta, then the core contributors can fix some of the things that they haven&#8217;t found before, because they haven&#8217;t used it as much as you would. So yeah, that definitely will help how that&#8217;s going to turn out in 6.1, 6.2, sorry. Good. So that was 15.0. I haven&#8217;t seen anything else come in there.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gutenberg 15.1</strong></h3>



<p>Then let&#8217;s get right into 15.1 with the caveat that we are looking at the change log from 15.1 release candidate one, which was released on February 1st. The final release will be February 7th and everything that comes in before on Monday, no, on Tuesday will be in beta one from that particular release. So that is actually feature freeze from main features. All right. Do you want to take it on?</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, yeah. So the first thing going back to navigation was, in the site editor, there&#8217;s now in the browse mode, there&#8217;s now a navigation section where you can move around and manipulate the navigation menu. This is kind of an initial implementation and we&#8217;ll see in the future how much more gets built out, but it&#8217;s kind of neat. You can, in browse mode, you can modify your main navigation easily. The initial implementation is starting to look a lot like that, the classic menu management screen where it&#8217;s kind of an abstracted view of the menu and you can move things around and adjust things. So it&#8217;s a really interesting start. Personally, I would love to see in that browse menu sidebar being able to edit your templates, your template parts and your navigation and see all your menus there. A first step, but a really good one, and I think it&#8217;s really intuitive and it will be helpful for users to edit navigation menus.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, the next big feature that is coming with 15.1 is the add shadow presets and UI tools and global styles. The box shadow was already in there, but now it comes with a UI for users to change the drop shadows in the global styles. It&#8217;s a first iteration. Oh no, there won&#8217;t be any. It&#8217;s only going to be for button. And there is on the developer news blog, Justin Tadlock, who has quite a nice tutorial on how the block shadow feature is going to work for themes. So yeah, it&#8217;s definitely something that was missing before. Yeah, any thoughts on that?</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, so the shadow functionality and what Justin wrote about is you can add drop shadows via manually adding the attributes to a block. So if you&#8217;re a theme developer, you&#8217;re designing a template and you can manually add that to the template file. We were just really missing that UI and the preset functionality. Similar to sticky UI for shadow and user experience for the shadow control is a little tricky, which is why the first implementation was get the functionality there from a template builder from a code perspective and now we&#8217;re starting to see the presets and the UI tools. So right now, there&#8217;s UI in global styles for button to add a global button styles with Shadow. First implementation, assuming that all works well and is intuitive, it will then be rolled out to additional blocks.</p>



<p>So the next one, I just wanted, it&#8217;s pretty minor, but I think it&#8217;s one that&#8217;s been sitting around since early last year. So a lot of blocks now you can add HTML anchors to or ID tags to. And dynamic blocks did not have this functionality. So things like post lists and I&#8217;m not remembering off the top of my head all the dynamic blocks that we have, but now it does. So anchor block is now supported across dynamic blocks. Pretty small change, but one that was needed because navigation and navigation items are dynamic blocks and so they did not have HTML anchor support. So a small little thing that people have been asking for a long time. It&#8217;s good to see that that&#8217;s been included.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really hard to target multiple things that don&#8217;t have at ease and could be really good. Yeah. And yeah, 15.1 comes with a ton of changes to the navigation block. Part of it is the off-camera navigation as a default experience. Then adding manage menu buttons for the menu selector dropdown. So, if you switch from one theme to the next, menus are persistent. And also, if you change from the classic to your block theme, you will find your classic themes menu available through the navigation block. That&#8217;s also very seamless now. And there are also custom labels for the navigation block view through the list view appender so you can name things quite a bit. We talked about copy and pasting styles menu items to separate menu group? No, we didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s also navigation enhancement where you can copy and paste styles menu items to a separate menu group so it shows up in different places where you use that.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, little enhancements that go a long way. As we move down the list here, we also saw a lot of improvements to the custom CSS, the ability to add that custom CSS right in global styles, some refinements to descriptions, refinements to what we&#8217;re calling it. Also, the custom CSS used to be just a panel that you would see immediately when you went into Global Styles. It&#8217;s been a little bit more hidden. The main reason, once you know where it is, very easy to find, but for new users to the site editor, it&#8217;s a little overwhelming to be presented with all those options. So now that is a bit hidden within the global styles.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and it also comes with a validation kind of process. So when you add your customer CSS to make sure that that&#8217;s actually valid code, it gives you a little message there and checks it out. So it&#8217;s really good. There&#8217;s also the per block custom CSS. We talked about it earlier. It comes with 15.1. It&#8217;s very late in the process to be tested quite a lot in the Gutenberg plugin. But check it out and see how that works for you. I&#8217;m really interested on the use case for that. I also saw a use case or request for use case for getting post single post custom CSS panel, but that is, I think, will stay plugins territory.</p>



<p>There is a plugin in the Repo where you can do that, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to come to core because it&#8217;s not block-based anymore. It&#8217;s kind of content based and that&#8217;s a little bit tricky to do. Yeah, and you mentioned it before, 15.1 also adds some of the missing controls to the flex layouts, the vertical alignment for the stack blocks, and also the ability for minimum height in the stacks and make the flex layouts now really powerful for theme developers as well as site owners.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, really excited for this one. This is going to reduce the amount of custom CSS themed developers need to build some sophisticated layouts. Really a cool one. One of those little minor things on the list here, but actually is super impactful.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I see we also highlighted, for the sticky position, you mentioned it before. It&#8217;s a block that&#8217;s not on a root block. Kind of being on the canvas will not be able to be sticky for now because the user experience concerns are a little bit not yet worked out. So it will be a limited functionality. And then the last part is renaming. So web fonts has been around, talked about since 6.0, was supposed to get in 6.0. There was a big flag raised from Core Committers and since then the core team has worked on that. 15.1 comes with a rename of the font&#8217;s API, but I also saw in our release channel on the Mac block that Tanya Mork announced that the fund&#8217;s API won&#8217;t make it into 6.2. She posted it on February 1st in the release channel. That is actually public. You can anytime kind of go into the six dash two dash release dash leads channel on the Make WordPress Slack and see what the discussion is about.</p>



<p>So, it will not make it. It&#8217;s slated for the Gutenberg plugin in 15.1, but it comes out only a day after beta one for 6.1. So 6.2 and it won&#8217;t make it the API. She finds it needs several Gutenberg releases to stabilize. And after they did a complete rewrite on it and renamed it and the last rewrites happened for Gutenberg 15.1, but that&#8217;s just too close to the beta release. The next focus will be to getting the API stabilized, assessing and improving the performance of it, and then adding automatic font and queuing for all fonts in clover styles. And then developers upgrading to use a new API with a backwards compatibility layer. And that is temporary. So all those seem to be doable to target very early for the 6.3 release alpha. That kind of starts after 6.2 is released, which is in May. So they&#8217;ll find things in the core nightly and goodnight nightly after the 6.2 release.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s one of those things where it&#8217;s taken a while, but it needs to take a while to make sure everything is in the right shape. And we just got to wait a little bit longer, but very soon we&#8217;ll be able to test it in the Gutenberg plugin, which is awesome.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And then we have one last item, I think, from 15.1 that we talk about. Make child themes inherit parents style variation, which is pretty cool.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, block themes is one of those things where people are familiar with child themes and block themes obviously want to support child themes as well. And if you have a parent with a bunch of style variations like 2023 and you want to make a few changes in a child theme, you want to also pull those style variations over. So a nice intuitive improvement to child theming in a block based world.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, and that, dear listeners, concludes our Gutenberg plugin 15.1 release change log. And we are pretty much at the end of the show. And it&#8217;s been quite the long show, but it&#8217;s also important to talk about what&#8217;s going to buoy you in 6.2. So thank you so much, Nick, on walking us through or going with me as a co-host through all those different changes and talk about the advantages and disadvantages of many, many things.</p>



<p><em>Nick Diego</em>: Yeah, thank you again for having me. I cannot wait for the 6.2 release. I think we&#8217;re going to get so many new functionality that will empower block builders, block theme builders, end users, so on and so forth. So very much looking forward to it. And thanks again for having me.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes, and that&#8217;s wonderful. So, as always, the show notes will be published. At gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is the episode 79, and if you have questions or suggestions or news you want to include, send them to <a href="mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s <a href="mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. And I also want to have, I will share the last WP Briefing episode by Josepha Hayden Chomphosy, where she talks about now if Gutenberg part two is kind of coming to an end, what does that mean? We still will add refinements to the plugin into the editors, even if the collaboration phase kind of starts soon in 2023. But I will share that so you can hear it from the executive director of the open source project. I also am really excited for the 6.2 release, and I hope people hear you with the episode 80 of the Gutenberg change log in about two to four weeks. I have not yet scheduled it, but I&#8217;m also traveling, so I&#8217;m kind of be patient. It will arrive in your inbox in your podcast. All right, that&#8217;s it. Thank you for listening and goodbye and have a wonderful time with testing 6.2. Bye bye.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy, </p>



<p><strong>WordCamp Asia</strong> will be in less than two weeks! Will I see you there? Just in case, I share my <a href="https://calendly.com/pauli-haack/wcasia?month=2023-02">public calendar, so you could self-schedule </a>a meeting with me. With the deliberate act to schedule an encounter, it ensures it will actually happen.  Once they started, WordCamps get really busy, and then I live in the moment, try to be present in every conversation and might lose track of time. So even with the best of intentions, we could miss each other. </p>



<p>For those who won&#8217;t make it to the in-person WordCamp, <a href="https://asia.wordcamp.org/2023/schedule/livestream/"><strong>the Livestream schedule </strong></a>is already published and displays date/times in your timezone. I compiled <a href="https://gutenbergtimes.com/wordcamp-asia-2023-eight-gutenberg-related-talks/">a list of eight Gutenberg related talks</a>, mostly for my own benefit.  </p>

You also find a visual discussion on the information architecture of the Global Styles feature in the Site editor, how a Custom&nbsp;CSS&nbsp;feature would look with error highlighting, how pointers of notes could be added to the sidebar. </p>



<p>Furthermore, you can also see some variation for Link Control and Shadow design tools. The design and meta teams working hard to get the redesigns of the WordPress.org site implemented. </p>



<p>The 20-year anniversary of the first WordPress release will be this year, and it deserves a 21st century look and feel. I am super-stoked about the fantastic work of the design team! </p>

<p>The release of <strong>Gutenberg 15.1</strong> has been move to a week later, and will come out on February 8th, 2023. JuanMa Garrido is the release lead. It&#8217;s the last Gutenberg plugin version that will be merged with WordPress core for the next major release 6.2. Beta for 6.2 is on February 7, 2023. If you&#8217;d like to start testing the latest features, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v15.1.0-rc.1">plugin file from the release candidate.</a></p>

<p><strong>Nick Diego</strong> and I recorded the Gutenberg Changelog #79 on Friday, and it will arrive at your favorite podcast app over the weekend. We covered a lot of ground including the high-priority features coming to a WordPress instance near you with 6.2 as well as the Gutenberg version 15.0 and 15.1. We also talked a bit about some tooling via plugins. </p>

<p>Recently, I saw the question more often: how to migrate a classic theme to a block theme. Sorry, I don&#8217;t remember where, though. </p>



<p>In the Themes handbook, I found a chapter on exactly that topic:  <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/block-themes/converting-a-classic-theme-to-a-block-theme/"><strong>Converting a classic theme to a block theme</strong></a>. Unfortunately, there is not 1:1 migration process on button click. The paradigm changes are too fundamental. The general concepts of a migration are covered in the post <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/block-themes/converting-a-classic-theme-to-a-block-theme/#gradually-adopting-the-full-site-editing">Gradually adopting the Site Editing features</a>.

<p>Now that feature freeze for the major WordPress release is only three weeks away, the contributors would appreciate it if you could heed the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/01/11/fse-program-testing-call-20-find-your-style/"><strong>20th call for testing from the FSE Outreach program.</strong></a> You can help find quirks, bugs and annoyances, so they can be fixed before February 7th and during the round of beta version of the release. </p>



<p>Have a lovely weekend! </p>

<p>Last April, a group of contributors started working on research on how to best implement an API for to make blocks more interactive. This week, <strong>JuanMa Garrido</strong> shared a progress report: <strong><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/01/11/update-on-the-work-to-make-building-interactive-blocks-easier/">Update on the work to make building interactive blocks easier</a>. </strong></p>



<p>The resources linked in the post are mostly code internals, so they are definitely very technical at this point. With that said, understanding how the new API works, will not be necessary for developers to use this new standard. A standard proposal will be published the next few months. So for now, this is all bit technical and architectural. The work on the underlying framework is shared on <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/block-hydration-experiments">this GitHub Repository</a></p>

<p><strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> reports on the <a href="https://wptavern.com/lettre-newsletter-theme-now-available-on-wordpress-org"><strong>Lettre Newsletter Theme Now Available on WordPress.org</strong></a>, It can be used with the newly release newsletter feature in Jetpack plugin or as a stand-along theme. &#8220;The theme puts the focus on the subscription form, which is the most important thing a newsletter landing page can do – make it easy for people to sign up. Beneath the form there is a link to read all the posts, followed by another subscription form. All of these elements in the home page design are blocks, making it easy for them to be removed or rearranged.&#8221; Gooding wrote. </p>

<p><strong>Will Morris</strong> explained the three ways <strong><a href="https://torquemag.io/2023/01/table-of-contents-wordpress/">add a Table of Contents in WordPress</a></strong>  in is post for the <em>Torque Magazine</em>. The three ways are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Install a plugin</li>



<li>Use on the Custom Table of Contents blocks</li>



<li>Create you Table manually in the Block Editor. </li>
</ul>



<p>Soon you will be able to use the core Table of Content&#8217;s block once it comes out of the experimental stage. It&#8217;s already available via the Gutenberg plugin. </p>

<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Hello, and welcome to the 78th episode of the Gutenberg Changelog podcast. In this first episode of 2023, I wish all our listeners a wonderful, happy, prosperous and healthy new year. In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg releases 14.8, 14.9, WordPress 6.2 and beyond. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate, a full-time contributor to WordPress Open Source project. My guest today is Hector Prieto, full-time contributor on the WordPress Core team, coordinating multiple WordPress and Gutenberg releases. And it&#8217;s a great pleasure to finally have you on the show, Hector. Having a conversation about Gutenberg and WordPress with you is a wonderful way for me to start this new year. Happy New Year, feliz año nuevo, Hector. How are you today?</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Happy New Year. Hi, Birgit. I&#8217;m excited to join you on the podcast. It&#8217;s my pleasure.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, the pleasure is really all mine. Where are you right now? Did you have a great holiday break?</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: I&#8217;m currently in Alicante in Spain, very close to the Mediterranean Sea. And today we have a lovely sunny winter day with nearly 20 degrees Celsius. I had a few days to recharge and spend time with the family. What about you, did you enjoy your holidays?</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, that&#8217;s some warm weather there in Alicante. I would love to have that. But here in Florida it&#8217;s balmy, too. It&#8217;s about 27 degrees, so we are in the air conditioning right now. Yes, my husband and I, we spent the week in Mexico City between Christmas and New Year&#8217;s. We saw some great art, powerful murals from the &#8217;50s and &#8217;70s and &#8217;60s. And we had fantastic food and a fabulous New Year&#8217;s event. It was great, at a restaurant over the roofs of Mexico City, so we really liked it.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Wow, sounds really nice.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, Hector, as you are the first time on the show, maybe you can share briefly with our listeners your WordPress origin story. When did you come across WordPress the first time and what do you work on now?</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Well, my first time working with WordPress was around 2015 when I worked at the startup agency building sites. However, it wasn&#8217;t until 2020 that I first moved into the contributor space, and here we are. I am currently sponsored by Automattic to work full-time in Core in project management-related duties and supporting the development of WordPress.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s wonderful. Well, thank you. So 2015, that&#8217;s just about two years before Gutenberg was introduced into the community. Did you, at your agency, have Gutenberg on the radar already, or did you heed the call to learn JavaScript deeply?</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: It wasn&#8217;t until 2018 that we started using Gutenberg for the first time, when it was first released in 5.0.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Then the time between learning about WordPress and then starting contributing, that&#8217;s about five years. That&#8217;s pretty much the time that it took me to really embrace the contributing on WordPress, but I started at the Community Project in 2014.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>



<p>All right, so there are a few announcements that were happening since the last podcast episode. If you haven&#8217;t watched it yet, the recording of Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s State of the Word is available on WordPress TV. The transcript and answers to the questions that didn&#8217;t make it into the recording can be read on the follow-up post, State of the Word Reflections. Josepha Haden Chomphosy kicked off the State of the Word with a reminder on the four freedoms of WordPress, that you are free to run the program, you&#8217;re free to study and change the code, you&#8217;re free to distribute your code and also redistribute WordPress.</p>



<p>She also recorded a separate WP briefing with her reflections in episode 45, State of the Word Reflections in which she highlights, among other things, learn WordPress, that 12,000 students actually went through the courses and the workshops already since the inception. And she also highlighted the WordPress Playground, which is a tool to run WordPress in the browser. You don&#8217;t need a server, you don&#8217;t need a database. You can run it in the browser and test plugins and themes. I think that changes how we approach some of the discovery for WordPress. We talked about it on the show here as well, but it&#8217;s definitely something that will have so many ramifications in the WordPress space later on when it&#8217;s still very raw and very not production ready. It&#8217;s just an idea that has already a proof of concept. And then the recap posts from the community are linked in the Gutenberg Weekend Edition 239 from December 17th, and you can check it out from there.</p>



<p>I also have a side note that the Pew Research Center received a shoutout for the politology quiz that they built with blocks and had one million people already taking it. Seth Rubenstein is the lead developer and was a guest on a Gutenberg Times Live Q&amp;A last year. And he gave a great demonstration about their team&#8217;s work with the block editor, so as they went for the Gutenberg first approach building the website. The recording is available on the Gutenberg Times YouTube channel, and also we have a post here on the Gutenberg Times website as well. So as always, all these links are in the show notes of the 78th episode. So Hector, do you have any comments on this? What is your most exciting topic from the State of the Word? You had a few takeaways?</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Yeah, there were a handful of them. I would actually highlight everything, starting with WordPress Playground. It&#8217;s such amazing technology and it&#8217;s going to open so many doors. But if I had to pick something, maybe for me because it is the thing I&#8217;m the closest to, it was a great recap about the progress WordPress made in the site editing front during the last year, to the point nowadays we can create themes directly in the editor just with blocks and patterns. This brings us very close to wrapping phase two and starting exploration around phase three in 2023. So it&#8217;s great to see that all these progress.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, you&#8217;re right, you&#8217;re right. And it&#8217;s been such a long journey as well. I look back at some of the history on the Gutenberg Times and the Gutenberg podcasts, and we first started talking about full-site editing in January of 2020. That was even pre-pandemic, and we had quite a few developers on our live Q&amp;A talking about the first concepts about that. So now, three years later, it&#8217;s almost finished and it&#8217;s really cool. There are still some things to be done, but I am really excited about the start of phase three of collaboration and I have been constantly trying to unify all the various tools and methods and interfaces to streamline my workflow to produce content for the web. And if I don&#8217;t have to use multiple tools to collaborate with people, I will have arrived on internet nirvana. Yeah, it&#8217;s a high calling of course, but yeah, we are all in a space where we could maybe make it happen. So I&#8217;m really excited about that.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Yeah. Also, it&#8217;s worth noting that even when we move to phase three and we can call a wrap on phase two, phase two will not be fully finished because there&#8217;s always going to be things to do related to site editing improvements, new tools. So I can see contributors working in new features for phase three and also iterating on phase two items. Another big takeaway for me during State of the Word was seeing how much Gutenberg itself has matured. And it&#8217;s now been used in more projects such as Tumblr, bbPress, and even in some mobile apps like Day One. Also, let&#8217;s not forget how WordCamps have made a comeback after COVID hit and stopped all the in-person events. And we went from one single WordCamp in 2021 to up to 22 in the last year, in 2022. That&#8217;s amazing.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a nice iteration of the numbers. 22 WordCamps in &#8217;22.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Exactly. Especially since the community is what makes WordPress what it is, it&#8217;s the most important part of WordPress. So that&#8217;s really good to see.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely. Having the first WordPress in-person event in WordCamp Europe, I realized how much I missed interacting with everybody else in the community and seeing new faces and interacting with old friends. I looked up the number of WordCamps that were done in 2019, in-person WordCamps, and there were 148, or 145, something like that. So there is quite a bit of time to go between 22 to 142 or something like that.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s coming back especially because all those WordPress meetups, the local meetups, are all coming back as well. I think there was a note in the State of the Word that out of the 500, 260 have already come back to in-person events. And we know that WordPress meetups are actually the prerequisite to actually have local WordCamp organizers together to organize a WordCamp. So yeah, it&#8217;s all coming back and I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s coming back because of the connection that you have in the community. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: As I mentioned earlier, I came to the contributing space in 2020. It was during the pandemic, so actually my first WordCamp was the only WordCamp in 2021. And my second WordCamp was for computer ware in last year. So it was really nice and refreshing for me to meet all the other contributors. It is something special, for sure.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Absolutely, yeah. It was great to meet you, Hector, although we had so many meetings with people on Zoom. Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Fun times.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Well, circling back to State of the Word, I would also like to point out that, last but not least, it&#8217;s really cool to see how Openverse has grown since joined WordPress about a year and a half ago. And I&#8217;m super excited to see that coming, Openverse integration in WordPress that will allow users to directly search and add images from Openverse into their WordPress site without leaving the editor at all. That&#8217;s super cool.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s super cool. And I think it would also be really cool to have that also go back to if somebody uploads an image to WordPress and checks the check mark, also put it into Openverse. I think that part would really make it to a 360 kind of integration. I also love that there&#8217;s not only for images, but there is a lot of audio already uploaded to the Openverse that you can use on podcasts or on videos, and add free without having to think about royalties and buying for it and all that. Yeah, so free to the community.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: There&#8217;s so many possibilities there. The future is exciting.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really exciting. And I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s all happening in conjunction with WordPress. The same with the WordPress photos library, where people can just upload their photos and have it be it in the public domain and make it available to the broader community. It&#8217;s really cool.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Yeah.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>WordPress 6.2</strong></h3>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. So between Christmas and New Year&#8217;s, Hector, you published the release schedule proposal for 6.2. I think it was something we were all waiting for. Kind of, okay, how do we plan first quarter when we don&#8217;t know when the release is coming? So you provided. So if the release team concurs, what&#8217;s the plan? When will we see the first Beta?</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: If the proposed plan is approved, the first Beta release will be on February 7th, which is 10 days before the first of our WordCamp Asia takes place.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. In the planning schedule, you also have a call for contributors to volunteer for the release squad. So if you, dear listeners, are inclined to take part in it and you already have a little experience in contributing, throw your hat in the ring by commenting on the release post on the scheduled proposal post. And also throw your hat in the ring also means for those who English is their second language, also means raise your hand, you want to volunteer to be part of it, and then the release team is coming together. When do you expect that you will have a final plan?</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: The call for volunteers is open as we speak. Considering the end of the year vacation people are taking, contributors taking, I think we won&#8217;t have anything until end of next week or the following one. We&#8217;re leaving some extra time for people to come back from the holidays and chime in.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Okay. Yeah, so there are only two more Gutenberg releases before the feature freeze, if I calculate that correctly. We better get started in reviewing all the great new features that are coming in, in a more consolidated way.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Definitely. I encourage all of our listeners to start testing and giving feedback. It&#8217;s always super helpful. Also, compared to the past releases, the proposed 6.2 schedule both include a fourth Beta release compared to the previous three ones to leave some extra buffer time between WordCamp Asia and release candidate one, which will be on March 7th for a final release on March 28th.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, okay. Yeah, so contributor day at WordCamp Asia is definitely going to be part of it and that is really cool to have. Maybe we need to organize some tables that do some testing there. I don&#8217;t know how far the work of Asia contributor day team is about that, but having that plan definitely gives us all focus on that contributor day. All right, cool. So to repeat that, final release could be March 28th, so that&#8217;s about three months from today. And we will have a 6.2 release, provided everything works out as we anticipate now.</p>



<p>And I have a reminder for our listeners now for next week. The Gutenberg Times Live Q&amp;A, Layout, Layout Layout will be happening on January 11th at 5:00 PM Eastern. That&#8217;s 22:00 UTC. And in this show, Isabel Brison, Andrew Serong, Justin Tadlock and I will discuss the opportunities and challenges for all the layout features for site builders. And we will be available for questions and answer them.</p>



<p>And Isabel Brison will also give us a demo of the various layout scenarios to use. She has, with Andrew, been instrumental in building all the features into the site editor and the blocks, and it&#8217;s going to be a very interesting show. It&#8217;s also going to be a little preview on Isabel Brison&#8217;s talk at WordCamp Asia in February 2023. So join us, link us in the show notes, and don&#8217;t forget you need to register there and to be&#8230; We will have a recording, of course, with the show notes and as well as a transcript, but it&#8217;s always good to have your questions answered live by the experts on the panel, and we have some great experts there.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s Released</strong></h3>



<p>So, that brings us to the latest Gutenberg releases. First, there&#8217;s Gutenberg 14.8. That was released in December 12th. Ryan Welcher was release lead and it had 167 PRs merged by 42 contributors, five of which were first contributors. So welcome to the project, first contributors. So Hector, what&#8217;s the most significant enhancement in this release?</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Well, Gutenberg 14.8, so several changes to the site editor user interface, and introduce something I&#8217;m super excited about, which is browse mode. Thanks to this first iteration of browse mode, users can switch between editing and browsing modes in the site editor, making it much easier to navigate through templates and template parts or even add new ones through the sidebar. It&#8217;s a feature that has been long awaited and it&#8217;s finally here and I&#8217;m super excited.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And it helps you with where you land when you click on the site editor. You are now not landing into editing your homepage and so now you have a better entrance into the site editor. And I really like that because it gets you better settled into what you&#8217;re going to do.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: It makes for a nicer onboarding and it&#8217;s less dangerous, let&#8217;s say, because it&#8217;s much more difficult to break your design just as soon as you land on the site editor.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, totally. So the navigation block also had some enhancements, especially with the migration from the old menu. So if you have a location primary, it will now fall back to the navigation menu from the classic menu. That is really helpful on the transition. There are other fallback updates made that it also uses the most recently created menu from the classic theme when you start migrating to a block theme.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>



<p>So that is definitely a good help for transitioning from a classic theme to a block theme. But also it kind of decreases the mental load that you don&#8217;t have to recreate all your menus when you switch out the theme, which is something that was sometimes really critical in the classic menu, in the classic theme space, where everybody had different menu locations. And so I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s completely solved yet, but this is definitely a first step.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Yes, it&#8217;s a step on the right direction. We all know building menus is one of the most challenging aspects of building your site. And contributors are making a huge step for making the menu building process much easier.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. There&#8217;s also one that came with 14.8 that is for the query block. The parent block is they removed the color block support just because it was always clashing up against the other blocks that are in the query block for the post template for the title and the excerpt. You could kind of get lost in which color did we do, and where do we do that? So removing it from the wrapper query block is definitely a good choice because it removes some of that confusion of where colors are actually set.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Exactly. Contributors have seen a few inconsistencies when adding the color to the wrapper query block, between the title, between the navigation links. So now the colors block supports are all in the inner blocks and there&#8217;s no space for confusion.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So what else do we see there? Yeah, I think that was it on the 14.8 release, on the highlights. There are certainly the sidebar tabs for the navigation blocks. There is great work on the experimentation that happened. So right now we have five areas of experimentation in the Gutenberg plugin and there is only two more freeze, two more releases to get them out of experimentation into the production of the Gutenberg plugin. One of them is the sidebar for the navigation block. The other one is the separated settings tab in the sidebar that separates the styles from the features. And then the others, I don&#8217;t recall right now. Hang on, I&#8217;m going to check them out. I just had it there and then I closed my browser because, I don&#8217;t know, sometimes I just randomly close browser tabs, which is a really good way to confuse myself.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: The type interface is making good progress and it&#8217;s something we would likely see out of experimental very soon.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah. And then is the global styles for custom CSS is actually in&#8230; We all wait for that, but it&#8217;s now in the experimental stage and need to be switched on through experiments menu item on the Gutenberg plugin. And then the other one is the color randomizer utility that lets you mix the current color palette randomly and change it out. That&#8217;s kind of a funky way of handling your website to do a randomized color palette, but it certainly is a proof of concept of something bigger. Was there anything else in the 14.8 you want to mention, Hector?</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Well, there are a few other main highlights that you might have seen, our listeners might have seen in the release post. One of them is super interesting, which is the custom CSS rules for your site. There&#8217;s now a tiny CSS text field where you can add your custom CSS directly in the editor. As we all know, with great power comes responsibility. So it&#8217;s nice that you can add a custom CSS directly in the editor, but let&#8217;s not overuse the important.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s definitely a way to&#8230; But that was before, so site editors or site users or site owners who used the custom CSS piece found that that was the missing piece to actually sign on to the full site editing, because they couldn&#8217;t do those very fast changes like changing a font size somewhere or changing a space somewhere or change the color of a border very easily by just using the developer tools, identifying the marker, the selector, and then just change the color in a custom CSS. Yeah, it opens up the capabilities for that.</p>



<p>You need definitely have file editing capabilities on the server and that sometimes was not available to anybody. But those who used it, they really missed it in the file site editing, in the site editing features, so that is really a good thing. And there is also a&#8230; It&#8217;s not yet released and it&#8217;s not merged yet in, but I know that Carolina Nymark is actually working on custom CSS for single blocks. And I think that&#8217;s also a good way to, in the paradigm of getting atomic design going, that that&#8217;s probably a better approach than having custom CSS being pulled in for every site page or page with the custom CSS. Rather do it per block.</p>



<p>Either way, it&#8217;s kind of a interesting feature that people want to have some control or at least go back to that what they are used to do and figure out how they can change it. Well, that definitely was a changelog of 14.8. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve forgotten anything. I think we, in the release post by Ryan, it was a reorganized&#8230;. Oh, the style book is definitely something that was in 4.8. We haven&#8217;t talked about it. So do you want to talk about it, what that does?</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Oh yeah, definitely. The style book is a super cool new feature, which is extension of the style site editor. The style book in a nutshell gives you an overview of all the available blocks you have in a single place so that you can easily browse all the blocks you have available and play with their design.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: When Gutenberg first came out, there were quite a few initiatives where you could have a unit test for blocks, where I think Rich Tabor actually had a plugin and I also worked with some of our clients back then when that we had a list of all the blocks in a page and then looked at it, how the theme works with it. And that was kind of a block unit testing in design. And with the additional features that come with site editing, it was a hard time to figure out what is a change in color on the paragraph block will have additional ramification throughout the site, or when you change style variations.</p>



<p>So I&#8217;m really glad that the style book, that&#8217;s a menu item in the site editor. You can go there and then see all the blocks that you have. And you get an access to the style variations of your theme so you can select them and then see how the blocks change. And that is so powerful that you don&#8217;t have this save and surprise effect anymore. You really look at it and say, &#8220;Oh yeah, I like it.&#8221; And you also see where the style variations may not be entirely working for your site because there are some things that are left out. So this is so powerful for the experience with the block editor.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: For our listeners to picture it in their mind, it&#8217;s like having a page with demo content with all the blocks. You have it registered either core blocks or third party blocks. So as soon as you install it, applying that provides blocks, all these third party blocks will appear in the style book. And you will be able to see all of them together, play with the global styles, play with the accelerations, and see how they affect all these first party and third party blocks in a single place as if you have demo content page but automatically generated for you.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So it really offsets the need for these block unit testings and it&#8217;s very, very powerful. Yeah, I so agree. I think we&#8217;ve got it all now. Let&#8217;s move on to the next release, which was 14.9. And it has at the time of this recording not been released, but it will come out any hour now. For those who use the Gutenberg plugin on their sites, it&#8217;s the first Gutenberg release for 2023. 132 PRs by 46 contributors. Again, five new contributors in there. Congrats for your merge of your PR, and welcome to the project. Thank you so much for your contributions, for all of them.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: It&#8217;s refreshing to see all these new contributors, even in these more maintenance oriented releases that happen during holidays. So congratulations to you all, and welcome.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: What are the highlights? What did you see, or what&#8217;s in the release?</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: There are a few changes. They&#8217;re mostly iterative, building on top of past features and enhancements. One of them, one very cool, is a new push to global styles button that appears in the cyber blocks, which allows users to, once they edit the blocks&#8217; style and they like it and they say, &#8220;Hey, I like this how this is looking or how this image is looking. I would like all my image blocks to look like this.&#8221; It allows them to push those styles to global styles so that they automatically affect all the blocks of that type.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. And that&#8217;s also why it&#8217;s good to have this style book handy so you can actually see if you made a mistake or something like that and said, &#8220;Oh no, I didn&#8217;t consider this, so let&#8217;s do one more time.&#8221; Yeah. So that&#8217;s a great feature. Yeah, absolutely.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Also, for those who like building patterns, now when registering patterns, there&#8217;s a new property that allows you to specify in which template a pattern makes sense. Let&#8217;s suppose, for example, we are building a 404 pattern. Previously it would be released everywhere, so it would appear everywhere in all kinds of templates. Now you can limit it to only appear on a 404 template, so it doesn&#8217;t bring noise to other templates where it doesn&#8217;t make sense. So this is going to improve pattern discoverability in general as patterns.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And it also improves separation of concerns. As you said, it will not show up on every page where even if it&#8217;s not suitable for the pattern. But it also themes can then, or plugin can now create custom post types and that all, and just make those patterns available for certain custom post types. I think that is definitely a missing piece that has now been added to it. Excellent. Yeah, I&#8217;m really excited about that.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Yes, there&#8217;s a minor update following up on Gutenberg 14.5. So we are thinking, we&#8217;re looking at two months ago, three months ago, when the list view and the document outline were merged in a single panel. We have seen there are a few improvements that can be made in the design. So now, for example, the word count has been moved to the top of the outline for more clarity.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, there was some confusion. Where is it now? Yeah. And then you didn&#8217;t see it at first because when you hit on update, you post and then the little notification ball totally covered that piece. So it took a while till that goes away so you see the word count and the time to read and also the block count. There were a few pieces missing. I don&#8217;t know why they&#8217;re missing, but they probably don&#8217;t seem to be very important for content creators to see. And the outline, having the other one on the list here in one it definitely makes sense to have that.</p>



<p>So if you haven&#8217;t seen that yet, it was in Gutenberg 14.5. It will come to 6.2, so checking it out through the Gutenberg plugin is definitely worth trying, worth a look so your site owners or the clients are prepared to find it in a different space. What I&#8217;m also very excited about is that there is now an option to import widgets from the sidebars into template parts. And that is in the whole idea of transitioning from a classic theme to block themes or make a site be better prepared to move to a site, to full site editing block theme. This is definitely a step forward. Any additional thoughts on that?</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Oh yeah, absolutely. This is a very important milestone towards block adoption because it allows users to migrate from classic widgets to native blocks. It&#8217;s worth noting that it doesn&#8217;t work on template focus mode yet, it&#8217;s only available for the block inspector. But this is definitely a step on the right direction to increase block adoption.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent, yeah. And George Mamadashvili, who heads&#8230; That&#8217;s his PR. He also has a nice video on how he demonstrates how it&#8217;s going to work. So I hear quite a few people celebrating this piece to make the transition over. Another one is, this is minor thing, but the configurable settings for the fluid typography in the theme JSONs now has a minimum font size, so it can be anchored on the smallest font size. So the fluidity then can increase the font size on a bigger screen. There was a hard coded value of 14 pixels before, with no way to change. And now you can have the minimum font size, like 16 pixels or 18 pixels depending on your site needs. That&#8217;s a minor thing, but I think it is something that quite a few designers were missing.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Yes, absolutely. It&#8217;s a minor improvement, but we&#8217;ve seen lots of these minor improvements in the last, I don&#8217;t know, four or five Gutenberg releases building on top of free typography. And when you look at them altogether combined, you can see huge improvements on how the feature is becoming more and more powerful by the day.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. I think that was at 14 point&#8230; No, one thing is still really important from the release and that is the adding shadow presets support for the theme JSON. So you can do box shadows on your blocks or wrapper blocks, and that is now available for designers of themes. There is no user interface for that yet. But as we said repeatedly here on the podcast, things will be…</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: It will come.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Hmm?</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: It will come.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But it&#8217;s important to make it work for the theme developers first. Before you have all the added implementation for site owners that want to change it, you first need to know how it&#8217;s actually working so you can see where the pieces are that need to be surfaced in a user interface. So there is a new setting object called shadow, and then you can add different palettes to it for natural and crisp and sharp and soft shadows. And the PR has quite a few information about how that&#8217;s implemented. It gives you quite a few use cases on how you can do the shadow boxes for the buttons, for cover block, for menu block. If you have a sticky menu, then you can put a little shadow underneath it to see the difference between the page and the menu. So there are quite a few design use cases to try that out.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: I&#8217;m curious to see what designers come up with thanks to this new setting. I can see lots of 3D buttons and shadow buttons and all these cool things.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You could even do the outlines of the shadows, kind of, if you have an outline&#8230; Yeah, there are some great designs out there right now. So, from the changelog we are on, anything else that you wanted to talk about here that we missed? I know that Tonya Mark has updated the tracking issue for the web fonts API. And what&#8217;s merged in this release is the change of architecture to use the Core&#8217;s dependencies API with the web fonts API. And there&#8217;s a call for testing out there, or it will be out there, and making sure that how you use it. She has an update where she asked how you can help. And that is if you have an idea about naming the API, should it be webfonts, or web fonts, two words, or just the fonts API, which I tend to be the fonts API, but there is a renaming before everything gets into the Core that we&#8217;ll be name things right.</p>



<p>And then the other one is a call to test the new architecture and share feedback on your testing reports and using the web fonts API. I&#8217;m not quite sure how the planning is because it seems to be still blocked furthermore through additional architectural work. Hector, do you think that that will come with 6.2, or is it now a little late for 6.2?</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Well, Tony and the other contributors are making their best to have this feature land in 6.2, so I&#8217;m pretty positive it can make it in 6.2. And the best way to ensure it can land in that version is to help with testing and with feedback. That will help unlock the architecture redesign and the renaming and everything that&#8217;s currently being discussed right now.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Okay. Yeah, if you all are contributing to things, dear listeners, help getting that over the finish line. It definitely needs some testing. So I think that&#8217;s the end of talking about Gutenberg 14.9. We&#8217;re coming also up on the hour, so I think we can go to closing things. Are there anything that you want to point out that are on the roadmap for 6.2 that you want to have our listeners know? And if not, how can the listeners get in contact with you, where to best meet you online?</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Well, you can reach out to me in WordPress Slack. Handle is Prieto. I guess it will be written in the show notes. So please feel free to ping me there or in GitHub or in Track. I&#8217;m using the handle everywhere, so that&#8217;s easy. I would just like to circle back to the 6.2 planning and reminding everyone the call for volunteers is open. So if you&#8217;re interested in participating in the squad, you are more than welcome. We will assist you if it&#8217;s your first time. If you&#8217;re an assistant contributor, you are also welcome and we can learn from you. So everybody&#8217;s welcome, that&#8217;s the long story short.</p>



<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And the only thing that I want to remind you is about the next week&#8217;s Gutenberg Live Q&amp;A with Isabel Brison, Andrew Serong and Justin Tadlock on Layout, Layout, Layout. January 11th at 5:00 PM Eastern and 20:22 UTC. That&#8217;s 10:00 PM on UTC. And as always, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is episode 78. And if you have questions and suggestions or news you want us to include, send them to <a href="mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. That&#8217;s <a href="mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. So thank you so much, Hector, for joining me here for the first Changelog podcast in 2023 to spend the time on preparation as well as in the show. Thank you all for listening and goodbye and again, Happy New Year.</p>



<p><em>Hector Prieto</em>: Thank you for having me and see you soon. Happy New Year, everybody.</p>]]></content:encoded>
