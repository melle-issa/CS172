	<title>WPTavern: New WP Speakers Website Helps Event Organizers Find Speakers</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=144261</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/new-wp-speakers-website-helps-event-organizers-find-speakers</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Michelle Frechette, Director of Community Engagement at StellarWP, has launched a new independent project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpspeakers.com/&quot;&gt;WP Speakers&lt;/a&gt; that helps event organizers find available speakers for WordPress meetups, WordCamps, podcasts, and other events. The site offers a database of speakers that is free to join and free to search.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When speakers sign up, they include a bio, headshot, location, languages they speak, topics, expertise, and contact information. They can also specify if they identify being from an underrepresented group. In the short amount of time the site has been live, WP Speakers has added 149 registered speakers who are ready and willing to share their WordPress knowledge at both virtual and in-person events.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;âAs a meetup organizer for my local WordPress meetup, Iâm constantly searching for speakers to present,&amp;#8221; Frechette said. &amp;#8220;On one hand the pandemic made it harder to keep coming up with fresh meetup content, but on the other hand, it allowed me to connect to speakers globally as all of our meetings were moved online. But even with all of the speakers in the world now able to present, it was still hard to think of topics and then source speakers. As well-connected as I am in WordPress, I couldnât even imagine how much more difficult it might be for someone who didnât know a lot of speakers personally. So WP Speakers was born.â&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Frechette has a knack for bringing people together and helping them find their place in WordPress. In addition to her open source contributions, she maintains &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;http://wpcareerpages.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WPCareerPages.com&lt;/a&gt;, a site that connects job seekers with WordPress companies, and publishes a weekly tweet thread with available positions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Frechette is supporting her efforts on the project through sponsorship funds, which allow her to keep the resource free.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;âItâs important to me that the ability to belong on the site as well as be able to search for speakers always remains free,&amp;#8221; she said. &amp;#8220;That way no one is denied from being able to participate. A resource like this should be available to all.â&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Frechette plans to continue adding to the speaker resource page and an event organizer resource page is next on the roadmap. Anyone who wants to be listed on the site can fill out the &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wpspeakers.com/join-as-a-speaker/&quot;&gt;Join As a Speaker&lt;/a&gt;â form and new profiles will be approved in 1-3 business days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Priced Out of API Access: Jetpack and WordPress.com Discontinue Support for Twitter Auto-Sharing</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=144234</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/priced-out-of-api-access-jetpack-and-wordpress-com-discontinue-support-for-twitter-auto-sharing</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Jetpack and WordPress.com &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/04/29/why-twitter-auto-sharing-is-coming-to-an-end/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; they will no longer support the Twitter API in their products. Last month &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/twitter-suspends-wordpress-coms-access-to-twitter-api-breaking-jetpack-social-sharing&quot;&gt;Twitter suspended WordPress.com&amp;#8217;s access to its API&lt;/a&gt;, which broke Jetpack Social Sharing &amp;#8211; the mechanism that auto-tweets published posts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although WordPress.com&amp;#8217;s access to the API was reinstated for a few weeks, the company has now been priced out of offering features that rely on Twitter&amp;#8217;s API:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter recently notified Automattic that it was dramatically changing the terms and pricing of the Twitter API. The cost increase is prohibitive for us to absorb without passing a significant price increase along to you, and we donât see that as an option. We have attempted to negotiate a path forward, but havenât been able to reach an agreement in time for Twitterâs May 1 cutoff.Â &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given that, we have decided to discontinue using the Twitter API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WordPress.com did not detail its estimated API usage, but Enterprise access &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-data-api-prices-out-nearly-everyone/&quot;&gt;starts at $42,000/month&lt;/a&gt; for 50 million tweets and scales upwards based on usage, with 100 million tweets priced at $125,000/month and 200 million priced at $210,000 per month. This astronomical price increase will swiftly cull many applications, institutions, and large scale publishers that don&amp;#8217;t have an extra $500k/year &amp;#8211; $2.5M/year in the budget for Twitter API access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In October 2022, Jetpack &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/jetpack-social-plugin-adds-paid-plan-free-users-now-limited-to-30-shares-per-month&quot;&gt;started monetizing this feature&lt;/a&gt; with a paid plan that limited the free version to 30 social shares per month (to any social network), a controversial decision that sent many users in search of alternatives. Passing the cost to the customer here was already beyond what most users wanted to pay for these features and is not sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WordPress.com will be removing Twitter from Jetpack Social and refocusing its efforts on other social media sharing capabilities. The company is adding Instagram and Mastodon to its auto-sharing lineup soon. Auto-sharing for Tumblr, Facebook, and LinkedIn still works. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Starting, today, users who want to share their published posts on Twitter will need to share the link manually through the Twitter app. For clarification, sharing posts by clicking the Tweet button will continue working. This change only affects auto-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The massive increase in API pricing has competitors fired up to support users migrating away from Twitter. Automattic, which also owns Tumblr, took a stab at Twitter in the conclusion of the announcement: &amp;#8220;If your recent experiences with Twitter have left you dissatisfied,Â &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;go take Tumblr for a spin&lt;/a&gt;Â â we hear itâs quite a party over there.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In February, Mastodon promised that the platform would never charge for API access. After Automattic&amp;#8217;s announcement today, Mastodon &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joinmastodon/status/1652511061352800259&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; they are excited to see the company expanding support for the platform in Jetpack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Many of Twitter's most recognizable features were invented in third-party apps, and we're thrilled to see what those developers are now doing with Mastodon. Powered by open source, we can promise: Mastodon will never charge for API access!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mastodon (@Mastodon@mastodon.social) (@joinmastodon) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joinmastodon/status/1621331792019030016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;February 3, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Twitter may be shooting itself in the foot by making it more costly, in terms of time and automation, to have incoming content from the open web. It&amp;#8217;s becoming more cumbersome for publishers to share their content. This has further aggravated Twitter&amp;#8217;s user base who is used to coming to the platform for up-to-the-minute news. Too many smaller apps are now priced out of providing these kinds of updates. Some users have started &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pianodao/status/1652587846690111488&quot;&gt;encouraging their followers to follow them on other networks&lt;/a&gt; to be alerted when posts are published.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This is an example of the minor annoyances that will ultimately make people look for alternatives to Twitter,&amp;#8221; WordPress.com user @MoviesSilently said. &amp;#8220;Frictionless sharing isn&amp;#8217;t a make or break but it&amp;#8217;s nice.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I guess I need to go fire up my Tumblr account again or make a new one, and possibly see what Mastadon is all about. I'm not getting any reach on Twitter anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; MUDPIX OUTDOORS (@mudpiix) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mudpiix/status/1652436811556306944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 29, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s news has &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/wordpressdotcom/status/1652424620069330946/retweets/with_comments&quot;&gt;added to users&amp;#8217; compounding disappointment&lt;/a&gt; with Twitter. Not only has it is become more costly to have an active voice but advertising has a stranglehold on the feed. As major brands have ceased advertising on the platform, the quality of ads has declined to where scrolling the app has become like wading through a flea market. Twitter users may soon be in for more changes to their feeds as any content originating from WordPress.com or Jetpack-powered sites will require a manual share to be found on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WordPress.org blog: People of WordPress: Monika Rao</title>
	<guid>https://wordpress.org/news/?p=14850</guid>
	<link>https://wordpress.org/news/2023/04/people-of-wordpress-monika-rao/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This month we feature Monika Rao, a Product and Quality Assurance Manager from India. She finds contributing to the WordPress project a way to deepen her technical skills and further her web career.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;People of WordPress&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;series shares inspiring stories of how peopleâs lives can change for the better through WordPress and its global community of contributors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img width=&quot;1014&quot; height=&quot;627&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/feature-img-monika.jpg?resize=1014%2C627&amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Monika Rao at a WordCamp&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14842&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Monika was born in Udaipur, in the state of Rajasthan, India. At that time, she recalls, there was some resistance to girls&amp;#8217; education in certain subjects. Thanks to her parents&amp;#8217; support and encouragement, she graduated in Computer Science Engineering. Following graduation, she went on to work for an international firm. However, she felt she wanted to work in her home area and so returned to work for a firm based in Udaipur itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Monika started her career journey with WordPress in 2015, and was fascinated as she learnt more of the technology. A few years later, she moved into a&amp;nbsp; role as a WordPress Quality Analyst, enabling her to dive further into the software. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;âFrom that moment, I decided to make it an integral part of my ever-learning professional career,â she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The more Monika researched WordPress, the more she found it was not just a tool to simplify website building but also a platform where you could âmeet new people, share your thoughts, learn from them and improve yourself through the process.â&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When she first started working with WordPress, she found she had many questions, ranging from what are themes and plugins to what is a WordCamp. As her knowledge grew, she knew one day she wanted to be able to contribute to both the code and the community supporting it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;Becoming part of WordPress&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Monika started contributing to WordPress in 2015 with Theme Review. In this area, she was able to work alongside WordPress code experts and, at the same time, learn the concepts of theme development. She saw this as a great opportunity to learn and improve her development skills.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was also very interested in testing from the beginning, so she started contributing to Core. Her first contribution was to the WordPress 4.7 release in 2016. She remembers the day she first saw her name in the WordPress contributor list. This encouraged her to make more contributions including to core and the community team, and each time she felt more like part of the community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thus inspired, Monika delved into making the software more easily available in her native Hindi language through joining other contributors to the Polyglots team. She went on to become a General Translation Editor for the Hindi language, and has continued to contribute in this area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img width=&quot;902&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/wp-udaipur-2017.png?resize=902%2C600&amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Monika as part of a panel at WordCamp Udaipur 2017&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14846&quot; /&gt;Monika and other panelists at WordCamp Udaipur 2017



&lt;p&gt;As she became involved with the WordPress community, she looked for ways of sharing it with others in her home city. In 2017 she was part of the organizing team for &lt;a href=&quot;https://udaipur.wordcamp.org/2017&quot;&gt;WordCamp Udaipur 2017&lt;/a&gt; and there shared her contributing journey with others. This was her first WordCamp, and she describes the experience as âsuperbâ. It enabled her to connect to both those new to WordPress and those already working with it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âIt was a great moment for me speaking in front of hundreds of people and everyone cherished my journey. It inspired me to continue my contribution to other teams too.â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Monika Rao&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She went on to be an organizer for &lt;a href=&quot;https://udaipur.wordcamp.org/2018/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Udaipur 2018&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://india.wordcamp.org/2021/&quot;&gt;WordCamp India 2021&lt;/a&gt;. She also contributes to the Meta and Theme review teams. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;Contributing to WordPress software releases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2019 was a big year for Monika. She got married and joined a new firm where she could work more on WordPress, learning about marketing and design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In November 2019, the WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden put out a call for an all-women and non-binary release squad. Monika said: âIâve always felt that not enough women take part in WordPress, so I decided to jump in.â She took on the role of Test Lead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âIt was a wonderful journeyâ worth every second and this was a proud moment for me when I saw my name on the WordPress Noteworthy list. You feel proud when you see your small contributions in use by 40 per cent of the web.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Monika Rao&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;img width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;660&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/monika-5-6.jpg?resize=1024%2C660&amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Some of the notable contributors for the WordPress 5.6 release&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14849&quot; /&gt;Monika was part of the notable contributors for the WordPress 5.6 release



&lt;p&gt;As a Test Lead, her priority was ensuring the release would be stable and, more importantly, ready for production sites. To effectively manage all the testing, test scrubs were run weekly, highlighting the key testing areas to help get the entire team involved. The scrubs also played an important role in picking up tickets needing immediate resolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monika also continued her role in the WordPress 5.7 release, and focused more on the core software. She believes being part of the Core and Test teams is a good way to watch and learn, as well as take part in the different elements that make up a release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âSkills you have will eventually fade away unless you work on them and sharpen them. So donât underestimate the value of any skill. It will eventually help you somehow in your career.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Monika Rao&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added: &amp;#8220;I owe my skills and knowledge to WordPress and its lovely community. The best part about this platform is that it is free and provides ample opportunities to improve your skills and build a career. The wider WordPress community is highly supportive, and it provides numerous additional resources, such as online forums, tutorials, and meetups, to help people learn and grow. With the help of WordPress, anyone can learn how to create websites, develop plugins, and contribute to the community.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This route for learning has helped Monika in choosing the direction of her career and in keeping her skills up-to-date. In October 2021, she joined a company specializing in producing WordPress plugins and services for online businesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;Everyone can contribute to WordPress&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;img width=&quot;675&quot; height=&quot;900&quot; src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/monika-on-holiday2.jpg?resize=675%2C900&amp;ssl=1&quot; alt=&quot;Monika pictured during her travels&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-14845&quot; /&gt;Monika pictured during her travels



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-left&quot;&gt;Monika is determined more people, especially other women, have opportunities to contribute to open source in general. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-left&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;Many people are using WordPress, but they donât all know about contribution. Therefore, my future goal is to help people, especially women, contribute more to WordPress.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Monika Rao&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-left&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;When I first started contributing to WordPress, I thought that being from a testing background, I may not be able to contribute much. However, I soon realized that there are various different areas where I could easily contribute and develop my skills,&amp;#8221; said Monika.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-left&quot;&gt;&amp;#8220;So, I would encourage anyone who is interested in contributing to WordPress to find their own area of interest, regardless of their background, be it marketing, content writing, designing, or any other field. The WordPress community welcomes contributions from people of all backgrounds and skill-sets. So, don&amp;#8217;t hesitate to dive in and contribute in a way that suits your interests and skills.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;Share the stories&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community.&amp;nbsp;Meet more WordPressers in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/&quot;&gt;People of WordPress series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Gutenberg Times: Getting started with block themes, playground, create-block tool and Block Data APIâWeekend Edition #252</title>
	<guid>https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=23980</guid>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy, howdy! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next week, we will head back to to Munich to take over our new apartment and start to explore the new neighborhood on foot.  While getting situated, still provisionally, we will patiently wait until our furniture to arrive from Miami. The weather is starting to get warmer, too. Everything is new. Good times. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also will start migrating the Gutenberg Times website to a block theme, and hopefully can take you along with my lessons learned and some tips to avoid the pitfalls. Maybe. If you already made the switch with one of your sites, email me to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:pauli@gutenbergtimes.com&quot;&gt;pauli@gutenbergtimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.  I really would like to learn more. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before, I can start this next project, I will work on the next Gutenberg plugin release. Stay tuned. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yours, ð&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v15.7.0-rc.1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gutenberg plugin 15.7 release candidate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (RC1) is now available for testing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among other things, you could try out the following new features.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/49992&quot;&gt;new workflow available for the Site Logo block&lt;/a&gt;, to replace the site logo via the sidebar. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/49634&quot;&gt;updated behavior for the Top Toolbar fixed setting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/49958&quot;&gt;a masonry layout on the template pattern suggestion modal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/49838&quot;&gt;New block controls in the site bar for Duotone settings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this month&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Developer Hours&lt;/em&gt;,  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/adamzielin&quot;&gt;Adam ZieliÅski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; will  introduce the new &lt;strong&gt;WordPress Playground&lt;/strong&gt; tool. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It runs WordPress in the browser without the need for PHP, Apache, or MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, &lt;strong&gt;ZieliÅski&lt;/strong&gt;, a member of the development team that created WordPress Playground, will introduce this exciting new implementation and demonstrate it. He will also explain the technologies that make the magic happen, and run through a variety of scenarios and use cases. There will be ample time for Q &amp;amp; A. You can register via Meetup&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/learn-wordpress-online-workshops/events/293196462&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tammy Lister,&lt;/strong&gt; early design lead of Gutenberg, and published the 10 steps on how to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nownextlab.com/2023/04/28/embracing-gutenberg-as-a-product/&quot;&gt;embrace Gutenberg as a product&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Step One she writes:&lt;em&gt; &amp;#8220;One of the biggest questions would be âWhat is Gutenbergâ. I tend to push back around that and say itâs WordPress. The system, the mindset, and the approach have been around for so long now and have been a part of the core development â after all, we are through phase two and starting phase three, Collaboration. So, this is step one to embracing Gutenberg as a product; see it as nothing different from WordPress.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; Curious? There are nine more to go! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jamie Marsland&lt;/strong&gt; has a great video posted on WordPress TV called: &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.tv/2023/04/27/rapid-website-recreation/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Website Recreation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Within this 15-minute demo, he shows you how he rebuilt a photographer&amp;#8217;s website using the Site editor in WordPress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mikemcalister&quot;&gt;Mike McAlister&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has announced the release of his new block theme Ollie and shared details and motivation in &lt;a href=&quot;https://olliewp.com/introducing-the-ollie-wordpress-block-theme/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introducing the Ollie WordPress block theme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  McAlister wrote: &amp;#8220;One of the most powerful features of the Ollie block theme is that it brings together all the new WordPress site building features in a cohesive experience. Site editor,&amp;nbsp;global styles, patterns, templates, template parts&amp;nbsp;â Ollie supports all of these features, and theyâre all beautifully designed and super easy to edit and customize.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Gooding&lt;/strong&gt; gave it a spin and reviewed for the WPTavern: &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/ollie-block-theme-now-in-public-beta&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ollie Block Theme Now in Public Beta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;It is a beautiful, multipurpose theme of the high caliber one might expect from McAlister, a veteran developer whose past products were well known for their minimalist and clean design.&amp;#8221; she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot; id=&quot;2-word-press-6-0-1-and-6-1-scheduled&quot;&gt;Theme Development for Full Site Editing and Blocks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I was asked: &amp;#8220;For new block theme enthusiast, how can they get started?&amp;#8221; I collected a list of starting points: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are three Learn WordPress courses: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.wordpress.org/course/develop-your-first-low-code-block-theme/&quot;&gt;Develop Your First Low-Code Block Theme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you would rather not start from scratch but learn how to change your site with the site editor: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.wordpress.org/course/simple-site-design-with-full-site-editing/&quot;&gt;Part 1: Simple Site Design with Full Site Editing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the Developer blog, Daisy Olsen published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2023/02/block-theme-resources-roundup/&quot;&gt;Block theme resources roundup&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, additional posts became available: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, this section almost became the exclusive &lt;em&gt;Ryan Welcher&amp;#8217;s Corner &lt;/em&gt;for this edition. ð&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@RyanWelcherCodes&quot;&gt;&lt;img /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In his latest post on the WordPress Developer Blog, &lt;strong&gt;Ryan Welcher&lt;/strong&gt; outlined &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2023/04/how-webpack-and-wordpress-packages-interact/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How webpack and WordPress packages interact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You learn more about the connection between @wordpress/scripts and the build process, and why it streamlines that build process for WordPress blocks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nathan Wrigley&lt;/strong&gt; had &lt;strong&gt;Ryan Welcher&lt;/strong&gt; on his WPTavern Jukebox podcast: &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/podcast/73-ryan-welcher-on-using-the-create-block-tool-to-quickly-scaffold-a-new-block-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryan Welcher on Using the create-block Tool to Quickly Scaffold a New Block Plugin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; . They discussed what you can expect from the create-block tool, and the prior knowledge that youâll need to have once the tool has you up and running. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have been using the create block command line tool to spin up a new block projects. It also helps you package your new block into a plugin and test it for the single block plugin repository.  You can also have multiple blocks in one block. You just want to study about the commands, and how they can make your life easier. The documentation pages are available in the block editor handbook: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@wordpress/create-block&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Once yours start using it, you probably would also be interested in creating a custom templates to add to the scaffolding tool. Follow along with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block-tutorial-template/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@wordpress/create-block-tutorial-template&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Periodic Table of WordPress Plugins Showcases 108 Most Popular Plugins</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=144183</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/periodic-table-of-wordpress-plugins-showcases-108-most-popular-plugins</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress core committer Pascal Birchler has published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugintable.com/&quot;&gt;Periodic Table of WordPress Plugins&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate the software&amp;#8217;s upcoming 20th anniversary. The table showcases 108 of the most popular free plugins on WordPress.org.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago Birchler created a website that showed the most popular plugins in a similar table layout, ranking them by number of active installations. This chart has been updated and is now available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugintable.com/&quot;&gt;plugintable.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Today, I am actually &amp;#8216;re-introducing&amp;#8217; this project, complete with a modernized look and feel, more curation, and more useful information than before,&amp;#8221; Birchler said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The website is interactive, so cards can be expanded to see more information about each plugin, including the author, install count, star rating, and the date it was first published.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Approximately 57% of the plugins included have 1 million or more installs, so it gives you a chance to see all of the most successful WordPress.org extensions at a glance. 600k is the lowest number of active installs for plugins included in the chart.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After making the chart, Birchler noted that he was impressed by the stats for the Really Simple SSL plugin, which has more than 5 million active installs and a 5/5-star rating. He also highlighted Site Kit by Google as being the youngest &amp;#8220;element&amp;#8221; first released in October 2019, with 3+ million active installs in just over three years in the directory. The XML Sitemaps Generator plugin is the oldest among those included, released in 2005 just before Akismet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Another plugin that has caught my eye is WP Multibyte Patch by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/eastcoder&quot;&gt;@eastcoder&lt;/a&gt;, which offers improvements for Japanese sites,&amp;#8221; Birchler said. &amp;#8220;With over 1+ million installs it makes me wonder why WordPress core itself doesn&amp;#8217;t have better support for multibyte characters.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you like the Period Table of WordPress Plugins and want to see it hanging on your wall, Birchler has set up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.plugintable.com/&quot;&gt;Shopify-powered store&lt;/a&gt; where you can purchase a high-quality print version. The poster comes in light and dark modes and is also available framed. He plans to donate the proceeds of the store to the WordPress community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<link>https://wptavern.com/big-bite-launches-2023-enterprise-wordpress-survey</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Big Bite, a UK-based enterprise WordPress agency, has launched a new survey called &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigbite.net/state-of-enterprise-WordPress/&quot;&gt;State of Enterprise WordPress&lt;/a&gt; to gather data and insights on how the platform can best serve large-scale brands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey takes approximately 5-7 minutes to complete and covers budgets,&lt;br /&gt;publishing processes, platform strengths, user frustrations, custom functionality, infrastructure, architecture, and ongoing maintenance. It also attempts to gauge whether enterprise users have embraced the block editor and what other CMS&amp;#8217;s the organization is using in addition to WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This particular survey is focused on brands that are using WordPress, in any part of their estate,&amp;#8221; Big Bite CEO Iain McPherson said. &amp;#8220;Maybe it could be a small blog, powering an intranet or a large publishing site. I want to understand why and how they are using WordPress, but then drill down into other valuable metrics such as team size and budgets.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey will be used to create a new report that summarizes the findings from enterprise organizations. McPherson said if the report is well received in the WordPress community, his team may continue publishing the State of Enterprise WordPress on an annual basis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey most directly applies to the people who are responsible for the enterprise organization&amp;#8217;s website, as opposed to the business owners. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We find with companies of these sizes; multiple people are managing their WordPress products,&amp;#8221; McPherson said. &amp;#8220;Also, multiple respondents from the same company is totally OK, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This is one of a couple of initiatives I am working on to raise the brand awareness of Big Bite, but more importantly, show that WordPress should be considered as an enterprise CMS.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to W3Techs, WordPress&amp;#8217; current CMS market share is at &lt;a href=&quot;https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress&quot;&gt;63.3%&lt;/a&gt; of all the websites where a CMS can be detected. Enterprise organizations help keep this market growing, so insights about how they are using WordPress and their particular pain points could be helpful in developing solutions that benefit this segment. Data from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bigbite.net/state-of-enterprise-wordpress/&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; will be aggregated and anonymized and will not be attributed to the respondent or the organization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Human Made to Host AI for WordPress Event on May 25, 2023</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=144137</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/human-made-to-host-ai-for-wordpress-event-may-25-2023</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Human Made is organizing the community&amp;#8217;s first ever &lt;a href=&quot;https://hello.humanmade.com/word-on-the-future-ai-for-wordpress&quot;&gt;AI for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; online conference on May 25, 2023. The time and schedule have not yet been announced but registration is open.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attendees can expect to see demos of Human Made&amp;#8217;s current AI projects and highlights of what others are doing in the space. The organizers plan to discuss the impact AI will have on the WordPress industry and share predictions and insights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Human Made is among a few WordPress product makers that have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/wordpress-developers-are-experimenting-with-gutenberg-native-ai-block-and-content-assistants&quot;&gt;experimenting with Gutenberg-native AI block and content assistants&lt;/a&gt;. CTO Joe Hoyle published several videos demonstrating how prompts can work across various blocks with AI natively integrated into the block editor. His prototypes have &lt;a href=&quot;https://humanmade.com/2023/04/17/progress-on-generative-content-and-blocks-wordpress-ai-pt-2/&quot;&gt;progressed&lt;/a&gt; with the addition of Content Streaming that renders content, blocks, and layout in real time. Users can also cancel the streaming output while it&amp;#8217;s in progress to refine the guidance given to the AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We've made some progress on the WordPress Gutenberg AI integration. Specifically: Content Streaming&amp;#8211; blocks are now rendered as they come in to provide more immediate feedback and guidance. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/D8lw5lBIun&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/D8lw5lBIun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Joe Hoyle (@joe_hoyle) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joe_hoyle/status/1647880352327774210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 17, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency has gone all in on exploring the possibilities AI opens up for this industry and has created a guide titled &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hello.humanmade.com/76-ways-ai-could-transform-wordpress&quot;&gt;76 ways AI could transform WordPress&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8221;Â The document covers content, marketing, publishing, engineering, delivery, and impact in the enterprise. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virtual AI for WordPress event will feature industry leaders who are also creating things in this space. WPfront.page is &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpfront.page/list/ai-plugins/&quot;&gt;tracking&lt;/a&gt; more than three dozen AI products that have popped up in the last few months, so there is no shortage of developers experimenting. Organizers will announce more speakers and sessions ahead of the event on May 25.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Takeaways:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul type=&quot;video&quot; class=&quot;wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outsourcing Infrastructure. &lt;/strong&gt;WordPress hosting companies can benefit from outsourcing their infrastructure to specialized providers such as WP Cloud. This can free up their customer support team from dealing with infrastructure-related issues and enable them to focus on providing better customer service and value-added services.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase Customer Satisfaction.&lt;/strong&gt; By democratizing publishing and providing a superior WordPress experience, hosting companies can reduce churn and retain customers who may otherwise switch to other platforms if their WordPress experience is subpar.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Up for Speed.&lt;/strong&gt; While many factors can impact website speed, some of the most important ones include optimizing images, using a content delivery network (CDN), and minimizing the use of plugins. By focusing on these areas, WordPress agencies can help their clients improve their website speed and ultimately provide a better user experience for their visitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper&quot; id=&quot;h-transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; [00:00:00] hey everybody. Welcome back to Post Status Draft. This is part of our agency series, and I&amp;#8217;m talking to a longtime friend and an awesome agency owner in the space, Kimberly Lepar of Valet Fame. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re gonna be talking about, um, The role in the changing value of websites to organizations. Um, Vale&amp;#8217;s been around so long and has so much experience and just diving into that with Kimberly is gonna be really, really exciting for me because updating her knowledge for how websites and their role, uh, in the world and businesses and organizations, she&amp;#8217;s got a front seat view to that with her team, what they do for their clients. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#8217;re gonna talk about, um, some of those elements that, um, an organization should. Outsource stick to their core competency and outsource. But before we get all of that, we&amp;#8217;re gonna have a fun conversation talking about where websites sit today in the market, on the internet, their value and role, and no better person to talk about that than Kimberly. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So Kimberly, would you mind sharing a little bit about [00:01:00] yourself and what you do at ballet?&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, absolutely. First of all, thanks for having me. It&amp;#8217;s always a pleasure. I . Love hanging out and having conversations like this. I think they&amp;#8217;re so important. Um, and I am the owner of valet.io. We offer comprehensive end-to-end website management services for businesses that wanna have a strong brand presence, um, want to make sure they&amp;#8217;re communicating themselves well online and need a team to support them so that they can focus on the things that they do best every day. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Gosh, you&amp;#8217;re awesome. I, I&amp;#8217;m gonna come back to the end to end because I think that&amp;#8217;s one of the compelling parts of this conversation too. All that you do health. And then having a, a firm, an agency, a partner really that can do so much for the website. Um, but Okay, let&amp;#8217;s dive in. So we&amp;#8217;ve been talking about this for a couple of months now, but I saw you posted on LinkedIn and I&amp;#8217;ll put those in the show notes. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That post, I think it was so timely and so [00:02:00] good. I&amp;#8217;ve been kind of updating my view about all this. Mm-hmm. And you know, in the old days, Websites for these, like, and I find myself still referring to him like they&amp;#8217;re, they&amp;#8217;re a brochure at the base. Mm-hmm. A 24 7, 365 days, a, a year where your clients can go in and kind of check out what you do, but your post really illuminated something that&amp;#8217;s all evolved and changed as the world has changed and business. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, um, what are you seeing there? Um, with the changing value and importance and focus on websites for business and organizations that you serve.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, I think namely the, the chief change is that Gone is the, uh, my business at webmaster email address, uh, that used to be, uh, the sole, uh, provider and contact point for what websites were for a lot of companies. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Uh, they were kind of these closed off boxes where only, you know, two people could edit the HTML and, [00:03:00] and change things up. So, um, from that, And you say the olden days, which it feels like that, but I think maybe even just in the past, I don&amp;#8217;t know, probably five, five years or so, it, it&amp;#8217;s escalated very quickly to become, uh, that the website is important to the CEO, uh, for one reason or another, probably more for. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, brand identity so that, you know, how are we putting our best space forward, right? These, uh, very broad, uh, strokes of what the business means. Uh, it&amp;#8217;s important to marketing, uh, to make sure that they are communicating the services effectively, that there&amp;#8217;s good copy, good, uh, interaction, uh, social integrations, right? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also important to, uh, sales managers and even, um, other line level employees. Um, and other parts of the business to be able to share what they&amp;#8217;re doing or provide. PDFs, white papers, all kinds of registrations. I mean, all those [00:04:00] different things. So it&amp;#8217;s become a very, uh, Uh, crowdsourced, um, important piece of, of a business. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so that&amp;#8217;s changed a lot. It&amp;#8217;s no longer one person kind of holding the keys that can understand. It&amp;#8217;s now really commonplace for everybody in a business to, to think of the website in a different way with a different sort of use for the role that they play.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the things that strikes me from what you&amp;#8217;re saying in our discussions in the past, particularly with your, your clients and what you see is this, when you said webmaster, it&amp;#8217;s this thought of a supplemental thing, like an a, almost an afterthought that websites were once mm-hmm. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thought of now to be in very integral to everything the business and organization does. Um, I remember talking with some of your, About some of your clients that you all work with and, and you, you had an interesting way to say it. You&amp;#8217;re like, maybe they weren&amp;#8217;t straight on e-commerce, so at Ithe or post status for [00:05:00] instance. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, you know, that was, that was it like, yeah. If, if the website&amp;#8217;s down we&amp;#8217;re not making money, you know? Mm-hmm. But you&amp;#8217;re seeing a multifaceted, uh, approach now where it&amp;#8217;s not just an afterthought and supplemental, it&amp;#8217;s really key to driving the mission and goals of the organization. And I thought that was really interesting and awesome for WordPress, by the way. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mm-hmm. And the internet that. Seeing that value change, I wonder if some of that got spur on with pandemic. You know, I&amp;#8217;ve heard a lot of, let&amp;#8217;s say a yo yoga studio or those in-person physical location, bricks and mortar businesses go, yeah, what do we do now? Well, I loved if there&amp;#8217;s positives that came outta covid. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was the fact that it pushed people to go. That&amp;#8217;s not our only means of business. But can you talk a little bit and share what you see from client perspective about the role of websites in these organizations?&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely. Absolutely. I think I have two, um, two very specific examples. I think, uh, [00:06:00] from very different sides of the coin, um, that kind of point out some of the changes that we&amp;#8217;re seeing. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, working on a project with a client who, uh, is trying to consolidate, um, a few different brands, uh, under an umbrella into one, um, during the meetings throughout this project. We can hear the different. Stakeholders in the project, throughout the company, um, really communicating what&amp;#8217;s important to them. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And this kind of goes back to what each person in the web, in the business thinks the website should do. Right. Um, you know, the CEO is is much more concerned about. The, the layout, how things are presented. Uh, you have marketing and other, um, sub-departments of, of that worried about, well, it&amp;#8217;s, is it flashy enough? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, where&amp;#8217;s the, where&amp;#8217;s the pizazz? And then you have, um, someone else who. Has submitted copy and then it gets pulled a week later because no one [00:07:00] within the confines of the project had really taken the time to dig deep into what those words were. So that actually became kind of an afterthought, but then it bumped up in priority. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So you have all of these different things that should matter. But there&amp;#8217;s no, uh, kind of cohesive brain on, uh mm-hmm. When and where they matter, right. Uh, because this kind of traditional business roles, right? So I think even, even business itself is kind of catching up to how it feels about what its website is and what it does. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, alternatively, um, outside of the web presence, businesses that traditionally take place, With more, uh, one-on-one, um, interactions. I have, um, a, a dear friend who I spoke with a couple weeks ago who works in oil field sales and they typically do their, their sales and marketing person to person, right? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s, let&amp;#8217;s, let&amp;#8217;s go on a fishing charter, let&amp;#8217;s go have lunch and all these things. And I. They are, they&amp;#8217;re not leveraging their website well enough to actually say, Hey, we now do these four [00:08:00] other things, uh, that we haven&amp;#8217;t, you know, we only tell people in, in person to person meetings, uh, and the CEO says, you know, oh, well, yeah, we have one. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s fine enough. But is is person to person, um, enough nowadays, are they gonna go to lunch with you and then go check out your website? Right? Do you offer a brochure of services, um, within that and explain what it is that you do? So, um, I think it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s such a widely used normal tool now to just go to someone&amp;#8217;s url, um, that from, from online focused. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Primary businesses and person to person, um, based, you know, formally traditional, right? Brick and mortar or service, service style companies, even in large industries, you know, million dollar year industries like oilfield. Um, it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s changing. It has to. It&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s, yeah. I think I lost the thread there a little, but&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; No. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And why not? Why not [00:09:00] utilize this amazing technology, for instance? So, you know, you can use WordPress to build a website, but then the advent of Google and the search engines that push traffic, people are looking for destinations to find problem, you know, answers to their. Challenges. And so the advent of marketing and understanding with SEO and paid traffic and things like that, back to a site where you could convert it, measure it. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Even, yeah, even on the back end. And that was one of the things that I talked about, uh, with my friend. They don&amp;#8217;t have a A A CRM of, of much of any kind. It just kind of lives in these guys&amp;#8217; heads that go out to these travel routes. You know, we always live on this hit by a bus scenario mm-hmm. Of what happens if I get hit by a bus tomorrow? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What is my team, you know, gonna do what have, what have I laid for information and documentation and. You know, formally, uh, businesses that have been person to person are, are missing an opportunity to kind of move into that digital age of, of finding [00:10:00] clients and putting them on a journey or, um, even, even if it&amp;#8217;s just a, a consideration of the journey you wanna put people on outside of the web experience. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right? It&amp;#8217;s all, it&amp;#8217;s a, it&amp;#8217;s a good. Um, what am I thinking of? Mind mapping? Mm-hmm. Um, I guess of, of how you want all that to work. So from, from the backend, from the actual interfacing with the customer to the front end to how the customer sees you. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of that in between, but it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s now all being laid on the, on the website. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the website&amp;#8217;s job and that&amp;#8217;s, there&amp;#8217;s, that&amp;#8217;s a lot. There&amp;#8217;s a lot going on.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, you mentioned two, two kind of groups. It&amp;#8217;s either marketing managers that I assume could have different title, but somebody that manages the marketing, seeing the value of websites for marketing their business. Uh, and then you also mentioned CEOs. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So that to me just instantly says, Importance, like recognizing the importance that a website can do all these functions. Add [00:11:00] to not just supplement, supplement, but be very complimentary and strengthen cells. You know, if you&amp;#8217;re in B2B cells, I have a friend, I think we, you and I have talked about as a manufacturing company, sells all over the world. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, the search results for those are probably very small, but they&amp;#8217;re long tail and very easily capturable. You know, like, yep. Um, they&amp;#8217;re, somebody&amp;#8217;s going online to find that part or that. Particular, you spell those compressors, but you know, and then so like you could grow your bottom line or your top line really easily, just with some simple things with a WordPress website. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. And then like you said, for those b2b, it&amp;#8217;s, there&amp;#8217;s so many things. Support is another bucket of things. I think of a website is like, I can&amp;#8217;t remember who I&amp;#8217;m supposed to call for this. Or I need to ask a question, go to the website right there. Mm-hmm.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; So I think that&amp;#8217;s good. Very good. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In terms of the industry, in terms of the [00:12:00] internet, of course, we love the open web post status and you did too of la um, through WordPress. So that&amp;#8217;s, that&amp;#8217;s good seeing that value, knowing it has such utility for the overall growth and seeing the mm-hmm. Importance of that. And then, um, but this is interesting. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So are you seeing, uh, from the role perspective, they&amp;#8217;ve now seen it. Now you have a different people coming in with different. Needs and wants for their website. And is there someone unifying that from the client perspective or is it a lot of different stakeholders coming, going, well, we need this. Okay. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is there somebody synthesizing all of that?&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; We play that role where we can, uh, where, where we have been allowed to. I think we st oftentimes we&amp;#8217;ll get very lucky and we&amp;#8217;ll have a C-level, um, stakeholder involved that can do, uh, the, I think of as like a Venn diagram where you have linear thinkers and strategic [00:13:00] thinkers. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that overlapping section is someone who can live in both worlds or at least empathize very well, uh, with one or the other. So, Um, we play that role as often as we can, uh, and we try to move people into a space where they realize that is possible. Uh, two things can be true. Uh, you can want to have a very grand strategic, um, uh, presence, you know, with, with wonderful colors and layout and good copy, but at the same time, There&amp;#8217;s some technical decisions that need to be made. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, you know, and some research that needs to be done kind of in between. So overlapping, uh, you&amp;#8217;ll see, um, there are specific roles. Marketing managers I find are kind of expanding into that. Um, and they&amp;#8217;re sourcing companies like us to handle the technical depth, um, and to help us translate that, that gray area, um, where you have strategy. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kind of overlapping with this linear direction of where people wanna go. [00:14:00]&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; So oftentimes it&amp;#8217;s the CEO marketing manager type that is your point person. But then are there other teams or are they funneling through that person, or are they coming straight to valet, for instance, on those?&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, they&amp;#8217;ll come straight to us. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;ll come straight to us. We work with a lot of different people within, uh, within the. The org chart. Um, but really the kind of, you have to be in a position. Where you are looking at the forest and the trees. Mm-hmm. Um, to be able to kind of drive direction or, um, get the most value out of the advice in the consultation, you know, that, that an agency like our can offer. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because we can&amp;#8217;t come across too, um, too bossy, right? You&amp;#8217;re using the wrong thing. Why would you tell me that? I researched and it&amp;#8217;s fine. No, I&amp;#8217;m not saying it because you&amp;#8217;re wrong. I&amp;#8217;m saying because, you know, we, we have experience. We can give you a better option. So, um, you know, it&amp;#8217;s, and we can see the [00:15:00] forest, you know, we know what else is going on. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I know you really wanna use this one tool, but you have this other one over here that you&amp;#8217;re not aware of that someone else installed. Um, you know, and those won&amp;#8217;t work together. So, you know, it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s. We work really well with roles that kind of have essentially the same purview in their job that we have in ours as tech advisors. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Uh, it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s so interesting cuz you mentioned kind of in the, first of all this, the role of the webmaster. That&amp;#8217;s, and you know, in the early days it was maybe find somebody that can cobble this stuff together. Uh, but that changing role where they see the importance and then go, but they still need someone with expertise that can advise them, should I, I can go left or right, which way should I go? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And it seems like which the role you&amp;#8217;re, you all are providing too is offer, there&amp;#8217;s a couple of paths here and maybe steer them to one particular path.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s a lot of what it is, is what&amp;#8217;s the best path for you? [00:16:00] You know, it, you may be, uh, if there&amp;#8217;s these three or four very important things, which one would benefit you the most? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, let&amp;#8217;s go there first and then we can go back to the three or four important things. That&amp;#8217;s, there&amp;#8217;s no static list of what&amp;#8217;s best. Mm-hmm. I mean, there&amp;#8217;s a static list of, um, what&amp;#8217;s good. But what&amp;#8217;s best? I mean, that depends. What do you, what do you need? Are you interested in growth? Are you interested in converting, are you interested in education? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, those are all very different, very different things.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; And you said too, like depth. So there&amp;#8217;s someone here at the organization has these strategic goals, things they want to do, um, but the depth part, and that&amp;#8217;s where, you know, Online work is pretty deep. It&amp;#8217;s so nuanced. There&amp;#8217;s so much stuff going on. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right. In your post, you mentioned, you know, performing well in the search engine, the SEARCHs, the search engine results, um, speed. Mm-hmm. All those kind of things they probably don&amp;#8217;t think about. And the work I&amp;#8217;ve done or helped [00:17:00] with, um, Lindsey&amp;#8217;s, my wife&amp;#8217;s Lindsey that you know real well. Um, what&amp;#8217;s her marketing agency is love her. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s about it. They understand strategic strategy, that what they need to do and what they need to get accomplished, but don&amp;#8217;t always have that level of depth in-house. Mm-hmm. And we were talking before we got started on the recording here, about kind of the changing roles of like, the importance of having vendors out here. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mm-hmm. That. You know, to hire someone with this type of expertise is probably gonna be pretty hard. Uh, at almost any level. There&amp;#8217;s obviously enterprise, you know, companies that have whole teams that do web stuff. But still probably, I think, and I&amp;#8217;ve seen from our membership at Post Status still outsource a lot of the depth we&amp;#8217;re talking about because yes, it&amp;#8217;s hard to hire a WordPress professional that knows all these things and run this gamut. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mm-hmm. And we were talking specifically about this role. Um, my view is, [00:18:00] When I was helping a client a couple years ago, uh, they&amp;#8217;d often referred to me, I was doing consulting with him as a vendor, and I&amp;#8217;d go, but. But I feel more, I care about the mission and goals of what you&amp;#8217;re trying to get accomplished. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mm-hmm. And I don&amp;#8217;t think of myself as just someone that comes in, slots in, doesn&amp;#8217;t work, comes back out leaves. Yep. Uh, I might have multiple clients and stuff, and I think that has to shift a little bit because of the nature of the work that we&amp;#8217;re doing, that you can&amp;#8217;t maybe just hire a professional that has all that. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I need 10 of those with all the verticals you could think. Right. And so we&amp;#8217;re kind of talking about that shift and that&amp;#8217;s where that see Vale, you&amp;#8217;re truly not a vendor, you&amp;#8217;re partner mm-hmm. In what you&amp;#8217;re doing with them. Like you&amp;#8217;re saying, stick to what you do best. We&amp;#8217;ll take this part, these parts that you don&amp;#8217;t do best and go deep in those. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, and I&amp;#8217;m curious your thoughts about all that. You mentioned fractional, so I, I&amp;#8217;m curious what your perspective is of this shift and what you see in the market.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh. [00:19:00] Um, I think it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s similar to the, the culture shift, uh, within companies where they want everybody to have culture, but they don&amp;#8217;t necessarily hire based on culture, you know? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, I think, um, building, um, building a team, people talk about fractionals now, right? Oh, fractional cmo, fractional, CFO, and. It, it implies that something&amp;#8217;s broken. I don&amp;#8217;t know, just the language, you know, like fractional. I don&amp;#8217;t need you all the time. I just need you to solve these specific problems. But that&amp;#8217;s inherently broken in and of itself in that, um, you&amp;#8217;re not incorporating someone into the big picture. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think of it sort of, uh, my kiddo play soccer, right? So you have these forward positions, these midfield positions, and these, these defensive positions. And not everybody plays at the same time, but they&amp;#8217;re all very important to have on the field. I mean, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t call one a fractional forward, right? I wouldn&amp;#8217;t call one a fractional defender. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They [00:20:00] know their positions deeply and they operate with the other team members in a way that. Is holistic. It makes sense. You know, they, they work together and they do their job when the time comes. So instead of fractional, um, you know, it, it&amp;#8217;s like a world of fractionals. Now everybody&amp;#8217;s fractional. Um, but if, if we could just reposition the way that vendor relationship, that vendor ideal. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The, the, oh, you&amp;#8217;re a contractor. No, you, you, if you hire for, for depth in a specific subject matter, then you have a defender standing on the back line. Waiting for their time to, to come in. They know their job. They know their, and you don&amp;#8217;t have to sit up there as forward worrying about will this person be able to handle, handle that role in that, in that attack that&amp;#8217;s coming on. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right. So it&amp;#8217;s a mindset shift, I think, for the businesses, and I think it&amp;#8217;s a struggle because. I mean, what? It&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s either part-time work or full-time work, right? All of our employment and labor laws are, are based around [00:21:00] 32 hours or 40 hours a week. You have to give people a certain amount of breaks after if they&amp;#8217;ve done so much work. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, this is how the world was built. This is how our, our knowing and understanding of working is. So, uh, I think it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s probably a little more high level than thinking about this idea of fractional and having someone come in and tell me what I need to do and then let me work on it. Um, you know, you, you bring someone in to give you good advice and then map out the action steps. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;#8217;re capable and you have a team member to do that, then fine. But don&amp;#8217;t, don&amp;#8217;t think I can&amp;#8217;t, I don&amp;#8217;t need a full-time, um, you know, financial officer e who does, you know, I mean, unless you have a huge company, no one&amp;#8217;s sitting there flipping through spreadsheets all day long, making sure that your numbers are in the right column in the spreadsheets, right? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They, that that financial officer often acts in other capacities. So what&amp;#8217;s the difference, right? If you have a vendor that just doesn&amp;#8217;t do that all the time for you, you pay them whatever that time is worth and valuable to you to do what [00:22:00] you need them to do effectively. And that&amp;#8217;s okay. It doesn&amp;#8217;t need to be defined as anything other than teamwork. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Uh, but that&amp;#8217;s a hard concept to wrap your mind around when you&amp;#8217;re in a traditional business setting. Does that make sense?&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, it does. It illuminated so much for me with that. I think it&amp;#8217;s an analogy, but, um, if, you know businesses are in a game, Organizations are in a game to do something, make money, whatever those. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, from your nonprofits too, is make impact too. Um, but you think about that if the game is business or like soccer. Right. I loved when you said that you st you need certain players on the field to accomplish that and I love that how you said like a defender back here might not. Be the one that everybody thinks about. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, the one that&amp;#8217;s gonna score the goal, but you need someone with the goal going so the ball goes over the heads and you&amp;#8217;re someone there to do this role. And I, I love that. Cause I think it really paints it very beautifully. You&amp;#8217;re trying to do that shift you talked [00:23:00] about too. You need to fill the whole team. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mm-hmm. And you need certain players on the team to get that job done. And I love that, like valet in this instance might have four players. On the team. Mm-hmm. Um, that, that quote aren&amp;#8217;t full-time employees, obviously, but you still need those, you need a goalie back here. You need, uh, those degrees, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; right. We can still supply you with technical depth. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can supply you with design depth. We can supply you with content depth. You know, it, that, that&amp;#8217;s the, that&amp;#8217;s the benefit of the different players on the field, whereas you&amp;#8217;re not hiring one person to do SEO 24 hours. You know, a day, uh, or eight hours a day, 40 hours a week rather for going with the working analogy. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the, the idea is you, it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s not any less important to have. To have that available.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, if you use this, I might just kind of continue to, to, to expand on this cause I love it.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Should we say football? Uh, do we have an international audience, should we say?&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; [00:24:00] I, I think soccer&amp;#8217;s pretty international so we can stay there. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soccer, I just don&amp;#8217;t know as much about soccer, but I&amp;#8217;ll say like, If you think about there as offensive players, and I&amp;#8217;m not sure what they&amp;#8217;re called in soccer, but they&amp;#8217;re the ones that need to go score the, score the goals, hit the hit the goal, hit the mission that you&amp;#8217;re trying to do. The way I think about that before this conversation was stay in your core genius. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s the thing that people come to you? Because that&amp;#8217;s the word, the magic happens, right? Those are the people you probably might need to continue to retain as a full-time employee, as part of your team.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, that&amp;#8217;s your marketing director, right? That&amp;#8217;s your person. That&amp;#8217;s the attacker going up, scoring the goals they know. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;re supported. The ball has been passed up to them. A beautiful cross from, you know, your tech team or your, your content writing team, whatever supports your mm-hmm. Your major goals that you got going on. And then they, they dive right in and. Kick one in the corner of the net because they know, they know the, the, the consumer base. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They know your customers, they know your keywords. They know what your strategy should be. They know where you wanna go next, you know, and then someone else helps them implement [00:25:00] that. That&amp;#8217;s the most powerful. It&amp;#8217;s not, it&amp;#8217;s no longer a, a game of, uh, how many balls can I juggle, and how many skills can I put on my resume? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s. It&amp;#8217;s how, how much time have I spent on this one skill has become, um, I, I don&amp;#8217;t know if it&amp;#8217;s valued as much as it should be. It&amp;#8217;s something that businesses value in vendors, which I find very interesting. But they don&amp;#8217;t necessarily value in, in immediate hires, I think some, as much as they should. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mm-hmm. You know, vendors. How, how many times have you, have you, uh, drawn a red balloon for a company in the healthcare space like me? Right? Is that really important or should you be more concerned about. What kind of tools do I use to draw my red balloon? What color red am I using? You know, is there a specific healthcare friendly color palette that we&amp;#8217;re using or, or those sorts of things that are, that are supportive of, of the skill that I&amp;#8217;ve spent so much time working on design, and can I make a realistic balloon? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if I&amp;#8217;ve drawn 500 of them, if they look like. Anime and that&amp;#8217;s not what you want then. Mm-hmm. You know, it doesn&amp;#8217;t really help you out any. Right. Do you want a realistic [00:26:00] balloon then? Yes. I&amp;#8217;ve drawn hundreds of realistic balloons in many different colors. Or, you know, it&amp;#8217;s, I&amp;#8217;m probably going off the rails with that, but point being, it&amp;#8217;s not, it&amp;#8217;s not valued as much, uh, with vendors or, or, uh, it&amp;#8217;s not valued much with instant hires as much as it&amp;#8217;s required of vendors. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right. You have, you have to have this very deep and specific knowledge. Well, you hire, you hire in-house, and you want someone to have 17 skills. I&amp;#8217;ve seen so many LinkedIn, WordPress, uh, job postings in the last couple of months, especially with the flood in the market. And it&amp;#8217;s like, must have deep knowledge of c s s must be able to project, manage and communicate effectively across team members must be able to, uh, turn concepts into action plans and must know css. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Do you know if you want anybody to know? Sorry. You know, if you want anybody to know those things deeply enough to do them effectively at well, You know, with all of the cross browser, um, things that you need to know and, and accessibility and, and all that kind of stuff, like, [00:27:00] that&amp;#8217;s a big, big ask. Yeah. Big ask for one human. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely. And that, that&amp;#8217;s just defining that role too of agency. You think about what you do at Val as you find, recruit, train, uh, hire all those, those professionals that fit that job description. But would go, I probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t be as interested doing that role at an organization, but that you find a team of those there. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;re doing all of that work that takes time, energy, all that expertise to do all that. Why not let it over here? And you think about, there&amp;#8217;s one note you mentioned in the job skills. It&amp;#8217;s like being able to communicate across team. It&amp;#8217;s like that&amp;#8217;s your role as CEO of valet is to make sure that your team here of experts. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Inward press in particular are communicating as a team back to customers. So like why would you take that extra cognitive load too, would be my thought. Stick to the things you do best, the things that, [00:28:00] what you&amp;#8217;re scoring the goals back to soccer, you&amp;#8217;re, you&amp;#8217;re the star. Those stars do that for them. What you get to do for those that are the backstop, the defenders, like you said back there. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I, I, to me I think that&amp;#8217;s way more efficient and realistic. Um, because we know, uh, Lindsay is in the process of hiring under pressure right now, and it just takes so much time to source, find, go through the vetting process, have those co, it&amp;#8217;s just extremely time intensive. And then when we&amp;#8217;re talking to the pre-roll, it&amp;#8217;s like, You know, oftentimes when you&amp;#8217;re hiring somebody, you wanna find the right fit, but you, you always end up, uh, onboarding, training, guiding those people to do the best for what you&amp;#8217;re trying to do as an agency. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, uh, I just go, that&amp;#8217;s a lot of effort. We&amp;#8217;ve at, at our previous company, at Themes. That&amp;#8217;s what we did. We hired experts. The things that we weren&amp;#8217;t good at, couldn&amp;#8217;t be good at to, couldn&amp;#8217;t even be. Close to good at find experts with experience and [00:29:00] expertise, pull them in and like back to soccer, I go, the coach is your CEO, your marketing manager out there that needs to execute, but should spend majority of their time on those star players on their team. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then source the rest of their team through quality people that are worrying about that all the time. To me, that just feels like no-brainer, by the way, Kimberly. But you know, I&amp;#8217;m, uh, I say I&amp;#8217;m biased, but I just look at it from a business perspective and I go, I like this trend, uh, where that typical vendor relationship should get an enhancement. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You shouldn&amp;#8217;t think about. Well, You know, they get paid from valet or whatever it is, whatever agency. They&amp;#8217;re not part of our team. But if you think about it and find an agency like Valet that really cares, wants to do a great job and play that role on their team, hey, I think we should upgrade that, that. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mindset and approach and attitude of contractors, vendors, and say, well, are they part of our [00:30:00] team? They might be fractionally part of our team, but we don&amp;#8217;t need them a hundred percent of the time. Right. And that&amp;#8217;s where I think about what, what you all offer, and I&amp;#8217;ve told you this for years, I love what you offer because it&amp;#8217;s not just maintenance, it&amp;#8217;s not just these things that you can probably get. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A number of agencies. It&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s understanding that mindset, playing those roles on the field for your client. Mm-hmm. Because you all do. And I wanna talk about that. I wanna shift gears a little bit about what you do, because I think your approach is pretty awesome, authentic, I think you all created this category. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, and, but you do it to this level, high level that is, Not just, well, but if you just maintain my website and my updates and my plugin themes, all that kind of stuff, that&amp;#8217;s cool. But it doesn&amp;#8217;t, it doesn&amp;#8217;t to me go that to be that player on the field. Could you talk a little bit about the holistic service? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cause you said in the, in the beginning, end to end, it&amp;#8217;s really compelling, but what does that mean?&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, well we had many iterations of this. I think we had the [00:31:00] website, health pyramid, and then we had these pillars at one point. Um, but it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s really the idea that, um, expanding on the, the beliefs of what different stakeholders in a business can do for the, or the website can do for them. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s kind of the flip side of that in the tech stack where now, because there are so many different things required, And so many different niches and expertise and all of these people that follow that you can follow that say, I can tell you how to do X really well. Uh, but that&amp;#8217;s one out of a thousand things that your website does or one out of a thousand things that your, your marketing manager does really end to end is, is conceptual in, um, conversion traffic or can people use your website? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is the tech stack healthy? Um, are you performing? You know, are there any opportunities for improvement? But it&amp;#8217;s iterative, right? Because as you, as you grow, as you change things, you need to go back and kind of reevaluate all those. It&amp;#8217;s a [00:32:00] shifting. I haven&amp;#8217;t been able to find a really good graphic for it. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I feel like even the pyramid, when we had it, it was probably, it was good, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t the best. Um, still it wasn&amp;#8217;t the most accurate way of, of kind of, Displaying and visually how these things shift, uh, with new people, new processes, new ideas, new initiatives within a company. You know, it, there&amp;#8217;s always something that you, you can look at and there&amp;#8217;s always something to revisit. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then when you tie in metrics, right? We started doing these data dashboards and you start tying in metrics and looking at things that you can actually measure and set goals with. Um, you know, then it becomes a whole new ballgame. Well, now you&amp;#8217;re, now you&amp;#8217;re tweaking. Now you&amp;#8217;re, you&amp;#8217;ve entered Formula One and. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, you&amp;#8217;re moving little tiny notches on the engine to get that extra, you know, half a second off your start time or your run time, uh, because you&amp;#8217;re, you&amp;#8217;re really in the big leagues at that point, right? So, um, but even, even in the smaller, the smaller, um, medium business sector, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of people that don&amp;#8217;t realize that [00:33:00] there&amp;#8217;s a lot of layers. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Uh, good example. Um, we have a wonderful client. Who was looking at their Google page speed times. And of course, we all know it&amp;#8217;s a rabbit hole, right? I want a hundred. No, you don&amp;#8217;t want a hundred, you can&amp;#8217;t get a hundred, uh, for many reasons. But, um, you know, and even if you do, it doesn&amp;#8217;t, it doesn&amp;#8217;t, if you get a hundred, it doesn&amp;#8217;t knock up your, your search engine ratings, right? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, you know, what are you actually going for there, right? But, um, we&amp;#8217;re looking at some page speed, low times and had to have a, a big discussion about. Image sizes on a page image weight. So how big the actual file size is. Also, you&amp;#8217;re using a page builder also you&amp;#8217;re using, um, this thing in here. Also, you&amp;#8217;re maxing out two PHP workers every week, um, with the stuff that you need on your tech stack. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s not the hosting that&amp;#8217;s your problem necessarily, but you could be giving your hosting an easier time. So all these things intertwine. They intermix. I had an email [00:34:00] today. You know, uh, I need to move hosting, um, but also wanna do registration and, and webinars later. Glad you mentioned that because just hosting and hosting with webinars and registration for things is, you know, those are two different considerations. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You need two different things. So, um, it&amp;#8217;s is a, a big. A big thread that runs through all of these things that you need as far as user experience, um, accessibility, usability, tech stack, speed, performance, you know, I mean, optimization, you know, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of, a lot of, a lot of things that overlap. You can&amp;#8217;t just kind of dive deep into one anymore, so you need that end to end where people, you know, you may not. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Need to dive into all of those things. But you need to, to understand or work with someone who understands that those are all part of the equation. When you&amp;#8217;re having a conversation, it&amp;#8217;s not hitting a hammer, I&amp;#8217;m not hitting a nail with a hammer. You know, you&amp;#8217;re mm-hmm. You&amp;#8217;re looking at, you know, an entire piece of furniture that you&amp;#8217;re trying to put together. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So if you [00:35:00] cut this one part, maybe those four things fall down. Um, or if you add something here, maybe you weaken another part of the structure. What if we put something here, we can bolster everything. You know, so having that comprehensive knowledge of that&amp;#8217;s what end-to-end, I get in, in, in my words, my many words mm-hmm. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Means,&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; well, we, we talked about the first is like if a web, the website, your organization&amp;#8217;s website is vitally important to your strategy and what you&amp;#8217;re trying to get done. You need someone to go to that has depth of knowledge and breadth. Of, of services that can get you to where you&amp;#8217;re going. So I think at some point you&amp;#8217;re part mechanic, part your tuner upper performance. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, but it&amp;#8217;s like when you are trying to, to do something that&amp;#8217;s integral to your business, that involves your WordPress website, that&amp;#8217;s where valet comes in and why this is compelling to me, cuz you know, one of our, uh, the businesses we have an investment in, we brought to valet because we go, she doesn&amp;#8217;t [00:36:00] need, um, development all the time. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right, but sometimes she needs functionality, new features, new things for the website to get done what she&amp;#8217;s trying to get done. And that was why it was so compelling that you also offer bundles. I think of development time where you know, to try to hire that out or try to do a full-time employee is gonna be, I think, near impossible. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But I love that cause it was co so compelling. She might need this month, three hours of development type work. Well, they have someone to go to that&amp;#8217;s trusted, trained, great communicators to do all that, to get it done. And that&amp;#8217;s why that end ends so interesting. Cause I know in the health pyramid that we talked about, uh, a while back, um, you&amp;#8217;re thinking about all, all, all the way to analytics and metrics. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To features and functionality too. I just need to create a new page that has these things to, to promote my new, you know, offering those types of services. That&amp;#8217;s what you all offer and I think that&amp;#8217;s [00:37:00] why Vale is really compelling in the space. I wish not to get you just more competitors here, but I wish there was more people that understood like businesses and organizations need this. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They can&amp;#8217;t, they&amp;#8217;re not just gonna go higher, you know, develop, develop full-time developer rates right now are. Insane. They&amp;#8217;re pretty, and I&amp;#8217;m glad because our professionals are worth it, but that you&amp;#8217;re like, I, I couldn&amp;#8217;t even think 120, $150,000 a year to just get someone that knows the stuff. But from a fractional, time wise, I can get those three, that expertise in bundles just when I need it. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mm-hmm. Um, and then someone that knows all the way from development to metrics, health analytics, performance that understands the connection of faster spot site equals. SEO equals more traffic equals potentially more conversions in that holistic way, I think is pretty, pretty and compelling. Yeah.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Being able to give advice with, um, [00:38:00] with a, with all of that depth of experience. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a, there&amp;#8217;s a story, um, The guy with the hammer that goes to work on a, on a submarine. Have you heard that one? Uhuh? Uh, there&amp;#8217;s, um, they&amp;#8217;re working on a submarine and, and this guy just can&amp;#8217;t quite get, uh, the backend, the propeller work in something&amp;#8217;s going on with it. So he, he goes through his Rolodex and finds this propeller specialist. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That, that he knows that they&amp;#8217;ve called it in the past when they&amp;#8217;ve hit really, really tough problems. Cuz he is gotta get the submarine work in, he wants to get it going. He, this is the one thing that he just can&amp;#8217;t, you know, solve for some reason. And so he calls the guy in and the guy comes in, he is got this giant toolbox and he spends about 10 minutes looking, poking around, moving some things. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And he opens up his toolbox and pulls out this teeny tiny hammer and he walks up to the propeller, moves his finger around just a little bit and taps on it twice. And he says it&amp;#8217;s fixed and the guy goes up and he, you know, kind of spins it, oh my gosh, this is great. You fixed it. We can get going. You know, this is a huge piece [00:39:00] of machinery. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a huge project we&amp;#8217;re working on. This is a huge initiative. And the guy says, okay, I&amp;#8217;ll send you an invoice. So he sends him an invoice for $40,000 and the guy was like, he calls him up, he&amp;#8217;s like, man, $40,000. Are you kidding me? And he goes, oh, I&amp;#8217;ll, I&amp;#8217;ll send you an itemized invoice. And it was like, you know, um, uh, $10,000, you know, for my time, and then $30,000 knowing where to tap with the hammer. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Uh, you know, it&amp;#8217;s that, it&amp;#8217;s that whole idea of, I don&amp;#8217;t know if that&amp;#8217;s that&amp;#8217;s valued as much, you know, as it was because there&amp;#8217;s so many specialists. Everybody&amp;#8217;s a specialist. So why would you value, um, someone with a, with a broad based knowledge of, of an industry as much as you used to?&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, well if you, if you&amp;#8217;re getting married and won a piano player for your wedding, you gotta take into account that person has been probably spending decades. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yep. Learning the piano, learning the, the music. Practicing. Practicing to understand and back to the [00:40:00] summer music, exactly where they hit.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure there&amp;#8217;s like a, a Reddit thread with like, all kinds of stories like that. Right? Where what do you mean you, you know, you only gonna, you wanna charge me $250? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a one hour wedding, you know, well, classically trained, but okay.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, so far we talked about the value of the website growing in importance, and so glad to hear that what you&amp;#8217;re seeing too, what we&amp;#8217;re seeing. Um, we&amp;#8217;ve talked about that role of the classic vendor changing, um, in a good way. Finding agencies like we have at Word at, uh, post status WordPress agencies, like Valet has been doing it for. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gosh, how, how long have you been doing this, Valerie? I, I said Val and smash it together. Kimberly,&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Valerie, it&amp;#8217;ll be my new screen name. Um, a about a little over 10 years. Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s been, it&amp;#8217;s been a long time.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; No kidding. Years. You&amp;#8217;ve seen a lot too. Yeah, so [00:41:00] finding that agency, it has the depth of experience, has the team that can execute, has that knowledge to be that back to the soccer, to be a player or multiple players on your field, so you get to focus on what you do best. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;#8217;s credible and, and that just, I think, for me is a perspective on our industry, particularly with WordPress. But on the internet, the. Increasing value of, um, both websites and agencies that can do that. Take that down for you. Anything else we missed that you wanna share or, or talk about?&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, we, uh, we soft launched a, a new, um, a new. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Refresh of the site. Um, we had to readjust our plans based on this, this conversation actually that we&amp;#8217;re having just kind of this change in shift in market, being able to provide more core competencies, um, that are highly skilled. Um, [00:42:00] and then we&amp;#8217;ve kind of, we&amp;#8217;re toying around with a new version of a smaller package. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That we&amp;#8217;re calling Valet Express. Uh, that kind of gets you a lot of the core things that you need, um, covers that, you know, the, the gives you the basics of the end-to-end. To be able to at least see and look at things. You know, if you want help with them, then you can get help with them, if not, but, um, our, our standard plans have shifted and now include an advisor, um, for the larger ones, uh, to meet at least two times a year. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we can kind of stay up to date, keep up with, you know, funding cycles and, you know, uh, group initiatives and, you know, be able to help plan and that kind of stuff. So, um, really excited because I mean, we, we act in an advisory capacity anytime we talk to someone, you know, make an email and an ask a question anytime they want. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, um, you know, being present for those, for those meetings and changes and, and discussions is something that we really wanna. Make ourselves more available for, we&amp;#8217;re always [00:43:00] available for it, but we&amp;#8217;re never like, Hey, it&amp;#8217;s time for your six month meeting. You know, we make it more important. Uh, Then it, it smooths, it smooths the process a lot, and I think that&amp;#8217;s a big part of us trying to contribute, to help shift that idea of being, uh, invested. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We know that we love what we do, and I think that&amp;#8217;s why we&amp;#8217;re good at it is just because we like helping. We like learning. We&amp;#8217;re not invested in selling anything in particular other than just being there, you know, and doing it. Right. We&amp;#8217;re just nerds for. We&amp;#8217;re trying to get it right and, and figure it out. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mm-hmm. So, you know, that&amp;#8217;s what makes us passionate. So, um, you know, we&amp;#8217;ve, we&amp;#8217;ve done a, a little bit of, uh, kind of adjusting. There&amp;#8217;s still more to come, but that was kind of the first. The first big push. There&amp;#8217;ll be lots of other little changes and things we&amp;#8217;re gonna grow and add in. But, uh, you know, that&amp;#8217;s, that&amp;#8217;s been exciting. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m so happy.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;m so excited. That&amp;#8217;s great. Well, somebody&amp;#8217;s like, Hey, I need a nerd to help how all this fits in. Um, how do they get started and talk, get started talking to you all at Vale. What&amp;#8217;s the next step?&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, [00:44:00] we have a contact form on the website. We have a phone call scheduling on the website now, and you can just, hello@valet.io rhymes. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s easy to remember, uh, and, you know, we&amp;#8217;ll, we&amp;#8217;ll talk to you, you know that any, every conversation has to be, um, started with an idea of what you wanna do, where you wanna go, and what your goals are. I mean, that&amp;#8217;s, that makes for the most effective communication. Um, so yeah, that&amp;#8217;s the best way. Just say, hey, and we&amp;#8217;ll say, Hey, what you doing? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What you wanna do? And we&amp;#8217;ll go from there. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; I love it. I think that last part is key. Knowing what you want to do, where you want to go, and then coming to the website advisors vale to figure out how to get there. Absolutely key. Thank you. Kimberly Lepar of valet, CEO. Um, I appreciate your time sharing what you&amp;#8217;re seeing in the market and how you all help connect in with, um, clients for this cool thing we call the Open Web and WordPress. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Lipari:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Love it. It&amp;#8217;s a place to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/planet/feed/#h-transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript&lt;/a&gt; â&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this episode, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/coreymaass&quot;&gt;Corey Maass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/corymiller303&quot;&gt;Cory Miller&lt;/a&gt; move from personal to professional. They offer impactful transparency, from discussing the importance of website speed, user experience, and SEO to practicing mindfulness and finding balance. They share insights on optimizing WordPress websites for performance, including hosting, caching, and image optimization tips. They also discuss the role of content in driving traffic and engagement, as well as strategies for leveraging social media to grow an online presence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Takeaways:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imposter Syndrome.&lt;/strong&gt; Imposter syndrome is very common among people who work in tech, and it&amp;#8217;s important to acknowledge it and understand that it&amp;#8217;s okay to feel this way. It&amp;#8217;s helpful to talk to others about your feelings and to remind yourself of your accomplishments and skills. It&amp;#8217;s important not to compare yourself to others and focus on your progress and growth. Seeking support from a therapist or coach can be very helpful in managing imposter syndrome.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slow Hustle.&lt;/strong&gt; Take a more intentional, thoughtful, and sustainable approach to work and life. Instead of constantly hustling and working long hours, âslow hustleâ focuses on balancing work and rest, taking breaks, and being intentional about your work. Finding a pace that works for you helps in avoiding burnout. âSlow hustleâ can help you find more fulfillment and purpose in your work and can be beneficial for long-term success.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Brand. &lt;/strong&gt;Building a personal brand can help in various aspects of life. Establish your personal brand by identifying and highlighting your unique skills and strengths, being authentic and consistent, and cultivating relationships. Use social media and online platforms to share your expertise and connect with potential clients or collaborators. Continually invest in your personal and professional development, whether through learning new skills, attending conferences, or seeking mentorship or coaching. Remember the importance of maintaining a positive and professional online presence and reputation, as this can greatly impact your personal brand and career success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;Session 11 Corey &amp;amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; [00:00:00] Um, we are on session 11, and this is gonna be a fun one. We&amp;#8217;re kind of in rebooting. Last week we talked about, um, blew out the vision and see all the options. And then, um, got some good stuff there. And now I think next step is, um, drum roll. Taking a lane.Â  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Uh, you know, when in, when in, we are a startup, right? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like we, we ride razor scooters around our office. Uh, we have a kegerator in our co-working space. String lights. We have string lights, like all the cool kids. Um, we are pivoting. Pivoting is what you do. Oh, there you go.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Um, I think we talked about, uh, Silicon Valley on H B O [00:01:00] and uh, I actually had a yellow Ford Escape. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was driving. It was my commuter car. And uh, it was funny, my team was making fun of me about it cuz uh, ATO, Avi&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Aviato. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, so yeah, the, I think, and I think last time we summarized a bit about how we&amp;#8217;ve arrived here, where the idea came from. Um, and so I, I have a couple of updates that I could start with. Um, the first is, I. Released, uh, an update of Crop Express, um, the, our, our legacy product, um, and or our lead gen product or what have you, um, that now has, uh, there was a, I had not successfully, correctly [00:02:00] implemented the constraints. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Size constraints. And so that is fixed. Um, and it also now has the, our updated readme that you and I put together from the last call or the call before. Um, and so to me, I want to add one more feature that we had talked about, which was basically a, a, um, power user bypass. Because I even at one point I was like, oh, I, you know, I need an, uh, a circle image cropped, let me quick use my own tool. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I went in and it like, you know what it output was, I don&amp;#8217;t remember. 2000 or something. And I was like, wait, this isn&amp;#8217;t, this isn&amp;#8217;t what I want. Like, I want to be able to say, you know, real quick, like we talked about, use it anywhere. Like, just make it a thousand, you know? And so I&amp;#8217;m gonna add, um, a simple dropdown. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think what I [00:03:00] wanna do is, Like, first of all, it doesn&amp;#8217;t tell you anywhere in the cropper what it, what size it&amp;#8217;s gonna output it at. Um, uh, you know, you&amp;#8217;ve potentially set that in the setting screen, but you haven&amp;#8217;t, you don&amp;#8217;t know when you&amp;#8217;re actually cropping. And so I want to add that. And then what I think I&amp;#8217;m gonna do is add it as a dropdown. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s like this, you know, based on your settings, this is going to export as 2000 by 2000 or a thousand by a thousand or whatever. But in the dropdown I&amp;#8217;ll have essentially like two x, three x four x, you know, 0.75 x 0.5 x. So it&amp;#8217;ll be, you know, in the dropdown it&amp;#8217;s like, this is going to export at 2000, but from the dropdown you can say 1000 and then bang, um, or something like that. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s just real simple. And then, um, and then if we want to, we can, you know, or total customize and put in, [00:04:00] you can put in. Whatever crazy numbers you want, but the idea of being, you know, quick and easy, you can do something slightly different or proportionately different, logically different.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Hey, gimme one second. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I forgot to do this. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Sorry. So we start over? Yeah, no, it&amp;#8217;s fine. Um, yeah, so often awesome&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; confirmation cuz like, you value the product that you built, we did together, right? Um, enough to go, I&amp;#8217;m using it, I want to keep using it. And I think that&amp;#8217;s invaluable from a product perspective. Like mm-hmm you what, what&amp;#8217;s there and want to make it, hone it for your own thing, which I think is such a great origin for any product. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, and the whole eat your own dog food kind of situation of like, you know, I don&amp;#8217;t want to open Photoshop and add a circle and da da. Like, this should just be easy. Yeah. Um, so, um, with [00:05:00] that, the other, the other thing I wanna do, but I is of lower importance at the moment is to redo Crop Express the website so that it, um, has all the new features and is set up the way we want it. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But I think that&amp;#8217;ll be a, a weekend hackathon slightly down the road since we are deemphasizing this, the website of it, implementation of it is further deemphasized. Um, so that&amp;#8217;s that. And then, um, let me actually share my screen. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Share. You see that? All right? Yeah. Okay, so, um, so as we talked about, I had gone somewhat far down the path of, uh, building a plugin that works against, uh, [00:06:00] screenshot Express, which is the screenshot SAS service, a API that I built. Um, so you&amp;#8217;ll see reference to social images, which was just sort of the project name, um, that I started with. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, but I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m so, um, me and my crazy colors, oops, sorry about the dogs. Um, me and my crazy eighties colors. Um, there&amp;#8217;s screenshot express, so I&amp;#8217;m actually pretty, um, pleased with myself, uh, with the implementation that I built initially. So, um, So here&amp;#8217;s what we have so far, essentially is, um, by activating this, it, it should throw you to a welcome screen. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It currently doesn&amp;#8217;t, um, but it has this very cool, like the colors of the app. Um, and so you can either sign up for an account or you can log in. Um, [00:07:00] so naturally I&amp;#8217;m going to just log in. Um, hopefully you can&amp;#8217;t see my passwords.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Um, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; it signs you in. Um, it shows you what active licenses you have. If you have one already, um, you hit select and then great. It&amp;#8217;s all saved. So that&amp;#8217;s the onboarding. And obviously like that&amp;#8217;s purely technical, but that&amp;#8217;s, you know, all the steps involved with connecting yourself to the screenshot express service. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, and so obviously up for much debate between the two of us, like how we wanna, what we want to call it, how much we wanna obfuscate that we&amp;#8217;re actually using screenshot express, behind the scenes, all that stuff. But at least technically there it is. Um, and then, um, I ripped [00:08:00] out some of the stuff that I had, um, but I think you can, we can sort of illustrate at least the, what we&amp;#8217;ve got in mind here. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, and this is where I, I wanted to start talking through with you. Um, A first imagined workflow, right? So that in my mind, here&amp;#8217;s how this works, right? So you&amp;#8217;re like, I write a blog post and array block editor. Um, and then presumably you&amp;#8217;d save draft or you&amp;#8217;d publish, but let&amp;#8217;s just publish for the sake of it, right? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, and then you&amp;#8217;re like, okay, now I want to promote my blog post. Um, oh, let me add a featured image, upload a file, um, testing nice pretty [00:09:00] landscape set featured image update. I don&amp;#8217;t, this might work. This might not work. But anyway, um, so it&amp;#8217;s like you&amp;#8217;ve got a published blog post and then you say to yourself, okay, now I want to create. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Images for sharing this to on Twitter and Facebook. Um, and so what I have so far in here, I have to go start, uh, whoops. Open. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s always fun doing it. Live tech demo. N p m, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;no, of course this will work. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;m trying to write some notes too when we get there. Um, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; oh. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okay, not you. Next. CSS js. [00:10:00] Oh, welcome. Okay. Why are you not just working? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; This is real life. Does this sound good?&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Um, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;it is real, real life social images. I am in the right place. Um, I have the stuff that I was deleting. Uh, it&amp;#8217;s not admin, its build. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I dunno. This should just work. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Um, while you&amp;#8217;re doing that, I&amp;#8217;m. I&amp;#8217;m thinking about what you&amp;#8217;d want in the end product. Mm-hmm. The basic. Mm-hmm. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; So plugin. Oh, I didn&amp;#8217;t activate the plugin. Oh no, I did. It&amp;#8217;s there. [00:11:00] Um, oh gosh. I don&amp;#8217;t know. Okay, so whatever. Um, but the idea is, um, wait, I really wanted to show this to you. I frame, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; go ahead. You, you keep looking. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, that&amp;#8217;s what it was. I totally changed this. I totally changed this. Okay, so, um, so there&amp;#8217;s no currently no menu item, but, um, because what I had changed was started doing it all in React and JavaScript, but I was like, you know what, let&amp;#8217;s just do this in, in an easier way. So like that, that whole welcome screen is actually like, you&amp;#8217;re actually hitting a button in the page, reloads. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s not the like cool Ajay way to do it, but who cares? It works. So, um, so let&amp;#8217;s see. We do actually build, Hey there. It&amp;#8217;s, so the idea being that, you know, somewhere on this screen you&amp;#8217;re like, okay, it&amp;#8217;s. [00:12:00] Ready to go or you know, here&amp;#8217;s my blog post. There&amp;#8217;s a big button somewhere. Or I had had it up here in the menu item that was like, you know, social images. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s like, okay, you&amp;#8217;re ready to go now build your social images so it takes you to a screen, um, where something like this, right, like this is a dashboard. Um, so we can actually create these things. Um, Instagram card. Right. So like you&amp;#8217;ve got things that you&amp;#8217;re building and the idea being that you&amp;#8217;re choosing a channel, which is what&amp;#8217;s, so channel being Twitter, Facebook, something like that. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Obviously we will introduce custom ones, but this is what defines the size, right? So like if it&amp;#8217;s Twitter, 1300 by 900, no, 1600 by 900, if it&amp;#8217;s Instagram, 10 80 by 10 80. Um, and then we&amp;#8217;ve also got templates. And so right now I think I [00:13:00] only have, uh, like a simple. Simple one implemented. Um, but the idea is you then it takes you to an edit screen, right? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we are on, here&amp;#8217;s my blog post. Um, and I need to, I need a name for what these are called. I don&amp;#8217;t know what they&amp;#8217;re called. Um, but you&amp;#8217;ve got, um, you know, the template that you&amp;#8217;ve started with, um, and you should be able to change this as you go. It&amp;#8217;s like, oh, right, I&amp;#8217;m no, I actually want this for Facebook or whatever. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right? And the template is, um, again, your starting point, but you&amp;#8217;ve got the idea of being that you then got whatever&amp;#8217;s customizable is this is your preview on the right. So again, here&amp;#8217;s my blog post that was pulled in from the blog post, right? If you want the featured image as the background. Well, I didn&amp;#8217;t implement that, so that&amp;#8217;s not showing, but that&amp;#8217;s what would show, you know, in the background. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What I do have implemented is, um, if you wanted to show the ti the. The date of the post. [00:14:00] Yeah. Um, right. If you wanted to add a background color, let&amp;#8217;s just make it red, right? So pretend your, you know, your featured image isn&amp;#8217;t there. You can change the font. Um, you can change the size, right? So basically, like, based off of a template you would customize, um, what this looks like. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, you know, this is obviously not an accurate representation cuz we&amp;#8217;re saying it&amp;#8217;s Instagram, but pretend it&amp;#8217;s Twitter, it&amp;#8217;s the right proportions. You&amp;#8217;ve got it customized on the right and then you, and then you&amp;#8217;d hit a button that says print essentially, you know, stamp it, create it. Whatever that looks like. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then, um, you can go back to your dashboard and we would have the preview of it, um, as it was created. And so then here, or any, anywhere there&amp;#8217;s a button that says download, you know, if it&amp;#8217;s Twitter, then you&amp;#8217;ve got a share directly to Twitter button, upload it to [00:15:00] Buffer kind of thing. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cool. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#8217;s the very clunky version. But you know, again, the, the, the walkthrough that I&amp;#8217;m starting to picture is you create a, um, anything you create in here in WordPress, a post, a page, you then have a button that says, okay, use data from this to populate a template. So it&amp;#8217;s the page title, copy excerpt. Um, You know, featured image, and then you bang through a bunch of templates, you&amp;#8217;re like, oh, there&amp;#8217;s a, the simple template that has the title on the bottom and the featured image is a background. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve got the card template that&amp;#8217;s got the featured image above and the title below. You&amp;#8217;ve got the, um, the Post Status template that, you know, you automatically inserts your logo on the left and your featured image on the right [00:16:00] with a title down below. You&amp;#8217;ve got the whatev, what&amp;#8217;s the other one we looked at? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, Freemeus template, that&amp;#8217;s got the flip art, you know, featured image on the right and the title on the left, and lots of white space, whatever, whatever. Um, you know, and you and each one, I guess I&amp;#8217;m picturing, have you used, um, migrate DB Pro from Delicious Brains years ago? Yeah. Um, So they&amp;#8217;ve got this real, you know, if you&amp;#8217;re, um, so it&amp;#8217;s, you know, migrating data from one site to another. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So you go in and you say, start a new migration, and you plug in the credentials and you plug in your settings. And so you, at any point you can say, go do the migration, push the data, pull the data, um, or you can save this as a template so that you can, you know, go in regularly and say, pull in the data from the site, pull in the data, you know, it&amp;#8217;s a new day. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pull in the n the fresh data. And so I&amp;#8217;m picturing that kind of flow where, [00:17:00] um, you know, if, if all you need is, um, if all you need is a Twitter image, then click, click, click and you&amp;#8217;ve got one. Um, but you know, while you&amp;#8217;re in here, if you&amp;#8217;ve got all this configured, there&amp;#8217;s a button that says Save this, you know, as a template for every post. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so then the next time you come in here, you know, uh, create a thing from scratch or load your. You know, send it to Corey&amp;#8217;s Twitter template, bang. And it, but again, it pulls in that post data populates your template. So it&amp;#8217;s like your, your Post Status template where it&amp;#8217;s like you&amp;#8217;d set it up once with a logo on the left and your featured image on the right, you&amp;#8217;d hit save. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the Post Status, um, you know, person profile template. And then every time you just come in, drag that down and it automatically throw it on the screen. You could tweak it a little if you needed to, if the title was too long or something, and then hit print and then you&amp;#8217;ve got that image. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cool.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; [00:18:00] So yeah, from a workflow standpoint, I think that&amp;#8217;s very, uh, understandable. But this is around like a broader question that leads back to that, um, like the open graph and things like that. So, you know, when you paste the link into Slack or you paste it into Facebook or whatever that is, Um, it&amp;#8217;s pulling some data back from the website,&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Correct . â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of it populated by something like Yost. Okay.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; So how does Slack, Facebook, different things know which particular image? Like when you create a post and then you put that image in there, there&amp;#8217;s multiple options and dimensions with the channels and stuff. So is that stored somewhere on the backend? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like if we, if someone goes, okay, I want it, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, how would that [00:19:00] automatically recognize in those platforms?&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Or does it Right? Um, yeah, we&amp;#8217;d have to look into that. Like I know that I&amp;#8217;ve, I&amp;#8217;ve played with another tool before that generated an open graph image for your blog post. Um, and. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They, I don&amp;#8217;t remember if it worked or not. I feel like it didn&amp;#8217;t work the way I wanted it to, but it, um, it hooked into Yost. So if you had Yost running, you didn&amp;#8217;t have to say, generate an image and then download an image and then upload an image into Yost. There was a way that it was like that image was saved to the media library. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then, um, and then Yost, there was a hook somewhere, I&amp;#8217;m sure in Yost, cuz they&amp;#8217;re real good about that. That said, for the social image point at this one. Or maybe they, they, you know, maybe they updated the metadata, the Yost metadata or something like that. But, [00:20:00] um, but yeah, that&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s like I, you know, this is this, like what I just showed is broadly the. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, how we generate images, right? But I think like one of the onboarding things, kind of like Yost walks you through site basics, right? Like we would have some sort of onboarding as part, you know, connect to, to screenshot express. But then like, what do you want to buy? What do, what do you want your defaults to be? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create? And it&amp;#8217;s honestly like, it would be a great, um, user onboarding because it&amp;#8217;s like, okay, we&amp;#8217;re gonna create, you know, every website full stop needs a default o OG open graph image. So let&amp;#8217;s show you our little template builder and you&amp;#8217;re gonna build your first template. You know, that&amp;#8217;s your default website homepage, open graph image. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Done, saved. [00:21:00] And then you can also save this as the default template that&amp;#8217;ll get used for every post. But instead of pulling in the name of your website, it&amp;#8217;ll pull in the name of your post done. And so if you check a box, um, then every post you create, you know, we can have it. Whenever you somehow indicate that you&amp;#8217;ve published, you&amp;#8217;re ready, then it&amp;#8217;ll automatically create that open graph image by default. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, and or, you know, any of these things we can get. I ideally you&amp;#8217;d get to a point where, um, you know, you publish a post, you click, okay, I&amp;#8217;m ready to promote it. There&amp;#8217;s a good word. Like the next stage after creating a thing, a post, a page is to promote it, market it, whatever. You know, click a click here to generate all of the images you&amp;#8217;ve already set up or add new ones or if, you know, if you wanna do it manually every time you can. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But we could, we could automate a lot of that stuff so that it&amp;#8217;s, you [00:22:00] know, cuz it, yeah, once you get down the road aways, it&amp;#8217;s like the clients that I have that are publishing articles, you know, once or twice a day, presumably they, they might, they would spot check these things, these images created, but, um, but the likely the idea, ideally the, you know, they would click a button and an OG image would be created. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And also like, if they open that dashboard screen, then it&amp;#8217;s just like, download your Twitter image, download your, or click here to, to download all of them as a zip to then send to the social media manager or something like that.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; So the reason I was asking is related back to workflow too. So you go, like, you, you hit on it. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where I was thinking there is like, there&amp;#8217;s a, there&amp;#8217;s a site specific open graph thing that just gets populated and then each post has, uh, a nuance of [00:23:00] that kind. I mean, we&amp;#8217;re kind of thinking like a thumbnail in a sense, but like for the social images, um, and back down the workflow, I almost go like, again, not knowing the technical part of this, but I go from a workflow standpoint. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You created your blog post, you start your build thing and like you don&amp;#8217;t even select a channel. It&amp;#8217;s like here&amp;#8217;s all like here&amp;#8217;s LinkedIn, here&amp;#8217;s Twitter, here&amp;#8217;s Facebook. Yes, here&amp;#8217;s Google things. And they&amp;#8217;re already there and generated not even if you&amp;#8217;re gonna like repost on LinkedIn or. Share, but like they&amp;#8217;re already generated because maybe somebody does share your image on LinkedIn, not you. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right. And you want that to show up nicely. Yeah. Um, so that was just my thought is like, first I go, oh, that&amp;#8217;s cool. He is already thought through all the channels, but then I was like, workflow wise, I just want &amp;#8217;em built for me. And maybe I&amp;#8217;m editing some of those.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. We, [00:24:00] you know, I think we define some friendly default and in an onboarding or a setup, we say, you know, by default we are creating, you know, Facebook being Facebook, they didn&amp;#8217;t name it anything. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They named it Open graph. Twitter came along second, so they have to call it a Twitter card. Um, They&amp;#8217;ll be out of business soon. So it doesn&amp;#8217;t really matter. But, um, but it&amp;#8217;s like, you know, in the onboarding, we&amp;#8217;ll say like, by default, do you want to j Auto generate Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram for each thing you create, yes or no, just toggle using a default, a sensible default. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then you can customize that template.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; So I think about this with our Slack community because it comes in and like, it never looks the way we wanted to, and I just go, okay, [00:25:00] we can talk about the user options at some point, but I go, I would want every channel, uh, reasonable channel created because you don&amp;#8217;t know if someone&amp;#8217;s gonna put that into Slack or something else. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; True, true, true.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; For the most popular networks. So like, even if you&amp;#8217;re not using it, you think about your visitors and you go, it want, you want it to show up nice and, and look nice. Um, so that was my, that&amp;#8217;s my thinking when I saw that is like, no matter what, this comes back to open graph, like how it, we create those and then they get tagged appropriately with open graph in, in that post. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, I think would be an excellent work focus. Then we could say for the product standpoint, it generates this on, you know, automatically for all the, so that your site looks professional, right? Any, you know, any edge case that&amp;#8217;s gonna happen. You&amp;#8217;ve made in the design, you know, [00:26:00] automation almost, and then post by post, they can, they can edit this, but I like that mindset because then we can say, I was, I was looking up open graph, um, as you were talking just to kind of understand that more. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, um, I saw some, some little sample images that came in. I thought, okay, there&amp;#8217;s some cool ideas here. Um, what we&amp;#8217;re doing. If, if we look at the bigger view and this, I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m really, this is tied back down to this workflow. What we&amp;#8217;re trying to accomplish is, uh, an easy way to demonstrate an image or some concept of, this is my website where I have done this thing for you. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like a presentation. And, um, some of the images, I was like, oh, there&amp;#8217;s so cool design ideas. But you think about it like, we&amp;#8217;ll go way back to product mockups and like iPhone mockups. You know how they always tilt [00:27:00] &amp;#8217;em. Mm-hmm. And I think we&amp;#8217;re trying to do here, the essence of it is we have a website we do a lot of content for. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when we present that in the social channels or wherever it is, we want people to know this is an entity, this is a brand thing. Like, it&amp;#8217;s as silly as the little iPhone mockup when it, you know, or remember those 3D book covers. It&amp;#8217;s that 3d. Same. Oh yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It&amp;#8217;s all 3D book covers you created, you know, 3D book cover of any PDF you had. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like almost in that sense. This is a website called Post or whatever. And you know, let me show you this real quick, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;but see, like this right here. See how it&amp;#8217;s got the little top shadow? Yep. I&amp;#8217;m not saying that&amp;#8217;s how we do it design wise, but the intention is like these little dots are kind of a signal of this is a website, this is, you know, even, even some of the [00:28:00] updates, like I guess that&amp;#8217;s Facebook, but you&amp;#8217;re like, those are some interesting design thoughts for the templates. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mm-hmm. But see, that kind of thinking is you just made me professional on things I hadn&amp;#8217;t even thought about. Yeah. Because you get to the other side and you see. Um, just like when we went live on Goda or YouTube, it&amp;#8217;s got the default old Post Status logo and you&amp;#8217;re like, what you really want is some semblance of branding for the website. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mm-hmm. And the content. So like this one right here kind of speaks more to the idea of what I&amp;#8217;m talking about is like, that could be a template. Like we could&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Right. Well search for right where you are, search for open graph image template, like in, in, in the Google box at the top, like, uh, image template. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Should get a bunch of stuff about [00:29:00] tags, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;but nothing too compelling. But yeah, I, I love what, where you&amp;#8217;re going. Like we could.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Like this right here is, you know, there&amp;#8217;s just a frame, like the image. Mm-hmm. I was thinking of it as like, I don&amp;#8217;t know, but there&amp;#8217;s a frame to the image we create. It&amp;#8217;s kind of like displaying, this is on my website. This is Phil website, and I&amp;#8217;m presenting it to you where like, you know, this, I mean, even the Facebook thing, this is kind of ubiquitous with like, there&amp;#8217;s a name, there&amp;#8217;s a logo. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yep. There&amp;#8217;s a, there&amp;#8217;s something here. There&amp;#8217;s an image like this, this template format. It&amp;#8217;s pretty standard. People get that. Yep. But even if you did something like logo, something like to give it a fill of this is on the web or something. Yeah, well, like the browser bar kind of thing, I guess.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, [00:30:00] and, and, and you can, I mean, my, my intention is I. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like, I don&amp;#8217;t want to, I don&amp;#8217;t want to compete with Canva, and I don&amp;#8217;t want to get into that technical, I don&amp;#8217;t wanna go that deep. Um, at least for a long time. We can&amp;#8217;t of like drag and drop, but we can. But I&amp;#8217;ve made it very, very easy to create templates. Um, and, um, and the intent is to use the, um, you know, uh, who does it, WooCommerce or, um, E D D or, um, any number of the big plugins. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can, you can copy a template out of a plugin, put it in your theme, and then it&amp;#8217;ll get incorporated into the plugin. So it&amp;#8217;s like, you know, VVA from FIUs is like, Nope, none of these templates do what I need. Um, you know, let me create my own. And so he is, he&amp;#8217;s got a little, his little robot that&amp;#8217;s, you know, pointing at. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a browser that has a screenshot of the [00:31:00] website built in, just like you said, um, or the little, you know, avatar of, of the author with their little byline, um, already built in. And, um, and incorporate those into, you know, every template that you, uh, that you create. And subsequently every screenshot of every or every social image that you create for anything. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;m on this because we&amp;#8217;ve been, like, I was just telling you I was at trying to do a frame for this, but I go, that&amp;#8217;s really what we&amp;#8217;re capturing. When you create a piece of do something, you, you package it up with a frame and then like, I&amp;#8217;m just roughing this out cause I don&amp;#8217;t have like any InDesign skills, but you go, there&amp;#8217;s a frame up here that shows like, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kind of to, to this or this one using that. And then this is just the bar [00:32:00] that says this is a package thing. Then maybe, you know, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m only diving into this cause I really think it, this could be really simple formula to start that would mm-hmm. Really greatly enhance anything I&amp;#8217;ve done. Um, okay. So site logo. Yep. Name, you know, that kind of goes up there and then, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and then down here. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We know this be meta description maybe, or something like that. Or, uh, excerpt.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Excerpt. Yep. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; But like, if you think about that from the, just these elements for a second, right? Like, we packaged that up in a way that fills like this or mm-hmm. Like, don&amp;#8217;t, we&amp;#8217;re not in the Canva game. I mean, maybe you go do that or [00:33:00] maybe you just put it in the stock image. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that goes here, we pull this from , pull that from . There&amp;#8217;s a link in there. You&amp;#8217;ve got some simple branding. Oops. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m trying to find the image to copy it. Cause I. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like that&amp;#8217;s up here â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and everybody gets to see my awesome. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But yeah, like in this, we&amp;#8217;d only have to generate something like this. Like I could think we could get this lightly styled. Very right, very lightly styled. Pull in their logo name, have the big image here, and like I think that, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I mean, gosh, that right there, Corey. Is a significant enhancement to anything most people are doing. It&amp;#8217;s not custom, like, like these we&amp;#8217;re seeing here where [00:34:00] someone, you know, has a full-time team doing this kind of stuff, but like, then we let them be creative with their own images. Hey, we&amp;#8217;re not in that game. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re in this game of packaging this content. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I mean, it&amp;#8217;s like, you know, the, the Facebook one is the, this is the frame up here. That&amp;#8217;s just the image. And this is just the title tag, headline, and description. Yep. That right there would significantly professionalize what we&amp;#8217;re doing, you know? Mm-hmm. Uh, and then we&amp;#8217;d have to stylize the, uh, generic one. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep. And that&amp;#8217;s what I was trying to illustrate with like, so what you&amp;#8217;d saw on the right of my little demo is, you know, the, the title of the blog post featured image in the back. So that&amp;#8217;s like, that&amp;#8217;s one, that&amp;#8217;s one template. Right. And this kind of [00:35:00] thing would be another, or wrapped in a browser. Um, a fake browser would be another. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And you know, so it&amp;#8217;s, and if they&amp;#8217;re simple to create, mostly done in, um, c s s, then it&amp;#8217;s just a matter of somebody, me or you, or both of us, like essentially cranking these out. I mean, we don&amp;#8217;t, we don&amp;#8217;t want to overwhelm. The point is not to have a gajillion templates, at least not to start with, but a few sensible defaults that, like you said, give gives everybody their initial leg up. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So like right out of the box, you&amp;#8217;ve got a sensible default, something to work with. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Sorry, I can&amp;#8217;t help myself. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the way, the circle logo, you can create with Crop Express. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Give your big image of background color. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; When we first started doing that, I couldn&amp;#8217;t remember how to do that. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:36:00] Yep, there you go. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I mean, even if you took the frame off. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We probably want to play with these and see how they looked in the different social platforms, but,&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; right. Well, and that&amp;#8217;s, and that&amp;#8217;s the, the joy of this. So it&amp;#8217;s, you know, so there&amp;#8217;s, right now, like I just looked, LinkedIn uses, um, Facebook&amp;#8217;s OG image, um, Instagram you can&amp;#8217;t import. And so outta the box, we&amp;#8217;re only talking about two. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re talking about Facebook&amp;#8217;s OG image and Twitter card image. So whatever their specs are. Um, and again, because it&amp;#8217;s, we&amp;#8217;re screenshotting, H T M L, it&amp;#8217;s responsive. And so presumably you can use the same mo the same template. Yeah. You know, for both. And it&amp;#8217;s like, okay, well no, I, I don&amp;#8217;t want, I don&amp;#8217;t want the, the Corey template. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I want the Corey. [00:37:00] Template. It doesn&amp;#8217;t work. Our names are the same. I don&amp;#8217;t want the, the Corey template, I want the Miller template. And that one&amp;#8217;s got a black background. You know, it&amp;#8217;s black on white, so it&amp;#8217;s like your themes on the right there, it&amp;#8217;s like one is black on white, one is white on black, one is gray with, you know, little colors on it. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, and so you&amp;#8217;re like, that&amp;#8217;s what all of my images look like for every post I create. It automatically creates a, um, Facebook or an OG image and a Twitter image. Um, as soon as I hit publish or even before, if I click a button and say, generate based on what&amp;#8217;s, you know, the information that&amp;#8217;s here. Um, and then like you said, as soon as somebody shares it, drops it into Slack, um, shares it via Twitter, Facebook, whatever, like, it&amp;#8217;ll, it&amp;#8217;ll pull in those, the image you want that&amp;#8217;s been generated that is more than just your featured image. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then, yeah, we get into this kind of stuff where it&amp;#8217;s like, [00:38:00] what are all of the d you know, these, this is where I guess the channels thing comes in, right? Like, so a channel could not only be, um, you know, technically, like Instagram is a, is a channel, but Instagram has stories which are a vertical 16 by nine to traditional Instagram, which is square. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, you know, you can, you can share horizontal, vertical, or square on Twitter, LinkedIn Carousel is gonna have their own thing. Um, you know, what&amp;#8217;s, what&amp;#8217;s the optimal, you&amp;#8217;re in Google Slides, what&amp;#8217;s the optimal Google slide? Size and shape, like, so we can. Basically that&amp;#8217;s where we once, once we have the, the way to present templates, we can go crazy creating templates for every single channel and every, every scenario. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah,&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; I was just [00:39:00] thinking too, the option where you don&amp;#8217;t have an image, but it creates one, an open graph type image for you. Mm-hmm. And what you want.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Um, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;well, and this is where we, um, um, we had talked about too, like, uh, you could have a template that looks at the content of the story for anything that&amp;#8217;s in a block quote and pulls out the first block quote or pulls out every block quote and, and generates an image for each of those quotes. So now you&amp;#8217;ve got. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve got three block quotes, you&amp;#8217;ve now got three images that are all sized and stylized for Twitter. And so then you say, okay, post this one today, this one tomorrow, and this one on Thursday â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; capture. This is just me capturing this. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like yeah. Even if it hadn&amp;#8217;t open quote, like you don&amp;#8217;t really have an image, but you have a powerful quote in [00:40:00] here. CSS can use some brain, like whatever your default site right is. Yeah.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Then it pull. I love that. You know, some basic styling. It&amp;#8217;s pulling in your, I mean, Mo um, WordPress Customizer has a place for a logo so we can reach for it there, and otherwise we can say, specify a logo to use across all your templates. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, And it&amp;#8217;ll auto-populate. And then you can obviously drill down and, and customize each one as you, as you mess with it. Um, oras or mess with it as much as you want to. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so, um, so backing up, up, up, I&amp;#8217;m creating a system for customizing a couple of templates to start with manually. And your, [00:41:00] let&amp;#8217;s start with featured image kind of comment here to me, which I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m a hundred percent on board with, is the ability to set one of those essentially as a default so that it&amp;#8217;s auto-generated so that the moment you hit publish your story has a handsome OG image. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#8217;ll see about hooking that into Yost or what have you. And then we can continue to take it further. Cuz it&amp;#8217;s like, yeah, let&amp;#8217;s, let&amp;#8217;s at least cover the basics base. Let&amp;#8217;s cover the bases. Me and my sports metaphors. You&amp;#8217;re that guy. Um, let&amp;#8217;s at least do the basic of generating an an OG image, um, which is for better or worse, is the couple of other plug-ins or products that I&amp;#8217;ve seen. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s where they start. Um, but they also end there. So it&amp;#8217;s like, great, let&amp;#8217;s take it further than that of generating a Twitter card [00:42:00] image, but then also any other image you want. The, the workflow will start to get a little clunky because you are going to have to do something with those images. Upload them to buffer or. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Upload them manually to Twitter or whatever, but at least those images exist, at least based off of, um, WordPress post data and a template. A template or templates that you&amp;#8217;ve presumably built once and then said, save you can, the next time you publish a post, you hit, generate all these images, download a zip, and then you&amp;#8217;re not, you don&amp;#8217;t have to go to Canva and you don&amp;#8217;t have to tweak, tweak, tweak or copy, you know, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, and tweak and insert your own data and stuff. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#8217;re just, they&amp;#8217;re just there. Yeah.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, like, uh, sorry, I, I was thinking too, here, here&amp;#8217;s where I&amp;#8217;m going with this too, is [00:43:00] I would imagine if we can create a, you know, my site, let&amp;#8217;s say has 500 posts on there with no social images. Ooh. See where I&amp;#8217;m going? Yeah. Install and it gives you a base, nicely styled, professional enough thing that can go backwards. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yep. Oh, now you&amp;#8217;ve just made shit ton of work. Extremely easy and increased their professionalism. So what I was just doing was thinking about the Sitewide thing. It&amp;#8217;s like it&amp;#8217;s just a simple business card, you know? Yep. Here&amp;#8217;s the logo, here&amp;#8217;s the site, here&amp;#8217;s our tagline. Like that might be it. Yep. Just what we&amp;#8217;ve done, but we&amp;#8217;ve hundred Xed this thing that exists that, you know, you go to all these sites and you&amp;#8217;re like, God, they&amp;#8217;ve got a whole team doing this stuff. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mm-hmm. We just hadn&amp;#8217;t gone, boom, there&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; value, man. Oh, huge. And that&amp;#8217;s [00:44:00] like, that to me is, um, Uh, another Delicious Brain&amp;#8217;s product, the Offload s3. Um, and the free version lets you start today. The pro version among other things, lets you go, go back and essentially catch up.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; See, and that&amp;#8217;s killer. I mean, imagine all these, okay, now we&amp;#8217;ve hit our huge value prop because imagine all the WordPress website maintenance companies that go, by the way, we noticed your, your site is just not displaying too professionally. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re gonna install this and click it and it&amp;#8217;s done. Yep. Holy shit.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; I mean, and even, even taking that a little further, like if I&amp;#8217;m. Excuse me, I&amp;#8217;m the agency. I come in or I&amp;#8217;m the developer. I come in, I&amp;#8217;m like, you know, yeah, I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m building this thing for [00:45:00] you, but, um, we&amp;#8217;re updating this thing for you. But like you said, I&amp;#8217;ve noticed that, you know, a lot of these old pages don&amp;#8217;t have these images, whatever. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, I come in and I set styles. It&amp;#8217;s like, what&amp;#8217;s, what&amp;#8217;s, like you said, what&amp;#8217;s your logo? What&amp;#8217;s your, um, brand colors? What&amp;#8217;s your, you know, and so then it&amp;#8217;s um, it&amp;#8217;s all on brand too. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s all on brand. And then like I meant any B2B site, so when it shows up, they might go â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;like right there. They put incredible fingertip address. Like all the addresses. I mean, this is just nothing but a business card for your website, right? I&amp;#8217;m gonna capture that for marketing. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Um, and then, and then [00:46:00] WooCommerce, right? So, so every, every product you already have on your website, it just goes back through and, and populates and you know it, like we&amp;#8217;ve said pre in a, in a previous call, um, you know, product image, bullet points. You probably don&amp;#8217;t wanna do price, but you know, if you&amp;#8217;ve got an if, if each of your products has bullet points or has reviews. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So picture of image. Title of em or title of product, sorry, picture of product, title of product, 400 reviews, five stars and an excerpt. This widget is the best widget, you know, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;what do you do? What do you see? If[00:47:00]&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I go to Amazon, I want share this backpack, copy link. I go over to Post Status. I can find Corey. I say, this is the backpack I&amp;#8217;m looking at. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What does it do? What does it do? Apparently nothing. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It just takes something to populate. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nothing. I feel like maybe slack&amp;#8217;s being slow or something. Oops. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okay. So do you wanna share your window or all? No, I don&amp;#8217;t have anything to share. I was just seeing, I, I went and grabbed a URL from Amazon and pasted it into Post Status. Um, To you to see what it would populate with, but it [00:48:00] didn&amp;#8217;t actually populate anything. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Um, you know, a basic business card for your website basically is what we&amp;#8217;re doing. And then the on top of that is, you know, something like this, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; right? Yeah, exactly. And that&amp;#8217;s what I mean by like, so part of the onboarding, which I think would be great cuz it helps people get set up is, you know, upload a logo or specify where a logo is. I mean, Yost does the same thing. Um, and, and so you, you, it&amp;#8217;ll, it&amp;#8217;ll give you the data points that it&amp;#8217;ll give us the data, give the plugin the data points that it needs to build a sensible default. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, and so much. And then that&amp;#8217;s your starting point for, you know, every time you wanna share, share a post, you know, start here. Well, no, this one actually [00:49:00] has a, a featured image. Let&amp;#8217;s put that in. Or, you know, if it&amp;#8217;s a, uh, you know, this is your business card for your website, but then, you know, it&amp;#8217;s a woo commerce shop, so you actually want products. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s like, then you&amp;#8217;d say, okay, we&amp;#8217;ll copy this, this business card template, but then, you know, add, show the featured image or something â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and doing,&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; I mean, doing that, cross the website, um, huge, like 10 times better than what you have. A hundred times better than you have just with some basic, like I&amp;#8217;m talk I, when I did the Google search with the business card, I said, simple, modern business card. That&amp;#8217;s your favicon, or you upload your own little image. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You got, that&amp;#8217;s your site title, that&amp;#8217;s your site tagline. Maybe that&amp;#8217;s edible. And then you add in your little information. I mean,&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah. [00:50:00] Yeah. And, and the default, you know, is all of these sites will go and grab, you know, ideally there&amp;#8217;s an OG image, and so you are creating one in Canva and reimporting it, um, or you, um, or it&amp;#8217;s trying to grab the first image on the page. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So usually that&amp;#8217;s the featured image. It&amp;#8217;s like, like we said, you know what, what kind of started this whole conversation a month ago now between you and I is the, like, better than a featured image put, put some bullet points on it, put the title, put the, you know, um, whatever, whatever, whatever other data points you can add so that when they share it, it&amp;#8217;s not just an image. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An abstract image. Oh, it&amp;#8217;s a widget. It&amp;#8217;s like, oh no, it&amp;#8217;s a widget that has these benefits. Buy it on this website.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; So an over graph question is, we we&amp;#8217;re talking about generating the HTML snapshot and then making it, or [00:51:00] across the site, but we do have the h html sitting there too. Mm-hmm. I don&amp;#8217;t know how Op grf does that, but, but for what looks like, it seems like it&amp;#8217;s an image, but I mean, we still have the H M L code code rendered somewhere. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yep. Okay. So this right here. Oh, I just wanted to go down there to see. Okay. There&amp;#8217;s something here. Basically the value prop is overnight flesh out in a more professional manner. Your open graph, social distributions, I mean, I&amp;#8217;d go back to something like this if I don&amp;#8217;t have a featured image, which I don&amp;#8217;t on most of my blog posts, and, um, it&amp;#8217;ll just pull a simple image that looks a little, it&amp;#8217;s a treatment. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like we&amp;#8217;ve been talking about the images. What are you truly trying to do is just show its image. [00:52:00] And if you set your defaults, like having, you know, you&amp;#8217;re like, whatever, you&amp;#8217;re, were yellow or were orange. So â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;we probably don&amp;#8217;t wanna do that, but, um Right. You know, right there. Mm-hmm. You just made something a little nicer.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Or your, you know, logo. Logo in the top right. Or, um, you know, if there isn&amp;#8217;t a featured or, you know, and so if there&amp;#8217;s a featured image, it shows up. If there isn&amp;#8217;t, you have at least got your logo. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, you know, and or the option to, um, We could even have an option that says like, if you don&amp;#8217;t have a featured image, just do a big old logo. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. Like, uh, you know, the ultimate guide to social images, you knows the headline, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:53:00] you know, there&amp;#8217;s that option and stuff like that. Anyway, I think there&amp;#8217;s a lot here. All that to say Yep. That with the premise of open, we know it is open graph, but it&amp;#8217;s probably not the marking side, but it&amp;#8217;s like, um, instantly create a more professional open graph presence for your entire site. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Something better, like these will be images too. And so like, so in that if programmatically we could say that. It&amp;#8217;ll pull your featured image into these, you know, spots and we&amp;#8217;re saving that image that automatically puts an image back into that post, right? Mm-hmm.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh yeah, we could do that. So use this as featured image gen generate better image replaced featured image. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; I mean, it&amp;#8217;s kinda like the 3D book cover. Those were just generated cuz it was all digital assets. So they wanted a visual way to [00:54:00] do that in the same sample, doing that&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; software too. Remember they start, they would show a box like you&amp;#8217;d buy at Staples, but you couldn&amp;#8217;t actually walk into Staples and buy it. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Album covers T-shirts. Yeah. I mean there&amp;#8217;s, and, and there&amp;#8217;s good examples online. There&amp;#8217;s lots of little apps now that, um, you can build, um, Build the screenshots or take, take a screenshot and it puts it in a browser and puts it at a tilt, like you said. Um, like we&amp;#8217;d have to play with all that. But, um, put it in a browser wrapper, put it on an iPhone, have somebody smiling and holding it on their iPhone. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, um, yeah. All those things. Like we can, again, once, once we&amp;#8217;ve got the template builder, essentially then our imagination, as long as we can do it in H T M L, then we can create a template that does that and people can build their own too, which is what I really like. Cuz you&amp;#8217;re, [00:55:00] you&amp;#8217;re gonna have nerds like me who will look at, um, look at a couple of hours simple templates and go, oh, cool. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let me, let me go build my own specific to my website, my own branding, or, you know, I. Yeah, because, and then we created Marketplace and people could sell the templates and take, get a commission. We&amp;#8217;ll go crazy baby.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I was just trying to skip this out of, okay, the, this all seems valuable to people, uh, to me, and I think it would be, should be to other people. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then, like you said, it, well, I mean, one is creating an open graph image for each post. Um, sitewide in each post, what we have here. I didn&amp;#8217;t, you know, there&amp;#8217;s another benefit that we talked about. It&amp;#8217;s like, well, like for my site would instantly get a bunch of thumbnails or, you know, the book [00:56:00] cover type treatment. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, then you&amp;#8217;ve just told the search engines, I&amp;#8217;ve got new image content. Mm. You&amp;#8217;ve, you&amp;#8217;ve made an update to existing posts, you know? Yep. So, That&amp;#8217;s my, maybe part three or something, but, or I don&amp;#8217;t even know. But, um, I just see that value going. Oh. Cuz you can show, people are tired of seeing, you know, crap. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, you&amp;#8217;re doing all this content work, but you&amp;#8217;re tired of seeing the social distribution, open graph stuff look like crap. This solves that problem with a click. Yep. So that&amp;#8217;s why I wanted to go down this of like, where, I mean, this right here, there&amp;#8217;s a pot of gold here. I mean, if you don&amp;#8217;t, if you have great content in the past, but you don&amp;#8217;t really have a lot of the strong image stuff, then use, use these two. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yep. You know, like the table of contents [00:57:00] plug in. Mm-hmm. It&amp;#8217;ll auto generate something and then, you know, you click, click that&amp;#8217;s made, it&amp;#8217;ll pull it and then you go, yeah, sa saved whatever it is. And then now you&amp;#8217;ve added an image. Image search is what we talked about last time. Image search to a blog post with a little bit of, with some automation here. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s really cool. Um, yeah. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With, you know, not a, doesn&amp;#8217;t seem like a ton of work for the user side. Um, maybe there&amp;#8217;s a, you know, an option here per post, which is use the excerpt, use the first block quote, find the H two s, the list or something, you know what I mean? Mm-hmm. And then you just, cuz I was trying to think from em, image&amp;#8217;s, search for a [00:58:00] second, you go, um, that&amp;#8217;s another way to get search engine traffic and visibility for your brand. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I mean, summarize it. Look, this is, we had this conversation a couple weeks ago. Summarize your content with this kind of â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. The tldr. Yeah.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; So for the template engine, I wanted to get all this cuz it&amp;#8217;s like, well these are all the ingredients that we could potentially want. So that, you know, when you start building it, like, okay, I need to, maybe for an image you can, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;uh, you know, pull, pull H two s, you know. Mm-hmm. Pull the first block, quote and that auto populates in here. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okay. Thank you for going all the way down there. Now back to this. Does this give some more fleshed out detail to the [00:59:00] template workflow? The. Workflow conversation.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I&amp;#8217;m trying to think of where to start. Um, I think that the workflow that I&amp;#8217;m working on still, still works. I think we start with posts, um, and then we can implement like the sitewide version using whatever we&amp;#8217;ve defined. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cuz it&amp;#8217;s like, to me, the post paradigm is ex the example that we will then implement everywhere. Um, so we can basically take whatever little builder I design and stick it back in the welcome. So it&amp;#8217;s like, you know, okay, connect to your, connect your account, let&amp;#8217;s create your site business card. Do you wanna then use this for all all posts? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Do you wanna then. You know, generate, [01:00:00] generate business cards for each post retroactively. And then do you wanna get into social images? This is kind of cool cuz it&amp;#8217;s like, we&amp;#8217;re not even, in my mind it was, it was about social. Um, like I said, I&amp;#8217;d even, you know, the sort of code name for this project for me was social images. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m writing a post and then I&amp;#8217;m generating an image for Twitter or Facebook, et cetera. But we&amp;#8217;re now talking about like, there&amp;#8217;s so much other value before we even get to social. Technically. I mean, it&amp;#8217;s all technically social cuz it&amp;#8217;s about if you&amp;#8217;re sharing a post, um, than it, than it pulls in the, the featured image or what the OG image. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, um, that&amp;#8217;s all, it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s great cuz it&amp;#8217;s all, you&amp;#8217;re covering your bases of incoming traffic and then you can go do your outbound marketing. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shields are up and then you fire the torpedoes. Yeah.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; It seems [01:01:00] like, okay. Start with the sidewalk, like you said. And there&amp;#8217;s an option just to make that at the beginning, to make that if no social link or something is there, use this option, then you&amp;#8217;ve professionalized your site. Um, then you could do the per post â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Option.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; And then give us all your money if you want to go to do the past ones and or the Woo commerce add-on and or. A hundred other things. We haven&amp;#8217;t, you know, the, the marketing kit generator. So it automatically spits out Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, you know, one click generate, one click download, upload it to buffer, you know, buffer integration, um, or whatever, whatever you use to, [01:02:00] to schedule your social posts. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, all those are even before getting to the post, you could say like this, just generate it through everything on the site. So there is an open graph. Mm-hmm. Image. Then when you want to tweak per post product page, whatever that is, there&amp;#8217;s maybe in post tweaking options where we can say, update from generic, there&amp;#8217;s a fallback to the site wide, and then as you want, you come in here and then we could look at which ones we do. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We do first.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep. But I like the idea of a sensible default. I was like, I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m picturing again, like one of my sites, client sites is a magazine that&amp;#8217;s been online for 12 years. So m half the half the posts, um, um, so many of the posts have images, random sizes and things like that. [01:03:00] Um, but they&amp;#8217;ve all at least got a title and an image and a publish date. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of that&amp;#8217;s not true, but you know, like you could say, okay, so if somebody for whatever reason, shares a post from 10 years ago, it still looks basically good. Better than it, than, than it looks now where it&amp;#8217;s just a random featured image. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; See, I mean, Okay, so in that you go, here&amp;#8217;s this one for just the site. And then when you go to post, you&amp;#8217;re like, maybe it&amp;#8217;s some treatment like this. Like if there&amp;#8217;s a featured image, don&amp;#8217;t do the generic pull in featured image. Yep. And God, I gotta believe Corey, that the premise is if you can just make your site look professional with a click, and I think that [01:04:00] this, this right here would be the way to start. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Like a default, A default image with an option to apply to. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then, you know, if there&amp;#8217;s a featured image in that post, go ahead and create a thumb, you know, a featured image thing. God. Right. So with that, my hypothesis would be â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;start here with, and if we can get the applied to all posts that&amp;#8217;s worth a hundred dollars, like instantly, think about how long you&amp;#8217;d have to go to update every post. But in one click you could essentially set a very nice, we&amp;#8217;d have to land the design, you know, just a really nice modern looking design, but like in one click that&amp;#8217;s not worth a hundred dollars, update your open graph. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right. [01:05:00] With, and even here, we&amp;#8217;ve said if, if, if a post, if post has featured image, you know, use it with X template. Mm-hmm. If you got that out, like for, for right now, my, my value pro for Post Status would be Yeah. You know? Right. Yeah. Um, then if we wanted to going forward, we could, we could look at for Post Status as a client. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okay. Now, ongoing, um, when V2 hits, you know, select an image right there in the post block quote,&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; uh, freeform. Yeah. I&amp;#8217;m picturing, um, a screen. It&amp;#8217;s like if we, if we can, you know, we&amp;#8217;re, we&amp;#8217;re totally blue, blue skying here. It&amp;#8217;s like, but it&amp;#8217;s, you know, generate image. I wanna generate a bunch of images. [01:06:00] A screen opens up that says, um, looks like it has a featured image. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looks like it has a couple of images in line, so check, check, check. So that&amp;#8217;s three. Looks like it has block quotes, you know, two block quotes. Do you want to use them? I&amp;#8217;ll you say this one and not this one, you know? And so it&amp;#8217;s like, now generate, and that&amp;#8217;s fi you know, it just spits out five, five different images and you go, oh yeah, I like this one and this one, you know, that they, it, it fits together well. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, you know, but I think we can, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;with some degree of reliability, we can, we can, we can at least try to pull stuff out. Like we featured Image for sure. Title for sure. Excerpt for sure. Um, I like your idea of, of essentially looking at H two s, um, creating an outline. And so, you know, they could just say, yep, that outline works, that&amp;#8217;s accurate or it&amp;#8217;s not. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, block quotes are easy cuz they&amp;#8217;re surrounded by, if they&amp;#8217;re done right, they&amp;#8217;re H T M L, you know, [01:07:00] it&amp;#8217;s an actual block quote tag. Um, and so they can, they can basically just, you know, we say, here&amp;#8217;s your template. And then here&amp;#8217;s all the elements from the page that we&amp;#8217;ve detected, and you can add your own too, you know, now click a button to sort of put them together. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Man, I really,&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; I really like this. I feel, I feel, when we talked about crop express, it was a thing, a utility thing. We thought we needed. We know we needed, and we think hypothesis. Everybody probably needs this mostly, and thi but that was a very tiny detail in a process, right? We just got in a workflow process. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We just got to a whole site value prop. Um, like just, just right here, [01:08:00] right now, my question would be, do we, do you. We&amp;#8217;re doing this from a SaaS that you&amp;#8217;ve already built in the, in the back. Like it has to take the information, send it over, snapshot it, send it back, right. It&amp;#8217;s almost a blend. Like the plugin in some sense might be some of the design stuff, but it&amp;#8217;s a plugin with a SaaS component to it. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right. Um, I don&amp;#8217;t know if that makes it easier, harder, whatever,&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; but, right. Well, I mean my, yeah, my, the way I&amp;#8217;d set this stuff up originally was I was like, you know, there&amp;#8217;s an API over there that obviously your average person doesn&amp;#8217;t know about, but you can put any product you want in front of it. And like, I&amp;#8217;m basically just running like a water company, electric company utility. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like, I don&amp;#8217;t care if you&amp;#8217;re running a blender or an air conditioner, I&amp;#8217;m just selling you electricity. [01:09:00] So my intention originally was, To just, I, you know, here&amp;#8217;s this thing, it generates screenshots and then build all these little apps in front of it, or you can build your own. Um, and I just charge for screen, you know, per screenshot. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;trying to think of, I mean, so it&amp;#8217;s like you look at, um, awesome motives. Optin Monster comes to mind. You know, they are a SaaS that technically works without the WordPress plugin, but it&amp;#8217;s really 99% designed to run with the WordPress plugin, um, for WordPress. And so you pay for a number of impressions or a number of campaigns or, I don&amp;#8217;t remember what, what it is, but it&amp;#8217;s something like that. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I think we would definitely want to. We&amp;#8217;ll have to think about that, right? Because it&amp;#8217;s like the number of, if we [01:10:00] go with my model, it&amp;#8217;s very abstracted. Um, you know, it&amp;#8217;s per image generated, but you don&amp;#8217;t want somebody to sit there and go, oh, well, if I generate one more picture, you know, or if I tweak it and then regenerate and tweak it and regenerate, like, Ooh, did I spend it an eighth of a penny? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like, you don&amp;#8217;t want people worrying about that. So, um, you know, some, some general, but I, again, I, I control the, the water supply. Um, so we can do it in a way that. You know, you get, you get a thousand images or it&amp;#8217;s per post or per channels, or like, we can do something that makes a lot more sense for the end user or makes sense to the end user without being as technical as, you know, per image generated May, and maybe that is what we want. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know, but we can, we can kind of do what we want. Um, the, the downside is, I don&amp;#8217;t have a lot of information yet [01:11:00] about how much it actually costs, um, per, because I&amp;#8217;ve, I&amp;#8217;ve generated images for myself in a small quantity, you know, but at scale, I don&amp;#8217;t know yet.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, could we, could we, and I think we should use Post Status, uh, for sure. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s wide open. There&amp;#8217;s no worries there. And I can, I&amp;#8217;ll give you a discount Post Status can pay for that, but I go, I. I want this on Post Status. Um, right. Then we go like, look what we did, we just overnight with one click essentially, um, created here, here&amp;#8217;s what I don&amp;#8217;t know from the technical side. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So like if we said just you create in there one time the open graph image. Okay. Go back for the entire site, it comes back. This is the default. That&amp;#8217;s one image. Right? Right now I don&amp;#8217;t know what the option for like [01:12:00] just that default business card image here. That&amp;#8217;s one image. Yep. The setting could be, um, you know, apply this one image across site. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I. I mean, that&amp;#8217;s just saying programmatically in WordPress, that one image in your image library right now attaches No, the default open group across the database. Am I on track there?&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Correct. Because yeah, if we do it, um, so that the image comes back and you are hosting it, what do we care? So it, it, we have to pay for a few CPU cycles. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; So there&amp;#8217;s that without getting pricing or whatever, but I just go that, yeah, I would, I want that today from post tennis. I want. Okay. Yeah. [01:13:00] Then we, we could say, we could use Post Status with, I don&amp;#8217;t know, thousands of articles, but, um, okay. Take most of these, a lot of these posts probably have a featured image in it on our site. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yep. And then run that. I would pay the bill post us would pay the bill for that. Now create and just see what kind of thing we&amp;#8217;re looking sure at. You&amp;#8217;ve got a third here. I added though, is like, it&amp;#8217;s one thing to do the feature, just an open graph image, but that&amp;#8217;s not saying crop it for Twitter, Facebook. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So each post can have five different images. Right.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; And that&amp;#8217;s, and that&amp;#8217;s where it, it gets, I think it, it, it may get tricky for the end user to understand cuz also they&amp;#8217;re like, okay, I&amp;#8217;ve generated images. If I share my page, I see one of those images. But where it lives [01:14:00] somewhere in the media library. But you&amp;#8217;re also showing me these, these other thumbnails. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One&amp;#8217;s a square that says Instagram under it, but it&amp;#8217;s not on Instagram. Like, what, what do I do with this? You know? And so like, what, that might be a little tricky. Um, that&amp;#8217;s not what you&amp;#8217;re talking about, but that&amp;#8217;s, but to me that&amp;#8217;s, you know, that&amp;#8217;s the bigger product that we&amp;#8217;re talking about is like, I, I kind of like the phrase of like media kit generator, where it&amp;#8217;s like for each post create five different images and they, and download them as a zip. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so you get a zip file that, um, you know, or I mean, we can have a page click here to open your media kit for this post and you see all those images and there&amp;#8217;s a download button or again, a share out button or what have you. Um, but yeah, each, each post, that&amp;#8217;s, that&amp;#8217;s the thing right? Is um, As it&amp;#8217;s exponential. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s per post, or it&amp;#8217;s, or it&amp;#8217;s each [01:15:00] post. And then however many you want per post. And if, and if each post you wanna have, and this is, this is probably not a retroactive thing, um, but it&amp;#8217;s like I write a post today. I want Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. I want three different versions. Say they&amp;#8217;re three block quotes. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So Facebook times three, Twitter times three, Instagram times three, you know, same, same treatment, but block quote, block quote, block quote. And so I&amp;#8217;m like, okay, because I wanna schedule this to go to tweet today, tomorrow, and the next day. Like that&amp;#8217;s a proper marketing campaign around a post, a new post. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#8217;s nine social images. Plus open graph. So that&amp;#8217;s 10 per post. And that&amp;#8217;s where it starts to get exponential, you know? Um, not a bad thing. I mean, and these aren&amp;#8217;t expensive cuz [01:16:00] we&amp;#8217;re, we&amp;#8217;re using, you know, cloud computing as you&amp;#8217;d expect. But that&amp;#8217;s where it&amp;#8217;s, it might get complicated. Like we need to think about like per channel or per variation, or maybe it just is per image generated per post, or maybe it&amp;#8217;s just per, it is per, you know, it&amp;#8217;s like okay, every, every post is, you know, uh, 10 cents and you get 10 images per post. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cuz I, I, I can&amp;#8217;t imagine that we&amp;#8217;re paying a penny per image at the end of the day. Especially if we push it all back to their media library. We&amp;#8217;re not hosting it, so it doesn&amp;#8217;t, it shouldn&amp;#8217;t cost us anything to ho you know, to ongoing disk space. At some point, we&amp;#8217;ll, we&amp;#8217;ll delete old images that aren&amp;#8217;t getting used or something, but, you know, we say, But how, how you bill for 10 cents. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cuz also there&amp;#8217;s this, like, one of the things that I wanted to do when I created Screenshot Express initially, I just, I like the [01:17:00] idea, you know, as we&amp;#8217;ve talked about in, um, previous sessions, we don&amp;#8217;t, we don&amp;#8217;t need this. And so we don&amp;#8217;t need, you know, this is, this is fun for us, this is a pursuit for us, but it&amp;#8217;s not, you know, do or die. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so it&amp;#8217;s like, I want to, I want to take every opportunity to like play with conventions. And so part of the thing that, you know, always bugs me about various services, there&amp;#8217;s is there&amp;#8217;s Ford developers, there&amp;#8217;s the pay per cycle, pay per whatever. Um, And then there&amp;#8217;s the other ones that are like, you pay a hundred dollars and you get a hundred things, and if you then need 101, we mark, we bump you up to the next payment tier. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, and that bothers me because it&amp;#8217;s like, well, I, what if I only use 80, then I just gave you money, or the price per thing went up. Um, but the inverse, especially for a lot of non-technical people or in a lot of non-business [01:18:00] thinking people is like, gulp, I don&amp;#8217;t want to pay a dollar per thing because what if somebody hacks my site and uses us out a thousand things that just cost me a thousand dollars. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, and so somewhere in the middle is this like, you know, pay for blocks or, um, you know, like there&amp;#8217;s some friendly way to Yeah. Um, have variable pricing without it, with, you know, with sanity checks or something like that. So I. And I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m way overthinking it. The truth is, is we&amp;#8217;re gonna end up just charging $99, you know, for a thousand images per, per month. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, and we can, we can kind of gauge that when we set it up, we&amp;#8217;re like, oh, it looks like you have a thousand blog posts, and so we&amp;#8217;re gonna put you in the thousand dollars tier or whatever, you know, whatever. It&amp;#8217;s,&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; um, so it, it, it, it occurs to me for a second just to tuck this through because [01:19:00] No, that&amp;#8217;s, you&amp;#8217;re not overthinking that. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think you&amp;#8217;re making sure if you play this out, what that looks like and there&amp;#8217;s some decisions to be made, which are good. I think so. But like, okay. There&amp;#8217;s functionality probably, like I can go to Canva and create an open one, default open graph image. Now applying that across my site is functionality. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know if it exists. Or if it does, right?&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Like you&amp;#8217;d need something like, you&amp;#8217;d need something like Yost, but you are, you&amp;#8217;re, you&amp;#8217;re plugging in one image. Yeah. Maybe technically two. I think they give you Facebook and Twitter, â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;but that&amp;#8217;s definitely, that&amp;#8217;s the easy free onboarding for sure. Yeah. And then I, I honestly think that we, we build this, we run it against Post Status. We run it against my client&amp;#8217;s site. We look at the bills, and two things are gonna [01:20:00] happen. One, we&amp;#8217;re gonna know what our costs are, and two, we will have the experience of using it and go, oh, if, if I didn&amp;#8217;t know better, I would expect to pay for this, this way. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And just, you know, and ju it&amp;#8217;ll just be like, oh, right, it should be 20 bucks. Month, build monthly.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Now, as I, as I thought about that, I don&amp;#8217;t, I don&amp;#8217;t know, I&amp;#8217;ll have to go back to Yos, but I go the ability to take any image I have, whether OMG does this or not, but apply it across the site. And it&amp;#8217;s probably not one, it&amp;#8217;s three. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like we&amp;#8217;re talking about, it&amp;#8217;s Google showing up, it&amp;#8217;s Facebook, Twitter, you know, so there&amp;#8217;s, there&amp;#8217;s four images to say or something. Now two and I, huh? â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; There really is only two cuz every, I&amp;#8217;m I, as far as I know, everybody [01:21:00] uses open graph image. Twitter&amp;#8217;s the only one that&amp;#8217;s broken away. Uh oh. Like I just Googled, you know, uh, LinkedIn open graph. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the article that comes up says, make your website shareable on LinkedIn. And it says below are the OG tags. And it&amp;#8217;s just, Facebook&amp;#8217;s OG tags. So LinkedIn just uses, use it, not just, but LinkedIn uses the same as Facebook.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Then let me, here&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;m thinking. This could just, this functionality No, no. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Create an image, but just a plug in type functionality of see this image, apply it, cross the site to blogs, to everything on my site so that it&amp;#8217;s my reference sensation of my site. If it doesn&amp;#8217;t have other, other things that feels like that could be a [01:22:00] free, free option. A hundred percent. And that&amp;#8217;s valuable to, um, just going, yeah, I went to Camba, I got all my outputs, I wanna put &amp;#8217;em in and I just wanna say, apply that to my site so that instantly everything looks better if it&amp;#8217;s generic. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okay. But that&amp;#8217;s like probably a free option for us. Now where I go value though, is right here of I value all of my posts. Not having the generic, but having a minimal treatment. Generat an image for that post that has, if it has a featured image, put a featured image over here. Right. Something like that. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;See, that&amp;#8217;s interesting to me. I think that&amp;#8217;s what we should play with and figure out that. Mm-hmm. Because I go, I want that today and if it costs me $500, I&amp;#8217;d do it. Hmm. If, if basic like, think about doing that [01:23:00] from cama, it&amp;#8217;s gonna take you a month. Oh yeah. Uploading, creating images, downloading and all this stuff. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#8217;s worth easily $500 for me today of any post on the site has this kind of image treatment with a click. And it&amp;#8217;s in the appropriate image graph now. Just told Google and my media library is under these pages or new images. I&amp;#8217;ve just updated my content. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yep. Like now I&amp;#8217;m kind of thinking Corey, like that&amp;#8217;s some version of, this is actually B one that&amp;#8217;s free, but, but this could be, you know, a small, I&amp;#8217;m guessing small free plugin. Upload your image. It&amp;#8217;s applied generically through your site with some real simple, you know, business card template, but this, or use cam [01:24:00] and just put it up there. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is powerful to me because I go every,&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; it&amp;#8217;s a huge time saver. That&amp;#8217;s the, yeah. Time and money, right is, yeah. Like you said, we&amp;#8217;re, we&amp;#8217;re, if you&amp;#8217;re auto generating, And especially if you&amp;#8217;re auto generating in bulk. Yeah. Okay, let&amp;#8217;s sign off. I&amp;#8217;ll go build it. Okay. I&amp;#8217;ll have it to you in 15 minutes. Just kidding. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Do you have an auto generate button for that? Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s called chat. G p t.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Uh, yeah. Hey, that&amp;#8217;s valuable. Um, what do I need to be thinking about for that? Because I&amp;#8217;m trying to put, I have the post that it&amp;#8217;s head on, but like, okay. What would I want is to be able to go through auto generate headline, an expert excerpt. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If it has a featured image, put it on there [01:25:00] for each post and be at in my media library attached to my post. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I mean, that&amp;#8217;s, that&amp;#8217;s a lot of value. Am I missing something here? Like I go mm-hmm. Something with a button click. You could pretty much create new images packaged, um, in a way. And then telling Google in the net social networks, this now exists for this piece of content. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m having a hard time saying, why wouldn&amp;#8217;t I want that right now? Like I&amp;#8217;ve right for some money, I&amp;#8217;ve instantly updated and created new content for every post on my site. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#8217;s. I know themes used the featured image, but we, we&amp;#8217;d wanna be careful replacing the featured image. But you go like, a lot of the themes have those, well, like the Frames blog have those little, well, you know, [01:26:00] a lot of sites don&amp;#8217;t even have that.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; The hero. Yep.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; The hero, the thumbnail, whatever that is. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where it&amp;#8217;s like in the category archive, you&amp;#8217;ve instantly shown a nice basic modern design treatment with your colors and for everything.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Yep. Yeah. And it, I mean, and, and we&amp;#8217;d have a button that says, um, you know, swap for featured image. Like we&amp;#8217;ve taken your featured image, we&amp;#8217;ve put some text over it, you know, if you like this, make your featured image better. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So then it just one in, one out. We&amp;#8217;re not gonna delete your featured image cuz you could regenerate, want to regenerate the image again or something. But it would, yeah, like, so we&amp;#8217;ll give you that option. Like you probably don&amp;#8217;t want to do it by default. Um, but, so yeah, I, for now, let&amp;#8217;s, let&amp;#8217;s wrap up for today. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Yeah. Sorry, I, we went over. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; No, it&amp;#8217;s fine. [01:27:00] Um, you saw my note. I put a couple of things in Slack. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I was in Never Neverland. I like it when you&amp;#8217;re in Never Neverland.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. We should get that. Um,&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; cool. Um, but I think, yeah, I think at this point, like I&amp;#8217;m pretty close to something that does something and, and let&amp;#8217;s have that something, that Alpha version run against. I mean, let&amp;#8217;s, let&amp;#8217;s get, create a Post Status staging or something. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, but see what it, you know, Let&amp;#8217;s watch it run because there&amp;#8217;s other technical things. I wanna see, like we said, pricing. I wanna see how long it takes, you know, stuff like that. So let&amp;#8217;s, let&amp;#8217;s get into, let&amp;#8217;s, let&amp;#8217;s solve the problem for one and for 10 and for a hundred. And then, [01:28:00] you know, start to, and we&amp;#8217;ll continue to talk about the actual product and we&amp;#8217;ll just, and, you know, we&amp;#8217;re designing a really nice engine. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s, we&amp;#8217;ll also talk about what the car looks like and then we can drop the engine in the car.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; So there&amp;#8217;s 6,800 posts in, in Post says blog post only. Okay.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; That would be perfect. That&amp;#8217;s a great number. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; That would be â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;okay. Okay, I&amp;#8217;ll, I&amp;#8217;ll, I&amp;#8217;ll be thinking about what the card I wanted to look like, but I think it&amp;#8217;s title featured image, the standard branding.&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Um, and yeah, and like I said, I mean, we&amp;#8217;re, we&amp;#8217;re, I&amp;#8217;ve, I&amp;#8217;ve already, I have, I couldn&amp;#8217;t show you, but I have two, you know, two very basic templates started. They are so easy to create. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can, we can create 10, you know, in an hour. Just going, [01:29:00] oh, put this here, here, here. Cool. That&amp;#8217;s one. Put this here, here, here. Background image two, you know, cuz I&amp;#8217;ve, I&amp;#8217;ve, for better or worse, like, I went down the rabbit hole of abstracting a lot of this stuff out. So we can just say, I want a color, you know, I want background color, I want text color, I want, so it&amp;#8217;s just color, color, color, color. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Font, font, font, font, on and on. So, We can, we can even sit down, like once we have one basic thing that we know is running, working, then you and I could, you know, have one of these calls where we just knock together 10 different templates. Okay?&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Thanks man. I lost track of time. Thanks for going&amp;nbsp; â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; over. No, it&amp;#8217;s fine. â¨&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, but yeah, so stay on for a minute. Okay. Session 11. End.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>BuddyPress: BuddyPress has a new purpose</title>
	<guid>https://buddypress.org/?p=329306</guid>
	<link>https://buddypress.org/2023/04/buddypress-has-a-new-purpose/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello! This post is the first in a series of five posts in which weâll outline the new direction we plan to take regarding plugin maintenance and evolutions. After some introductory words, weâll focus on the new BuddyPress purpose that I believe we should adopt for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We havenât forgotten that, at the end of 2021, we had some conversations (&lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/support/topic/what-is-the-most-important-thing-buddypress-is-missing/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/buddypress-plugin-usage-declining-remaining-contributors-discuss-path-forward&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) about this Â« difficult to answer with a few words Â» question. These happened once the &lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/2022/09/lets-talk-about-us-buddypress/&quot;&gt;pluginâs active installs statistics went a bit under 200.000&lt;/a&gt;. Our WordPress plugin directory pageâs âactive installationsâ value suddenly changed from â200,000+â to â100,000+ââthough the actual number only changed from just over 200.000 to about 190.000 active installation&amp;#8211;making this decline seem pretty spectacular &lt;img src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4c9.png&quot; alt=&quot;ð&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;. It was nevertheless a great opportunity to think together about how the plugin should evolve now that &lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/2023/03/lets-celebrate-buddypress-15th-anniversary-welcome-the-first-attachments-add-on-features/&quot;&gt;15 years&lt;/a&gt; have passed since its birth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-329306&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dashicons dashicons-buddicons-buddypress-logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, let me offer some thanks on behalf of the BuddyPress development team:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks a lot to the women &amp;amp; men who are trusting the plugin to power their community WordPress sites &lt;img src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f60d.png&quot; alt=&quot;ð&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Thanks a million to the contributors who share some of their free time, energy or resources with us to maintain the plugin &lt;img src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f91d.png&quot; alt=&quot;ð¤&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Warm gratitude to &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://automattic.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Automattic&lt;/a&gt; for providing BuddyPressâs web site, our &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;devâupdates&lt;/a&gt; blog as well as our &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Trac environment&lt;/a&gt;, these tools are essential to BuddyPress &amp;amp; its community &lt;img src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1faf6.png&quot; alt=&quot;ð«¶&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Finally huge thanks to everyone of us, members of the team; for 15 years weâve been working together to maintain &amp;amp; improve this free and open-source plugin &lt;img src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4aa.png&quot; alt=&quot;ðª&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;Your feedback: the main points&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I believe we can organize your ideas in 5 categories:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should be our main purpose(s)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How should the plugin be organized?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What features should BuddyPress include?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What improvements does the plugin UI need?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How can we attract and keep new contributors?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As introduced earlier into this post, letâs wrap up your feedback about the first topic and explain how they contributed to what I think should be our new main purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;Key feedback about BuddyPressâs purpose&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Â« Communities organized around a product Â»&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Â« It is the perfect choice for &lt;strong&gt;company intranets&lt;/strong&gt; Â»&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Â« &lt;strong&gt;Private&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;secure&lt;/strong&gt; social network just for your friends/family Â»&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Â« Sites for educational courses, coaching Â»&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Â« It would have been the collaboration platform of choice over the pandemic had the &lt;strong&gt;privacy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;security&lt;/strong&gt; been there Â»&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Â« &lt;strong&gt;Needs a more specific mission&lt;/strong&gt; and purpose: BuddyVerse Â»&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Â« &lt;strong&gt;Too &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer-focused&lt;/strong&gt; Â»&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, hereâs our siteâs tagline about BuddyPressâs purpose: Â« &lt;em&gt;Fun &amp;amp; flexible software for online communities, teams, and groups. BuddyPress helps you build any kind of community website using WordPress, with member profiles, activity streams, user groups, messaging, and more&lt;/em&gt;. Â»&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Letâs start with the last point as it contains negative implications: Â« &lt;strong&gt;too developer-focused&lt;/strong&gt; Â» &lt;img src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2699.png&quot; alt=&quot;â&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, we have third party plugins or themes in mind at some point during our coding process: our main concern about these is potential compatibility issues. Thatâs why when we have a doubt, we put backward compatibility code into the plugin. Itâs also true we used to primarily think about BuddyPress as a plugin you can build great things on top of it; thatâs reflected in the Â« helps you build Â» part of our tagline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This model is interesting as long as third-party plugin authors are very involved with contributing to BuddyPress. However, they do not share their energy &amp;amp; time with us as often as was common in BuddyPressâs early years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I believe &lt;strong&gt;we now need to satisfy end-users first&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f468-200d-1f469-200d-1f467-200d-1f466.png&quot; alt=&quot;ð¨âð©âð§âð¦&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;. A reproach I often read in reviews posted about the plugin on &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/buddypress/reviews/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt; is: Â« BuddyPress is not including the basic features any end-user would expect so that it&amp;#8217;s needed to install other third party plugins Â». And a majority of reviewers are then regularly complaining: Â« a lot of these plugins have not been updated for a while or worse are no longer maintained Â». &lt;img src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a0.png&quot; alt=&quot;â &quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt; The problem then is that using these plugins can increase WordPress sites security threats even if BuddyPress benefits from the WP hacker1 program. Being able to &lt;strong&gt;run a safe community&lt;/strong&gt; is very important: we don&amp;#8217;t settle in a neighborhood when our security is at risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt; is a basic need we absolutely have to satisfy &lt;img src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f510.png&quot; alt=&quot;ð&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;. Yes, BuddyPress can be an interesting choice for company intranets, social stores, family circles or social learning platforms as soon as we can &lt;strong&gt;easily lock some areas of the community pages&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About federating WordPress site owners updates into a BuddyVerse &lt;img src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f30d.png&quot; alt=&quot;ð&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s an amazing idea I already heard of 5 years ago during the WordCamp Europe 2017. As WordPress is powering around 40% of Internet sites, I guess there&amp;#8217;s an interesting potential, but I believe&lt;strong&gt; we need a lot more contributors&lt;/strong&gt; to master the &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ActivityPub protocol&lt;/a&gt; (extending the &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ActivityPub WordPress plugin&lt;/a&gt;?) or the &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://matrix.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Matrix standard&lt;/a&gt; and required developments to allow 2 or more WordPress instances to follow each others or more globally to achieve a &lt;strong&gt;distributed BuddyPress network&lt;/strong&gt;. To avoid missing the Â« &lt;em&gt;we figured out being chained into social media owned by capricious billionaires was masochist&lt;/em&gt;ic Â» opportunity, maybe we can make a first step into this direction and reach something approaching improving how we deal with RSS feeds &amp;amp; implementing &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Webmentions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To conclude this part of your feedbacks review, I think we need to work in directions so that you can use BuddyPress to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-text-align-center&quot;&gt;Â« Get together safely, &lt;strong&gt;in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;your own way&lt;/strong&gt;, in WordPress Â».&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think the Â« &lt;strong&gt;own&lt;/strong&gt; Â» word is fundamental: compared to social media &lt;img src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4b8.png&quot; alt=&quot;ð¸&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt; where you lose ownership over your data, where this information is used to earn money off your content. &lt;strong&gt;With BuddyPress, you control every aspect of your community&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;The first two concrete steps&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BuddyPress 12.0, our next major version, will introduce a huge, necessary improvement to make many other improvements possible. We are replacing our Legacy URL parser with a new BP Rewrites API (which is based on the WordPress Rewrite API). We are completely restructuring the way BuddyPress analyzes URLs to decide whether to load community content and what is being requested. The benefits for you:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every BuddyPress URL will be customizable into your language (I heard it was important for SEO).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;BuddyPress will finally support plain permalinks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;BP URL parsing will be more reliable &amp;amp; fully compliant with WordPress best practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because this change is potentially a breaking one for plugins that wonât be updated, weâll also build a BP Classic plugin, so youâll be able to continue enjoying these slow-to-update plugins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Secondly, &lt;strong&gt;12.0 will also include a new community visibility feature giving you the ability to use BuddyPress to power your private communities&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Weâll take more time than usual to reach this 12th milestone. We need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.buddypress.org/plugins/&quot;&gt;document the needed changes plugin authors&lt;/a&gt; will need to perform as well as inform our users what they should do if something goes wrong with the 12.0 upgrade process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.0 final release is slated for October 30, and we welcome everyone wishing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.buddypress.org/participate-and-contribute/&quot;&gt;get involved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should we organize the plugin?&lt;/strong&gt; Thatâs the second category of your feedback, and weâll talk about it in the next post of this series.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-spacer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Props&lt;/strong&gt;: many thanks to &lt;a class=&quot;bp-suggestions-mention&quot; href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/members/dcavins/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@dcavins&lt;/a&gt; for his review &lt;img src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f970.png&quot; alt=&quot;ð¥°&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Kirki Plugin Up for Sale, Development Discontinued</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=144071</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/kirki-plugin-up-for-sale-development-discontinued</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;David Vongries, developer of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/kirki/&quot;&gt;Kirki Customizer Framework&lt;/a&gt; plugin, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kirki.org/blog/goodbye/&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; he is sunsetting the product and will discontinue development and support. Vongries bought the plugin in 2020 from its original creator, Ari Stathopoulos, and grew its user base from 400K to 600K active installs. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://kirki.org/blog/kirki-pro-is-now-live/&quot;&gt;launched Kirki PRO&lt;/a&gt; with additional extensions in March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When I first acquired Kirki in early 2020, I had big plans for it,&amp;#8221; Vongries said. &amp;#8220;Although we were able to execute on step one of the 2-step plan we had for the plugin, as time went on, I lost passion for the project mainly due to the direction WordPress core has taken with Gutenberg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Itâs clear to me now that I was too ambitious in taking on the project.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kirki&amp;#8217;s customizer framework enabled theme authors to add custom controls and advanced features to the customizer, including the ability to style it, and add a custom header. Although block theme adoption has been a slow process, the death knell for the Customizer rang years ago. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Vongries said that exploring how Kirki could potentially extend Gutenberg was one of his goals. Stathopoulos had also discussed the possibility of moving away from the customizer to work with full-site editing and global styles, helping themes that use Kirki transition to global styles. These goals did not materialize but the potential for them is still there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vongries is now looking for someone to acquire the plugin but is committed to providing limited support to users in the meantime, including fixing critical bugs and compatibility issues that happen as the result of WordPress core updates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The current active install count in the WordPress repository is 600,000, which presents a great opportunity to revamp the plugin and get it in front of actual users,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;I believe that thereâs still great potential in Kirki, and Iâm looking for someone who shares that vision to take it forward.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vongries has put a price tag of $30K on the plugin, which includes all the assets &amp;#8211; the website, GitHub, and PRO extensions. No further active development or updates are planned unless Kirki gets acquired by someone who wants to carry it forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WP Feature Notifications Project Progresses Towards MVP for Standardizing Admin Notifications</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=144049</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/wp-feature-notifications-project-progresses-towards-mvp-for-standardizing-admin-notifications</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The WP Feature Notifications project, formerly know as &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/08/05/feature-project-proposal-wp-notify/&quot;&gt;WP Notify&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/04/25/wp-feature-notifications-2023-status-update/&quot;&gt;making progress&lt;/a&gt; towards creating a better way to manage and deliver notifications in the WordPress admin. Core contributor Jonathan Bossenger started the project in 2019 with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/08/05/feature-project-proposal-wp-notify/&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; to build a unified notification center in WordPress that would replace the chaos caused by developers hooking into admin notices, which was not designed to be a notification system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the latest 0.2.0 update of the feature plugin, contributors have implemented a more robust JavaScript-based system for standardizing how notifications appear in the admin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What originally started as a&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/21/request-for-feedback-feature-notifications-proof-of-concept/&quot;&gt;Â UX proof of concept&lt;/a&gt;Â has evolved into a more sophisticatedÂ JS-based system for displaying notifications based on serialized data,&amp;#8221; WordPress core contributor Joe Bailey-Roberts said. &amp;#8220;At the moment this uses static dummy data, however in a future update this will interface with the upcoming REST controllers to display persistent data.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project is restructuring its leadership with Bossenger stepping down as the lead and Bailey-Roberts taking over the position. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although WP Feature Notifications currently exists as a feature plugin, its contributors are intent on seeing it merged into core when ready, instead of kept as a canonical plugin. They are eager to see the project&amp;#8217;s design and functionality work in concert with the planned modernization of the admin as part of Gutenberg Phase 3.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Notification functionality is indeed fundamental, and already in constant use via the admin_notices hook, a workaround that has major issues of standardization andÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/50486&quot;&gt;accessibility&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; Bailey-Roberts said. &amp;#8220;The newÂ APIÂ needs to be universal, and available by default, otherwise admin_notices will remain the de facto option.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contributors plan to remove the demo content from the plugin in version 0.3.0 and make it into an MVP (minimum viable product) with a functional notification system. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The next (and largest) piece of the puzzle is persistent database storage of notification data,&amp;#8221; Bailey-Roberts said. &amp;#8220;Weâre working on finalizing the proposed schema, as well as discussing other issues such as retention, translations,Â multisiteÂ support, and more.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In order to keep moving the project forward, contributors are seeking a partnership with a core committer for guidance on preparing the plugin to be a good candidate fore core, as well as additional contributors with PHP and SQL expertise. The feature plugin is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/wp-feature-notifications&quot;&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; for testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A solution for notifications in WordPress is critical for improving the admin experience for every user. A standardized way of displaying notifications will make site management a more predictable and less cognitively draining task. The WP Feature Notifications project is still in the early stages but it has some momentum and it needs help. Contributors can join the team&amp;#8217;s weekly office hours on WP Slack in the&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C2K1C71FE&quot;&gt;Â #feature-notifications channel&lt;/a&gt;, and the project will also have representation at WordCampÂ Europe&amp;#8217;sÂ Contributor Day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: #73 â Ryan Welcher on Using the create-block Tool to Quickly Scaffold a New Block Plugin</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&amp;p=144046</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/podcast/73-ryan-welcher-on-using-the-create-block-tool-to-quickly-scaffold-a-new-block-plugin</link>
	<description>Transcript&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:00] Nathan Wrigley: Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case how a block plugin creation can be speeded up with the create-block tool.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you have a topic that you&amp;#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast I&amp;#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So on the podcast today we have Ryan Welcher. Ryan is a developer advocate sponsored by Automattic. He has been developing with WordPress since 2009. And before becoming a developer advocate, worked for agencies large and small, and as a freelancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve been using WordPress for any length of time, you&amp;#8217;ll have come across the new paradigm for content creation, blocks. Every part of your website can now be created and amended as a block. Pages, posts, text, images, headers, footers, navigation, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This has widened what&amp;#8217;s possible for those who don&amp;#8217;t want to mess around with the code of their website. You can add in blocks for almost anything. And change how it looks and behaves from within the block editor interface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent move forward, but there&amp;#8217;s still an impediment for non-technical people because creating a block of your own is difficult. If you are able to use the selection of blocks that ship with WordPress Core, or you can find a third party block which does what you need, great. But if you need something specific, you&amp;#8217;re going to have to create your own block solution. And that can be hard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ryan is on the podcast today to tell us about the create-block tool. And how it can make your pathway towards block creation a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We start off talking about Ryan&amp;#8217;s background and how he became interested in WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We then move on to how he thinks that the adoption of blocks is becoming more widespread given the maturing of tools and learning materials available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The conversation then turns to how the create-block tool can help you scaffold your blocks. It&amp;#8217;s not a tool which is going to build the blocks for you, but it will help you set up the environment and build process, which you need to get started. Really it&amp;#8217;s all about saving you time and effort on things which don&amp;#8217;t really you get you building your blocks, but which you need to do that work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We discuss what you can expect from the create-block tool, and the prior knowledge that you&amp;#8217;ll need to have once the tool has you up and running. What level of expertise do you need, and is the tool under continual development?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We spend a few moments talking about the live streaming which Ryan does each week in which he lived code solutions to view as block-based problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve thought about creating your own blocks but have been put off by the technical barrier, this podcast is for you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&amp;#8217;ll find all the other episodes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so without further delay, I bring you Ryan Welcher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am joined on the podcast today by Ryan Welcher. Hello.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:04:29] Ryan Welcher: Hello. Thank you for having me. Super excited to be here today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:04:32] Nathan Wrigley: I&amp;#8217;m really, really happy to have you on the podcast today, because I really need to learn what it is that you are going to be talking about. We&amp;#8217;re going to be talking a great deal about the Create Block Tool, how it works, what it does, how to make it come onto a local computer near you. But before we do that, I wonder Ryan, if you wouldn&amp;#8217;t mind spending just a few moments telling us a little bit about yourself, your backstory, your relationship with WordPress, who you work for, all of that&amp;#8217;s good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:05:00] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, so I am a developer advocate. I&amp;#8217;m sponsored by Automattic. So I&amp;#8217;m part of the five for the future, giving back to the open source project that is WordPress. I&amp;#8217;ve been a developer since about 2004. I started doing flash development. I don&amp;#8217;t know if anyone remembers flash development, but I started doing that. In 2009 I was introduced to WordPress and I haven&amp;#8217;t looked back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since then I&amp;#8217;ve worked at, I was a freelancer. I worked at small agencies, large agencies, shout out to 10up, which an amazing place to work, I love that place. Yeah, and so I&amp;#8217;ve just found my way into Dev Rel, which is a very, very fun and exciting and challenging, and way different than what I was doing two years ago. But it&amp;#8217;s been great.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:05:41] Nathan Wrigley: Can I go a little bit off piste, against the flow of what the conversation will be about? Could you just tell us a little bit about the way that that job works? So you are sponsored by Automattic, is that a full-time thing?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:05:52] Ryan Welcher: It is. I work on a team of Dev Rel, of developer advocates, and our job is to appear on podcasts, speak at conferences, create awareness and work on documentation and do all this sort of stuff. But, sorry, yeah, I cut you off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:06:04] Nathan Wrigley: No, no, it was really just, I&amp;#8217;m curious as to how that role is advertised. Was it something that you saw in like a WordPress space, and you applied for it? And also who is it that decides what your roster of work is? Do you have autonomy there or is there a panel of people that you have to report to and so on?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:06:24] Ryan Welcher: Those are great questions. So it was a role that was advertised. I saw someone mention it, and I think the WordPress Slack, the Make Slack. I applied and went through the process there. As far as the work that we do, it&amp;#8217;s kind of a mixed bag. We do have a fair amount of autonomy. This is a newer team. There&amp;#8217;s six of us for the entire internet, so. Sorry, for 43% of the internet. So there&amp;#8217;s a lot of work to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have a focus on improving documentation. That&amp;#8217;s kind of our number one focus at the moment. But, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of smaller projects as well. I try to maintain the Gutenberg Examples repository, which is a GitHub repository that shows examples of working with blocks and some of the various things that you can do with Gutenberg, like a custom admin page that interacts with the data stores in Gutenberg and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, I was just at WordCamp Asia, which was an amazing experience. I wasn&amp;#8217;t speaking, but I was meeting with lots of developers and just kind of like schmoozing. I get to schmooze professionally now, which is a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:07:16] Nathan Wrigley: That&amp;#8217;s amazing. I do wonder since Gutenberg dropped several years ago now. I mean, it really is, it has been going for many, many years. But there really was a fork in the road for WordPress there, and there was a little bit of tension. Some people didn&amp;#8217;t see the purpose of Gutenberg and ultimately blocks. And I do wonder if roles like yours became more important after that. Do you feel like a need to message and get the word out and educate more after Gutenberg dropped?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:07:49] Ryan Welcher: I think yes. I also think that the tech industry, I mean, there&amp;#8217;s always been developer advocates. I remember I went to a flash conference years and years and years ago, and I saw someone speak there who was, what were they called at the time? A platform evangelist for Adobe and was basically doing Dev Rel stuff, like showing what you can do with flash and the new features and cool stuff. So it&amp;#8217;s been around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think now people are really starting to see the benefits of it. Especially when you have a large community like WordPress. There&amp;#8217;s so many people. And having people who can help, you know, the education piece. And there&amp;#8217;s a lot of yelling into the void without people like me and our team to hear what you&amp;#8217;re saying. Like, you know, the documentation needs work. Okay, well someone needs to work on that. Now that&amp;#8217;s my job to work on that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I definitely think that there&amp;#8217;s, there&amp;#8217;s benefits to Dev Rel in any industry for sure. But I think, to an extent, when 5.0 came out, I think that sort of showed the need for someone to come in and say, hey, you know, do you need help there? Or like, have you heard about this tool? Or what&amp;#8217;s path of least resistance to move from a short code to a block? All those sort of things. So I think yes and no. I think it&amp;#8217;s just overall, having a dev team for the open source project that is WordPress is a great idea to gather feedback and help and just help. Full stop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:09:06] Nathan Wrigley: I think whether it&amp;#8217;s as a result of endeavors from people like you, or just the passage of time. I get the feeling that in the year 2023, the message is really getting through. It seems like the inertia against using blocks seems to be dissipating. I really don&amp;#8217;t seem to be exposed to too many YouTube videos or people on Twitter moaning too much about that anymore. Moaning is probably the wrong word. I should probably reclassify that, questioning it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:09:38] Ryan Welcher: No, I think it&amp;#8217;s a very accurate word.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:09:40] Nathan Wrigley: So it feels as though we are at an inflection point. That there&amp;#8217;s enough time that&amp;#8217;s passed. There&amp;#8217;s enough projects out there. There&amp;#8217;s enough people that have released resources and commercial products around the block space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It kind of feels like it&amp;#8217;s moment has really arrived.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:09:57] Ryan Welcher: I agree, yeah&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:09:59] Nathan Wrigley: Maybe moving from a position now of teaching people that it exists and it&amp;#8217;s an option, into teaching people how to use it and get the most out of it?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:10:07] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, I would agree with that. I think since 5.0 the block API has matured, and has stabilized. There was a couple of releases where every release, the function that you called to actually register a block in php, its name changed, and its function parameters changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then there was like one version, and then the next version was a slight variation but the next version was the same name as the first version, but with different parameters. So there&amp;#8217;s some confusion there. And you know, with the introduction of block.json, it&amp;#8217;s the json file that describes what your block does and what its functionality is. Having those pieces sort of stable and consistent have really helped the adoption of blocks and custom blocks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think also, and this is a perfect segue into what we&amp;#8217;re talking about today, the tools like to Create Block Package that we&amp;#8217;re going to talk about introduced to best practice and showed people, how do I structure my blocks?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So when I was at 10up, I was at 10up when Gutenberg came out. And we spent a lot of time, the company spent a lot of time trying to figure out, trying to navigate how is this going to work for an agency? How do we build these things? What files go where and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so that&amp;#8217;s a huge amount of cognitive dissonance. When you&amp;#8217;re trying to figure out a new api. When you&amp;#8217;re trying to figure out a brand new paradigm. And then you&amp;#8217;ve got to figure out, well, where do my files go? A tool like the Create Block Package just shows you where the recommended structure is. And then that takes away a lot of the guesswork, and then everything becomes consistent at that point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then if I&amp;#8217;m working on a project that someone else has worked on, the files at least are in the same place. And, I think the maturity of blocks and the block API has really left a lot of the people who just didn&amp;#8217;t like it kind of behind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:11:39] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so given that we don&amp;#8217;t really have any accurate statistics on who&amp;#8217;s using blocks. What proportion of the 43% of the web that&amp;#8217;s using WordPress have moved over to blocks, or perhaps are sticking with the page builder that they&amp;#8217;ve been using for the last several years and so on. Given that we don&amp;#8217;t really know that, what is the elevator pitch for blocks really? What are the small things that you can mention on a podcast in a short space of time, which really nail your colors to the master and say, okay, this is the promise of blocks? This is what blocks can deliver. This is why it&amp;#8217;s new, and why it&amp;#8217;s worth looking at.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:12:14] Ryan Welcher: That&amp;#8217;s a great question. I think that blocks offer, well, first of all, there&amp;#8217;s no theme or plugin lock-in. So that&amp;#8217;s a big concern with, take the example of a freelancer that is hired to build a site and the client is non-technical, but they want to be able to manage their own content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, you reach for some of these page builder tools, and now once you&amp;#8217;ve reached for them, you&amp;#8217;re locked into them. That&amp;#8217;s not a criticism, but that is inherently one issue. So with blocks you don&amp;#8217;t have that. Your blocks are part of core and you could still suffer a bit of lock-in, if you went with a very bespoke sort of block set or like a block suite or something, but there&amp;#8217;s definitely some benefits there. You don&amp;#8217;t have a lot of the overhead or any of the overhead that come with some of the larger, page builder plugins, just because they have so many features.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so there&amp;#8217;s some load considerations there. I think it changes the way that you can look at your content. This is a bit more of a philosophical question, but, so historically when we built a site, we had a title for post content. We had the content, which was like the classic editor. And then we had post meta, and you know tags and categories. But if we wanted to store an extra piece of information with a piece of content, there was really only post meta available to us, because the template that was being shown for the front end that would represent that piece of content ,was controlling the layout.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so we had to store, let&amp;#8217;s use an example of an author byline. Say we wanted to have guest authors on a site. So we wanted to store that author name. Well, on the template side you would use get post meta, the function, to get that piece of information and, and display it in your template.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, now we can do that all with blocks, because our template is the editor, and the way it looks is basically represented almost one-to-one in the block editor experience and the site editor. So you have this question of, do I need all this post meta now? Now I can just store it as a block attribute, and move it around and do what I need to do with it. So I think there&amp;#8217;s lots of good reasons to use blocks. That&amp;#8217;s a few of them maybe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:14:09] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s great. Thank you. I guess the primary issue is that using something like a page builder, whether or not it&amp;#8217;s got bloat or whether or not you&amp;#8217;ve got the lock in and all of that, is that it&amp;#8217;s relatively straightforward. You just click some buttons essentially. Drag things onto the canvas and you&amp;#8217;re done. In Gutenberg we&amp;#8217;ve got some core blocks, and increasingly you can really start to lay things out with group blocks and cover blocks and things like that. You know, you really can start to finesse the overall design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if you want to do anything bespoke, in other words, if you want to create a block which does something that you wish to do, something new, something interesting. Then you&amp;#8217;ve got to create that block. And the barrier to doing that I feel is quite high. I wonder if you&amp;#8217;ve got any thoughts on that? Whether or not the creation of blocks is still in the domain of, how to describe it? You&amp;#8217;ve got to have a certain fairly high level of understanding of all sorts of technologies to make these blocks come into existence. Or do you?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:15:12] Ryan Welcher: Well, you do and you don&amp;#8217;t. It&amp;#8217;s kind of like, it&amp;#8217;s the classic developer question, you know. It depends, is always the answer. Whenever you ask a developer something, it&amp;#8217;s always, well, it depends. But, I think yes. You do need to have a certain amount of information. But take blocks out of the equation. If you wanted to make a bespoke WordPress theme, with custom templates, you still need to have a certain level of development experience and a certain level of prowess in php, html, css and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, that&amp;#8217;s not to say that the barrier to entry hasn&amp;#8217;t been raised. Because when I learned WordPress in 2009, I could just copy and paste everything I did into a theme and it worked. Now we&amp;#8217;re with blocks. We&amp;#8217;re looking at, build processes and learning some JavaScript frameworks in React, some knowledge there. So there is, there&amp;#8217;s definitely some things to learn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, there are some tools that can help. Again, this Create Block Package that will kind of get you started and get you a basic scaffold of a block, that you can just then change and add your flourishes to.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think in general, web development is more complicated than it ever has been. I mean, that&amp;#8217;s maybe because I&amp;#8217;ve been doing it for a long time and I&amp;#8217;m an old man who fears change a little bit, maybe. I don&amp;#8217;t know. But I think that knowing JavaScript and Matt said, you know, learn JavaScript deeply, and it&amp;#8217;s true. I think I felt that pain when I was, starting to work in Gutenberg. I&amp;#8217;m a php first developer. That&amp;#8217;s what I learned. I did a little bit of JavaScript, but not a lot. Learning these new concepts was hard. But, I think it&amp;#8217;s well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I think you can do things where you don&amp;#8217;t need to know, you don&amp;#8217;t need to be an expert in React. You don&amp;#8217;t need to be an expert in Webpack and build process. You don&amp;#8217;t need to be that level. If you choose to be that level, you can, but you can do some pretty complicated blocks, with sort of a base understanding of some of the pieces that you need to put together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I think part of my job is to help people navigate that stuff. I&amp;#8217;m a big proponent of the Create Block Package. I&amp;#8217;ve worked on the package. I&amp;#8217;ve helped to add features that developers have asked for to make life easier. One big feature was the ability to have multiple blocks be part of the plugin that is generated when you run the package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I think there is a barrier to entry, but I think it&amp;#8217;s mitigated by, like, you don&amp;#8217;t need to be an expert in all the things. You don&amp;#8217;t even need to really understand the build process, for example. It&amp;#8217;s provided, and it&amp;#8217;s just run a command and just know that this command does this and this command does that. And really, if you don&amp;#8217;t want to look under the hood, you don&amp;#8217;t have to. It&amp;#8217;s going to work for you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:17:30] Nathan Wrigley: We&amp;#8217;ll get onto the Create Block Tool in a moment, if that&amp;#8217;s all right. But just one last question around this whole education piece and learning about blocks. It feels that there&amp;#8217;s a real concerted effort now to create learning materials. There&amp;#8217;s obviously learn.wordpress.org, and a whole bunch of other things.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of videos being created in amongst the community. People like Jonathan Bossenger and Anne McCarthy and so on. And I&amp;#8217;m just wondering if you, well, firstly, if you feel that that&amp;#8217;s the case, if the education piece is a lot better now than it was when you were trying to learn at 10up? In other words it&amp;#8217;s less of an uphill struggle because you&amp;#8217;ve got somewhere to turn to.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:18:09] Ryan Welcher: So much less, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:18:11] Nathan Wrigley: So let&amp;#8217;s do that one first. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:18:13] Ryan Welcher: Absolutely. I think, yeah, you&amp;#8217;re right. I mean, I think that when Gutenberg came out, there was no real pragmatic, like practical, how to use this information. Because it was a new thing and there was a lot being changed and people didn&amp;#8217;t have the resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#8217;t have the knowledge to build the resources. Now we&amp;#8217;re four years in now, and that&amp;#8217;s obviously built up. The folks that learn.wordpress.org doing a fantastic job. Jonathan&amp;#8217;s stuff is great. I&amp;#8217;m going to shamelessly self-promote here. I stream every Thursday at ten thirty Eastern on Twitch, where we do block development live. and I put that on my YouTube channel. And I&amp;#8217;m not the only one. I&amp;#8217;m sure there&amp;#8217;s, there are people that are putting out content that is up to date and accessible and easier to figure out the things that you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, there&amp;#8217;s always going to be gaps in that knowledge because the APIs are still evolving, and every time there&amp;#8217;s a new release to the plugin, the Gutenberg plugin, there&amp;#8217;s new features and things like that. But yeah, I think now compared to when 5.0 came out, I think there&amp;#8217;s a lot more really good information out there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m finding that there&amp;#8217;s older information that hasn&amp;#8217;t been updated. That&amp;#8217;s one of the pitfalls of the writing a tutorial on your blog post or creating a video or doing whatever, is that it&amp;#8217;s sort of a snapshot in time of the APIs. And so it&amp;#8217;s there, but then there&amp;#8217;s, well, hey, did you know that there&amp;#8217;s this new way of doing whatever it is that you&amp;#8217;re doing that&amp;#8217;s a little bit easier, you know, faster, better, smarter, or whatever, right?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:19:34] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. Going back to your shameless plug. Could you tell us a little bit more about that? So you say you go live, every Thursday, and we will get from you the URL and will post it into the show notes. Do you have an agenda for that? Do you know what you&amp;#8217;re going to do in advance? Or is it driven by who shows up and what questions they want to be answered?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:19:53] Ryan Welcher: it&amp;#8217;s a bit of both. I&amp;#8217;ve been doing it now for about a year and a half. I&amp;#8217;m on Twitch, which is an interesting experience. So I live code. I usually show up with some kind of agenda. Like, for example, right now, last few weeks, every other week I do a stream on the new features that have been released in the Gutenberg plugin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re not aware, the Gutenberg plugin is on a two week release cycle. So every two weeks we get a new version of that plugin, and then all those versions get rolled up and released into the next version of WordPress Core. I go through the release posts on make.wordpress.org, and we call out some of the more developery refocused things like, a new component is added or a new whatever. So we do that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The off weeks, I usually build something. Like right now I&amp;#8217;m building a block that integrates with OpenAI to generate images. But the images that are being generated are terrifying because I keep doing like people laughing. I don&amp;#8217;t know if you&amp;#8217;ve ever seen OpenAI generate people&amp;#8217;s faces. It&amp;#8217;s the scariest thing I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen in my life. Have a lot of fun doing that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m actually going to be doing one and I haven&amp;#8217;t done this yet, and again, sorry for the shameless self-promotion here, but in a couple of weeks I&amp;#8217;m going to be doing a bring me your block development issues stream, where I&amp;#8217;m hoping that people will submit these problems that they&amp;#8217;re running into and I&amp;#8217;m going to try to see if I can kind of like fix &amp;#8217;em live. And we&amp;#8217;re going to stream that and see how it goes. It&amp;#8217;s going to be wildly successful or it&amp;#8217;s going to be crickets the whole time. I don&amp;#8217;t know. That&amp;#8217;s usually the only two extremes you get on live.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:21:19] Nathan Wrigley: I do like the idea of a, like an open surgery in a way. Where people can show up and give you their problems and presumably the further in advance they can give you the problems, the more of a chance you&amp;#8217;ve got of actually solving them. But that&amp;#8217;s a really interesting idea and an excellent way to help educate people live, watching somebody else do it, not just on a forum or an email chain. Actually seeing it happen and get an explanation for why you&amp;#8217;re doing things and possibly even watching you make mistakes along the way and having to fix your own things, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:21:48] Ryan Welcher: If anyone comes to my stream, you will watch me make mistakes Yeah, I can&amp;#8217;t type when people are watching. There we go, that kind of sums my stream up. But yeah, it&amp;#8217;s a lot of good fun. And we have pretty good community of people who hang out in the chat and discuss things and answer questions and help me. There&amp;#8217;s one guy, I always make fun of him because he shows up and saves the day every time if I&amp;#8217;m running into an issue, he&amp;#8217;s like, here&amp;#8217;s your code. And he just pastes it, and I&amp;#8217;m like, oh okay, great. So now we can move on because Kevin saved my stream. So shout out to Kevin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:22:14] Nathan Wrigley: That&amp;#8217;s a, lovely community feel to it though, isn&amp;#8217;t it? There&amp;#8217;s something really nice about that. But definitely, before we hang up on this call, I will get the location for that and we&amp;#8217;ll post that into the show notes. So if anybody wants to go and hang out with Ryan on a Thursday and watch him live code and possibly take your own troubles and problems and share it with Ryan, yeah, that would be a really amazing enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okay, let&amp;#8217;s get onto the, what we probably should have started talking about a while ago, but never mind the Create Block Tool or the Create Block Package. So one of the problems that you highlighted right at the beginning when I said, what makes blocks difficult, is you talked about the tooling and the requirements that you need just to get started. So describe the problem that the tool is solving.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:22:58] Ryan Welcher: Sure. So if you want to build a block, there&amp;#8217;s a number of ways that you can do it. But if you wanted to build a block using React and JSX, which is the HTML extension, the JavaScript that React uses, you need a build process. You need the ability to take your JavaScript code and transpile, it&amp;#8217;s a fancy word of saying turn it into something else, into JavaScript that the browser can read.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So to do that you need a build process. And so a build process can be very complicated. Now, build processes have been around forever. If you&amp;#8217;ve heard of Grunt, or you&amp;#8217;ve heard of Bower. There&amp;#8217;s a few, so what we use is Webpack. Now Webpack can be extremely daunting to set up and deal with. The story that I always tell was the first React app I ever built was when I was working for an agency, and they wanted to use Webpack and we went to the Webpack documentation page and all it said was work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, it was very funny because the only comment on it was a giant picture of that meme of Picard with his arm stretched out going, why? I wish I had a screenshot of that because that&amp;#8217;s best story ever. Anyway, so that&amp;#8217;s your first issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your second issue is how do you even structure blocks? There&amp;#8217;s a number of files and a number of pieces to a block. And, you know, if you put 10 developers in a room, those 10 developers will have 10 different ways of scaffolding this. So that was always a bit of a problem as well. So what this tool does is it solves those problems first.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So it installs your build process, the one that is actually used by the Gutenberg project as well. It&amp;#8217;s maintained, it&amp;#8217;s got a million little features and you don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about that anymore. And then it also will scaffold the files for your block and put them, give you the names, give you all the files, give you a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you run the scaffolding tool, it will prefill a lot of the, sort of, details of your block and give you the starting point. And it bundles it all up inside of a plugin, and so it&amp;#8217;s a WordPress plugin that you can just enable and it installs all the dependencies and it even runs the build process. So you literally run it and then you press activate inside your plugin screen, and then you have an active block.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That takes away so much guesswork and so much busy work of having to like, figure out the naming of things and add files. It doesn&amp;#8217;t sound like a lot, but if you&amp;#8217;re building 20 blocks, and you have to like, copy and paste all your files and go in and rename everything, that can take a lot of work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:25:10] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I can well imagine how much time that&amp;#8217;s saving. Are there any constraints about where you can install this? So, currently I&amp;#8217;m on a Mac. I presume that we&amp;#8217;re all good to go there. What about Windows, Linux?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:25:22] Ryan Welcher: The only thing that you have to have is Node. So you have to have Node installed, because you can run it using a command called npx. And what it does is it, it won&amp;#8217;t download it and add it to your project, but it will just kind of reach out and run it once and then do its thing. So you need to have Node installed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This does work, to the best of my knowledge, it works pretty well across all the platforms. I believe there is an issue in Windows with a very specific configuration that doesn&amp;#8217;t copy a file to the right place. But that&amp;#8217;s less about the scaffolding tool and more about the build process. But there&amp;#8217;s a lot of people that work on this stuff. So I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;s going to be remedied pretty soon, yeah. The only dependency is Node, which is cross platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:26:02] Nathan Wrigley: Right, okay, perfect. So if I&amp;#8217;ve never done this before and I want to get my first block done. Realistically, how long is it between me thinking, hmm, create block tool, I&amp;#8217;m going to start using that, to having my first block on the page? Are we talking 10 minutes, an hour, less?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:26:20] Ryan Welcher: Two minutes. Assuming you have Node installed. Let&amp;#8217;s assume that. You can go to the documentation page and you can run npx at WordPress slash create block and give it a name, and it will prompt you for a bunch of questions. Like, what do you want to call this thing? What name space should it be in? You know, what&amp;#8217;s the description?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;ll ask you a bunch of questions and it&amp;#8217;ll just scaffold out the block for you. And the most amount of time is waiting for the dependencies. So that the block needs to be installed and then run. And that, honestly, I did a YouTube video on my channel where I timed it. And I think it took four minutes from start to finish and it was done.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And you have a fully functional plugin with a single block in it. And you enable it, and like I said, the block is available for use immediately. No, the block doesn&amp;#8217;t do anything. It&amp;#8217;s a very, very simple block. But that&amp;#8217;s how quickly you can get up and running with it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:27:09] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I think it&amp;#8217;s probably very important at this point to describe the limitations, because when I heard about Create Block Tool, I thought to myself, oh great, a tool which is going to help me to create blocks. Not literally create a block, but, you know, add in options and different, custom data and all of that. And that was what I was thinking I was going to get. So just draw a line, make it really clear what you get when this process is complete.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:27:34] Ryan Welcher: You get what&amp;#8217;s referred to as a static block. So there&amp;#8217;s two types of blocks, static and dynamic. And I can get into that if you want, and with no controls. So basically the block will, it shows you a message when you insert, it says hello from the post editor. And then it&amp;#8217;ll render that same message on the front end, and there&amp;#8217;s some CSS that&amp;#8217;s supplied to the front end and the back end.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s a very, very, very basic block. The tool doesn&amp;#8217;t have the ability to say, I want to be able to insert post meta. We can&amp;#8217;t do any of that level of customization, because there&amp;#8217;s just too many options. Like there&amp;#8217;s too many ways that you can build a block, and too many things a block can do. So there&amp;#8217;s just no, there&amp;#8217;s no way for us to build a tool that says, I want to build a block that accesses the REST API to retrieve this custom post type and display all of the information and do all the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s not something that the tool can do. But, what you get is a fully functioning, working block that is scaffolded to best practices, follows best practices. That shows you how to deal with the CSS, and how to enqueue all your different files, and everything is just built and ready to go for you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then at that point you have a starting point. So, as a developer, I used to hate having to do the busy work. What this does is this basically gets me a starting point, and now I can add the things that the client is paying me to do, right? I can add the controls. I can add the interface items, whatever you&amp;#8217;re building in your block. Iit gives you the starting point to actually build the thing that you want to build, not the, you don&amp;#8217;t have to do any ramp up to get there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:29:01] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, so within two or three minutes you&amp;#8217;ll have a block. All of the files in the right place. Everything&amp;#8217;s set up. Good to go. And then, really, dear developer, it&amp;#8217;s over to you. You got to figure out where to go from there. Do you have any, is there any sort of commenting in the files that&amp;#8217;s been added additionally to give you some sort of pointers as to, okay, this is what this is doing, this file is used for this and so on?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:29:24] Ryan Welcher: There is. It&amp;#8217;s commented fairly decently. There&amp;#8217;s kind of a fine line because if you want to use these for production, you know you&amp;#8217;re going to be removing a lot of those comments. There&amp;#8217;s a couple of files that every time I use it, I hate how well commented it is because I like to structure my files in a specific way. So there&amp;#8217;s a lot in there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then, at this point too, the sort of, the structure, the file structure&amp;#8217;s very well documented and it&amp;#8217;s just been adopted. People can change things and people can, it&amp;#8217;s very flexible. You can do it whatever you want, but the best practice has been well defined at this point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like that muscle memory thing. People just know that, oh yeah, okay. So I want to go to the edit.js file, because that&amp;#8217;s what I, that&amp;#8217;s what I changed to get it to make changes in the block editor experience and so on and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:30:05] Nathan Wrigley: Do you know if, well, WordPress&amp;#8217;s mission, I suppose, is to democratize publishing. And it would be, I suppose, an endeavor worth undertaking to have a tool which did carry you on from where the Create Block Tool got you to. In other words, a tool which helped you along the process of creating the block.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Do you know if there are any endeavors, any quiet whisperings in the dark corners of Automattic about this kind of tool? Is there any plan to do anything like that so that blocks can be created by, well, non-technical people?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:30:38] Ryan Welcher: There are tools out there in the community. Like I would hesitate to say that Automattic has any sort of secret plans, because that&amp;#8217;s not really how it works. It&amp;#8217;s more, it&amp;#8217;s driven by the community. I mean, I know Automattic does employ a lot of developers who do contribute to the project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But a lot of these tools come from the community and, for people like me to talk to folks and be like, hey, that&amp;#8217;d be a really cool feature to add, to Create Block. There&amp;#8217;s been a number of features where we&amp;#8217;ve been like, you know what? It&amp;#8217;s a really great idea, it&amp;#8217;s too specific. So it might be better served as a tool.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But I will say this, the create block package does have the ability to, you can provide what are called templates. So you can create your own custom template. So you can build a block that does X because you&amp;#8217;ve built a template. So I could build a template that is like, all right, I want to block that interfaces with custom post meta. And so I could build that template and when I run the package, I can point the package at that specific template and it will scaffold the files out, and I will have all of those starting points in there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not an interactive tool. I don&amp;#8217;t think where you&amp;#8217;ll see, what do you want this block to do? Like, unless somebody comes up with this really cool OpenAI integration, which might be a lot actually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:31:43] Nathan Wrigley: Somebody will probably do it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:31:45] Ryan Welcher: I&amp;#8217;m sure they will. Blocks can do so many things and they&amp;#8217;re so versatile and they&amp;#8217;re so, it&amp;#8217;s sort of like, how do you even start to define the questions that you ask in the automation process to say, what do you want to do? Like, do you need to access data stores? Sure. Is it a custom data store or is it one of the ones that Gutenberg provides? You know, so there&amp;#8217;s a lot, there&amp;#8217;s a lot that goes in there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:32:06] Nathan Wrigley: Does the tool itself get regular updates? I&amp;#8217;m imagining that the technology behind that is fairly fast moving, and there&amp;#8217;s a lot of new updates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:32:15] Ryan Welcher: It is being updated regularly. The package itself gets updated every two weeks when the Gutenberg project, so when the Guttenberg plugin is in release candidate. But there are features being added all the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, we added the feature not too long ago to be able to copy php files around. And, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of sort of under the hood things that, I&amp;#8217;m drawing a complete blank of all the features that I&amp;#8217;ve added to this thing, but we&amp;#8217;ve added a whole bunch. Here&amp;#8217;s an example. So when you scaffold out the block, all of your JavaScript files sit inside a SRC or a source folder. And people, they may not necessarily want that because they might already have a source folder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They might want to call it something like, so if you have an existing project, you might want to call it blocks instead of source. So what we did was we added the ability to be able to target that differently. So you could call it something else. And this works with the scripts package too. So you could define it a certain way and then have scripts look at that. Or one big feature that people were asking for was, we don&amp;#8217;t want to scaffold a plugin every single time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we have an existing plugin, we just want the block. So we built a no plugin mode where you could run it inside your source directory and it would just give you the block files. And now you&amp;#8217;ve got a second block inside that plugin. So those sort of things. And those all came from the community. They all came from people using the package and saying, this is stumbling block for us because we have to copy and paste and move things around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why can&amp;#8217;t we just add a command that does it? So we were able to add that stuff in and it&amp;#8217;s, I mean, I think it drives adoption, but it also. The whole point of this is to make people&amp;#8217;s lives easier. If it&amp;#8217;s more work to use the tool than it is to do it manually, then it&amp;#8217;s, I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s worth, you know, the juice isn&amp;#8217;t worth the squeeze, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:33:47] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s a good point. It just occurs to me that we never said where we find this tool. Do you happen to have a handy URL available?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:33:54] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, you can look in the developer.wordpress.org. I&amp;#8217;m not going to read the whole url, but just do a search for create block. All the documentation is available there. It&amp;#8217;s actually hosted on npm. So, I&amp;#8217;m sure we&amp;#8217;ll add it to the show notes, but the documentation is all there and it explains how to use it and all the available flags and all the available commands that you can do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s even a more advanced page on creating custom templates. I really love the custom template idea. Well, what do they call it? They call it external templates. External project templates is the official name. And what it allows you to do is like, if you&amp;#8217;re an agency and you want to build blocks in a very specific way, you can define that and then everyone in your agency is going to use that same template with this package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And you can use local packages, or you can host them on npm if you want to share them. It&amp;#8217;s very, very, very, very versatile. With that, the sky&amp;#8217;s the limit. You can literally do whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can scaffold the block to do anything, and then just target that particular sort of style of block. Like I built one that would do dynamic blocks because at the time the tool didn&amp;#8217;t support dynamic blocks, and now it does, by the way. My template is obsolete now, but that was a thing that we needed. So if you wanted to build a dynamic block, you would just target my template instead of the built-in one, and you would get that sort of flavor of block.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:35:06] Nathan Wrigley: You, mentioned a little while ago, maybe 20 minutes or so ago, that there was this dynamic block, and you said you might digress into that, but we never did. So let&amp;#8217;s go down that little path just for a moment, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:35:16] Ryan Welcher: Sure thing. So like I said before, there&amp;#8217;s two types of blocks. We have a static block and we have dynamic blocks. So a static block, the difference is basically where stuff is saved or if it&amp;#8217;s saved. So, in a static block. So all, I&amp;#8217;d say the majority of core blocks are static, meaning that when you hit save, it actually saves the markup into the post content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s saved to the database. A dynamic block doesn&amp;#8217;t do that. A dynamic block uses php to render the front end, the way we would always sort of, add run until the pages loaded and that file is run, and then it displays its information. And that&amp;#8217;s basically the difference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now there&amp;#8217;s some trade offs for both. With static blocks, when there&amp;#8217;s markup changes, you have to do this thing called deprecation. So you tell Gutenberg, if there&amp;#8217;s any developers listening, I&amp;#8217;m sure there are. If you&amp;#8217;ve ever seen that, like, you know, the block, we couldn&amp;#8217;t render the block. There was an error. Everyone&amp;#8217;s seen that error. That&amp;#8217;s because some markup has changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You need to deprecate that. So that&amp;#8217;s an extra step. Where with dynamic blocks, you don&amp;#8217;t need to do that because it&amp;#8217;s always run live, so to speak, right? So there&amp;#8217;s some benefits to using a dynamic block for that regard. But the trade out there is you have markup in two places. So that&amp;#8217;s, at a high level, the difference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:36:26] Nathan Wrigley: And the create block tool will point you in the right direction of creating one or the other, depending on which your.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:36:33] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, it lets you choose. So there is a flag called a variant, and you can choose between static or dynamic. I believe the default is static. It&amp;#8217;ll give you a static block if you don&amp;#8217;t run that flag. But if you say variant dynamic, it&amp;#8217;ll do a dynamic one. And then there&amp;#8217;s actually, within your templates, this is getting really the weeds, but if you define a template, you can actually have multiple variants. So you could have your own variant. You could have a TypeScript variant for your particular template. Or like a, I don&amp;#8217;t know, Tailwind CSS one. So there&amp;#8217;s a lot of flexibility there is where I&amp;#8217;m going with that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:37:03] Nathan Wrigley: Amazing. So much going on in the WordPress space at the moment. On every level. From straightforward to incredibly complicated. And feel this is on the incredibly complicated side, but really interesting work. You mentioned that you are obviously into this, but there were a couple of other names which came off your tongue earlier. I&amp;#8217;m wondering if in the round, you could just drop some of those names, people that we might like to go and find, as well as yourself, who are working with you, pushing the Create Block Tool.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:37:36] Ryan Welcher: There&amp;#8217;s the folks that I work with on my team. I&amp;#8217;m sure you&amp;#8217;ll know all these names. Birgit Pauli Haack is on the team. She&amp;#8217;s the Brains behind Gutenberg Times and all that stuff. Justin Tadlock is on the team as well. I&amp;#8217;m sure everyone knows Justin. There is Michael Burge who is on our team, and think that&amp;#8217;s it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:37:54] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. Well if there&amp;#8217;s any that you&amp;#8217;ve missed out, you can always fire them over in my direction and we&amp;#8217;ll make sure, that they get into the show notes. If anybody has been listening to this episode and they&amp;#8217;ve thought, you know what, this is curious. This is something that I need to begin to play with, but I would like to find out a little bit more first. We know you&amp;#8217;ve got the Twitch channel, and we&amp;#8217;ll push people towards that. But what other places can people get in touch with you Ryan?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:38:19] Ryan Welcher: Sure. I have a YouTube channel as well, so I&amp;#8217;m Ryan Welcher Codes in both places, Twitch and YouTube. I try to answer the comments on YouTube as often as possible, but sometimes I don&amp;#8217;t get to them right away, but I&amp;#8217;m at Ryan Welcher on Twitter and my DMs are open, so feel free.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m Welcher or Ryan Welcher or Welcher Ryan in a million different Slack channels. So, I think I&amp;#8217;m Welcher in Make Slack. I&amp;#8217;m on Post Status. I&amp;#8217;m on Discord in a few places. So just search my name or variations of my name and I&amp;#8217;m sure you&amp;#8217;ll run into me and, I&amp;#8217;d be happy to speak with anyone one-on-one in a public forum, whatever, whatever works.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:38:54] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you for making yourself available, and thank you for talking to us today about the Create Block Package stroke Tool. That&amp;#8217;s been really, really interesting. Ryan, thanks so much.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:39:04] Ryan Welcher: Thanks so much for having me and I hope I can come back sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the podcast today we have Ryan Welcher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ryan is a developer advocate sponsored by Automattic. He has been developing with WordPress since 2009 and before becoming a developer advocate, worked for agencies large and small and as a freelancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If youâve been using WordPress for any length of time, youâll have come across the new paradigm for content creation, blocks. Every part of your website can now be created and amended as a block. Pages, posts, text, images, headers, footers, navigation and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This has widened whatâs possible for people who donât want to mess around with the code of their website. You can add in blocks for almost anything, and change how it looks and behaves from within the block editor interface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent move forward, but thereâs still an impediment for non-technical people, because creating a block of your own is difficult. If you are able to use the selection of blocks that ship with WordPress Core, or you can find a third party block which does what you need, great, but if you need something specific, youâre going to have to create your own block solution, and that can be hard.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ryan is on the podcast today to tell you about the create-block tool, and how it can make your pathway towards block creation a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We start off talking about Ryanâs background, and how he became interested in WordPress. We then move on to how he thinks that the adoption of blocks is becoming more widespread given the maturing of the tools and learning materials available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The conversation then turns to how the create-block tool can help you scaffold your blocks. Itâs not a tool which is going to build the blocks for you, but it will help you set up the environment and build process, which you need to get started. Really, itâs all about saving you time and effort on things which donât really get you building your blocks, but which you need to do that work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We discuss what you can expect from the create-block tool, and the prior knowledge that youâll need to have once the tool has you up and running. What level of expertise do you need, and is the tool under continual development?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We spend a few moments talking about the livestreaming which Ryan does each week in which he live codes solutions to viewers block based problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If youâve thought about creating your own blocks, but have been put off by the technical barrier, this podcast is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Ollie Block Theme Now in Public Beta</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=143977</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/ollie-block-theme-now-in-public-beta</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress developer Mike McAlister has &lt;a href=&quot;https://olliewp.com/introducing-the-ollie-wordpress-block-theme/&quot;&gt;launched Ollie&lt;/a&gt;, his first block theme, into public beta. McAlister, whose theme company Array Themes was &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-array-themes&quot;&gt;acquired by WP Engine in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, along with the Atomic Blocks plugin, recently departed from his role at the company to pursue other projects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ollie supports all the latest Site Editor features, including global styles,&amp;nbsp;patterns,&amp;nbsp;templates,&amp;nbsp;and template parts. It is a beautiful, multipurpose theme of the high caliber one might expect from McAlister, a veteran developer whose past products were well known for their minimalist and clean design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ollie includes an impressive set of more than 50 custom block patterns, making page building a delight. There are page sections for testimonials, company logos, multiple hero designs, pricing tables, various headers and footers, calls to action, and more. Ollie includes six different full-page patterns for the homepage, about, profile, features, pricing, and a download page. They are featured on the theme&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://demo.olliewp.com/patterns/&quot;&gt;live demo&lt;/a&gt; under the Patterns menu item.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Ollie includes seven style variations, with blue, green, orange, pink, red, and teal accent color palettes in addition to the default. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like many other block themes, Ollie is speedy, getting top scores on Googleâs Pagespeed Insights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;One of the most powerful performance features is the selective loading of assets,&amp;#8221; McAlister said. &amp;#8220;Instead of loading a large stylesheet on every page, Ollie only loads the styles needed on the page. This results in a much smaller page size, far less page requests, and an instantly-loading page, which search engines love.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After testing Ollie, I found the user experience to be friendly and an accurate representation of one of the taglines for the theme: &amp;#8220;Get a 40 hour head start.&amp;#8221; As soon as users install the theme and click &amp;#8220;Customize,&amp;#8221; they are taken directly to the Site Editor with the front page template pre-populated to match the demo site. This, combined with all the improvements in the Site Editor in WordPress 6.2, creates a smooth editing experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although it hasn&amp;#8217;t been officially released yet, Ollie could be one of the next majorly successful block themes, with its sheer number of patterns and flexibility for so many different use cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ollie is currently &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OllieWP/ollie/&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; during the public beta but McAlister plans to get it approved for WordPress.org after more testing. He is not yet sure whether he will be jumping back into the commercial theme market.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;With this first block theme, my goal is simply to learn as much as possible about block themes, how users are using them, and what kind of potential there is for a premium offering,&amp;#8221; McAlister told the Tavern. &amp;#8220;This flagship theme will remain as an educational tool and will be free for all to use. Although I have some ideas for monetization, the reality is that we donât know much about how users will take to block themes or what kind of premium features theyâre willing to pay for yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Weâre very early in this new paradigm, so Iâm taking the opportunity to ask lots of questions learn about the problems users are facing. What I do know is that any modern commercial WordPress product needs a supreme customer experience and a wealth of quality education to help users navigate all of these new features and drive adoption.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WordPress.org has 286 block themes available and even the best ones have just a few thousand active installs. Building block themes that people will want to use is a new frontier, even for McAlister whose former company was a war-horse in the Classic Themes era.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Block themes are going to be a game changer for many different personas of WordPress users,&amp;#8221; McAlister said. &amp;#8220;Being able to customize virtually every aspect of your site is super powerful, but it means that block themes have a lot more moving parts than classic themes. Theme.json, global styles, patterns, templates, template parts â all of these have to be accounted for and they all have to work together seamlessly for an excellent block theme experience.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; WordPress theme developers are still getting a handle on these changes but the Themes Team is putting a stake in the ground by making block theming the focus of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2023/04/04/theme-handbook-overhaul-proposal/&quot;&gt;Theme Handbook overhaul&lt;/a&gt;. Although Classic Themes will still have a chapter in the handbook, the Themes Team has made it clear that block themes are &amp;#8220;the present and future of WordPress.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Since a lot of the block theme building is done in the editor, it requires a new mastery of the editor that few are intimately familiar with yet,&amp;#8221; McAlister said. &amp;#8220;To build patterns or layouts, you need to know which blocks to use, how to structure them effectively, how to leverage your design system in theme.json, and you need a good design sense to pull it all together. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;However, when it all finally comes together, block themes provide an unmatched site building and editing experience in comparison to classic themes. Iâm very optimistic about the opportunity to revitalize the WordPress theme space, but itâs going to take a lot of work and collective education to get there.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: CertifyWP Launches WordPress Management and Design Credential</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=143990</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/certifywp-launches-wordpress-management-and-design-credential</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;CertifyWP has launched its first credentialing exam for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://certifywp.com/design-and-development-credential/&quot;&gt;WordPress Management and Design Credential&lt;/a&gt;. The non-profit organization was founded by Talisha Lewallen with the goals of helping job seekers better demonstrate their skills to potential employers and giving businesses a way to understand prospective employees&amp;#8217; skills.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; The new credential costs $150 for the exam and includes three courses towards mastering frontend development: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://certifywp.com/design-and-development-credential/&quot;&gt;WordPress Management and Design Credential&lt;/a&gt;Â holders have validated their understanding of important aspects of WordPress and its websites. This credential is designed for anyone who wants to work in the WordPress space or learn to build WordPress websites. Once certified, these individuals are ready to pursue WordPress Web design, e-commerce, JavaScript, databases and other fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of items under the beginner and intermediate levels of the credential essentially describe a WordPress &amp;#8220;power user,&amp;#8221; or someone who knows their way around the platform and its more advanced features, including skills like navigating the admin panel, hosting, web optimization, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CertifyWP administers a proctored exam for the credential and those who meet the requirements will be required to re-take the exam every three years to maintain their credentialing. The exam will be updated as necessary by CertifyWP&amp;#8217;s advisory board.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are 110 questions in the exam, spread over three levels, as well as a practical component. The questions must be answered within 60 minutes with 80% for a passing score. Examinees do not have to take CertifyWP&amp;#8217;s course in order to be eligible for the exam &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s open to anyone who wants to take it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lewallen is also the owner of WPConnects, a company that helps military veterans get training while they are on active duty and then provides them with mentors and assistance with employment when they leave the military. In a recent WP Tavern Jukebox podcast &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/podcast/67-talisha-lewallen-on-how-certifywp-is-hoping-to-offer-wordpress-certification&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; she discussed how this work led to her starting CertifyWP with the help of the WordPress community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lewallen will also be speaking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://atarim.io/summit/&quot;&gt;Atarim&amp;#8217;s Web Agency Summit&lt;/a&gt; on April 25, about the importance of credentials in the WordPress workforce, the differences between credentials and certificates, and how credentials can be leveraged in the search for employment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:00]&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hello, everyone! And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Iâm your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40] Start of Show&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just over 50 episodes ago, I shared some basic thoughts about the four freedoms of open source. I also talked through the most quoted phrase in open source&amp;nbsp; âfree as in free speech, not free as in beer.â And honestly, what podcast about the freedoms of open source would be complete without that? If you haven&amp;#8217;t listened to that episode, I suggest you do, but if you don&amp;#8217;t have time, I&amp;#8217;ll start by reminding us all of the definition of free software, which is most commonly referred to as the four freedoms of open source.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:12]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So the first thing is the freedom to run the program as you wish for any purpose. The second thing is the freedom to study how the program works and to change it so that it does your computing as you wish. As a side note, access to the source code is a precondition for this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The third freedom is the freedom to redistribute copies so that you can help others. And the fourth freedom is the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes, and of course, also access to the source code is a precondition for this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:47]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The TLDR version of these freedoms is, essentially, that users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software. Now, normally when I speak about the freedoms of open source, I&amp;#8217;m talking about it either from a practical or a philosophical standpoint, but I also spend a lot of time thinking about it from a leadership and organizational perspective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, you might hear me talk about the effects of âopen source at scale,â or you might hear Matt say that the four freedoms are essentially the âBill of Rghts for the open web.â I almost never really dig into either of those topics because it&amp;#8217;s just really complicated. But for starters, anytime you talk about what someone is entitled to or deserves or expects, there is a feeling of political bias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:40]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while I personally believe that creating software is inherently political or, at a minimum, concerned with the needs of people, that&amp;#8217;s not what convinces anyone to participate in open source, and it&amp;#8217;s certainly not what convinces people to use WordPress. But here&amp;#8217;s the thing, as a leader in a widely used, free, and open source software project, as a leader in WordPress, I also know that every new user to our platform or any other open source platform represents a little more freedom in the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A little more access to tools and jobs that weren&amp;#8217;t available before. A slightly more open door to networks that undergird the success of entrepreneurs across the globe and a little more equity to the world of democratizing publishing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:28]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I look at the four freedoms of open source, this Bill of Rights for the Web, I see not only the freedoms that we should have but also the things that we should have freedom from.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We should have the freedom to know how our tools work, the freedom to know what information they need from us, and also the freedom to have some way to make that software work specifically for us because that&amp;#8217;s why we have software because we have humans that need it. But we should also have freedom from having to hide our hacky enhancements or freedom from fear of losing our earned audience, or even the fear of losing access to copious amounts of content that we have created ourselves over the years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:13]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And honestly, the things that we should be free from just include a lot of fear of loss. Loss of opportunity or relevance or livelihood. And I feel like for our project, and maybe for open source as a whole, we&amp;#8217;re encountering a lot of that right now, whether we are aware of it or not. We&amp;#8217;re seeing advancements like GPT3 or ChatGPT if that sounds more familiar and co-pilot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while it&amp;#8217;s not quite in the same vein, also things like Gutenberg. Advancements that are coming to technology around us, technology we&amp;#8217;re familiar with. And it&amp;#8217;s hard to see what&amp;#8217;s in them sometimes. It&amp;#8217;s hard to see what drives them. It&amp;#8217;s hard to know how we can make them work for us. So I have to remind us all, as citizens of an open source community, that what protects us from those things we should be free from is directly connected to how active we are in the things we are free to.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We hear that in a slightly more routine way from folks around open source communities. Basically, the whole concept of open source software is being built by the folks who show up. You can&amp;#8217;t influence the future of anything if you&amp;#8217;re not showing up in the spaces where the influence happens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:35]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So be an active participant in these new technologies. Learn how GPT works and how it could work for you, even if it&amp;#8217;s just writing better prompts. Learn how Gutenberg can support your needs, not subvert your needs, even if it&amp;#8217;s just learning how to arrange a series of blocks into a pattern or patterns into a page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But as with all fast-moving technological advances, I encourage you to leap in feet first, not head first. Get in up to your neck in the &amp;#8220;why&amp;#8221;s and &amp;#8220;how&amp;#8221;s of that new technology you&amp;#8217;ve been worrying about. Be the first to become best at this arcane new thing because that&amp;#8217;s why we open source at all so that you have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve your software.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:33] Small List of Big Things&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That brings me now to my small list of big things. It&amp;#8217;s a very small list, but it is very big, as always. The first thing is that we are gearing up for the remaining major releases of the year, WP 6.3 and 6.4 in an atypical moment for our project. You can volunteer for both simultaneously if you want, and hopefully, you do want.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second thing is that there are many ways to celebrate WordPress&amp;#8217;s 20th anniversary on May 27th. But one of the things you can do right now is record a short video or sound clip about a great memory or experience you have had in this community or just generally because of WordPress. Those will be featured on the WP 20 website, and maybe even a lucky few will make it into the second volume of the WordPress history book.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&amp;#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&amp;#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p class=&quot;has-large-font-size&quot;&gt;Transcript&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: Hello, and welcome to our 82nd episode of the Gutenberg Changelog Podcast. In today&amp;#8217;s episode, we will talk about the Gutenberg plugin version 15.6, the proposed schedule for WordPress 6.3, and a few things that are in the works again. I&amp;#8217;m your host Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source Project. I&amp;#8217;m thrilled to have with me today, co-host Nick Diego, plugin developer, core contributor as well, and we are both part of Automatticâs Five for the Future project. Nick and I teamed up to manage the Gutenberg plugin release 15.6, so this is fresh from the press, so to speak. Thanks for joining me today again at the Gutenberg Changelog. Nick, how are you today?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: I&amp;#8217;m doing great. I&amp;#8217;m very excited that 15.6 is out in the wild now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack:&lt;/em&gt; Yeah, me too. And this is a daily dose of Nick Diego for me because the last two days we were in communication about the release.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Announcements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But before we head into the Gutenberg 15.6 release, let&amp;#8217;s do a few announcements from the WordPress project. As mentioned in the intro, the release schedule for WordPress 6.3 proposal is published and includes a call for volunteers for the release squad. A beta is proposed to be, beta one, is proposed to be on June 27th, 2023. So it&amp;#8217;s after WordCamp and âafter afterâ WordCamp, so to speak, WordCamp Europe. Release candidate and dev notes. Deadline is proposed for July 18th, 2023, and then the final release is proposed to be scheduled on August 8th, 2023. So you raised your hand right, Nick? I raised my hand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: I did. Yeah. Yes, exactly. So yeah, I&amp;#8217;ve been in the editor triage lead for the last three-year releases and it was a new role when I started. I&amp;#8217;d love to help somebody grow into that role because I love doing it, but we want to see other people in that role as well. And I think it&amp;#8217;s a fun role. It&amp;#8217;s pretty unique. Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s not very technical. It&amp;#8217;s more organizational and just engaging with other release leads and kind of keeping everything moving smoothly. So it&amp;#8217;s a great lead for somebody who maybe is not as technical but wants to really engage with the release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah. Yeah, I want to change my role. The last three releases, I did documentation pieces and especially the Gutenberg dev notes wrangle them through GitHub and that is definitely something that somebody that is not technical can do as well. I&amp;#8217;m open to mentor somebody for 6.3 and the proposal for the schedule comes actually on the heels of Josepha Haden Chomphosyâs post, which preparing for the next women and non-binary release squad, AKA underrepresented gender squad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And if you want to be part of it, you can raise your hands in the comments there. And of course we have the links and show notes, but if you haven&amp;#8217;t worked on the major WordPress release squad before, it would be really good and you want to be part of the underrepresented gender squad, it would be good that you also look at the schedule for 6.3 and raise your hand there because quite a few mentors would be available to skill up contributors to be part of 6.4 because that&amp;#8217;s how you get new people in that you need to&amp;#8230; We need to shepherd them through the responsibilities and how things work and who to talk to and how this all&amp;#8230; It can be very intimidating when you haven&amp;#8217;t done this before.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So not to throw you into the deep end of the water to swim.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: It&amp;#8217;s always good to see how the sausage is made and there&amp;#8217;s so much going on and so many people involved. I know when I first did it, I was very intimidated, but after you see it once, it starts to make a bit more sense. So yeah, mentor for 6.3 and then get really well-prepared for 6.4.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah. Yeah. And if you want to learn more, yeah, you find us on Twitter or on the WordPress Slack and you can just kind of DM us or ask us some questions there. Well, I volunteered you now. Big sorry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah. Oh, if anybody has any questions about the release, feel free to reach out to us. We&amp;#8217;re here to help, here to get more people on board with the release. I know for myself, it kind of kicked off my journey in contributing more to WordPress and it really made me kind of fall in love with the process. And so I highly encourage anybody else who might be even a little bit interested to start exploring it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: And if you want to help the quality race on some of the products, you can also follow the FSE outreach program that has been in place for two and a half years almost. And there is, Anne McCarthy runs the program and you still have until April 26th to follow the testing call number 20. And that is using the create block theme plugin to create a block theme and you get some instructions on the call for testing. It&amp;#8217;s another six days, but if you are not so much into theme development, maybe you want to do the new call for testing that just came out and have some front page fun with a block scene and create some templates that are for the front page. And there is actually also a developer news blog out, blog post out that just came out last week, and that is by Justin Tadlock using the template patterns to build multiple homepage designs. So I don&amp;#8217;t know exactly if they&amp;#8217;re related, but I&amp;#8217;m pointing you to it as well, so you get a little bit broader picture of it. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: And I want to stress that these call for testings, even if you&amp;#8217;ve been building with blocks forever and you&amp;#8217;re very engaged, it&amp;#8217;s a great exercise to go through. I consider myself very entrenched in WordPress and know what&amp;#8217;s going on, but sometimes when you go through these testing calls, you find pitfalls or issues that somebody who&amp;#8217;s maybe brand new to blocks would encounter. It&amp;#8217;s a great way to find problems or things that can be fixed to make that onboarding experience smoother. So I know I always find things that I don&amp;#8217;t expect, but the goal of these call for testing is to make WordPress better. And so even if you use WordPress every day, I encourage you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s a good point. Absolutely. And if I want to get something done on my theme, for instance, for the Gutenberg Times or for my personal blog and try to do this, I always find something that might be a little quirky, that might be a little bit, oh, I haven&amp;#8217;t thought about that, but now that I use it, maybe there are some things that could be easier to handle or more intuitive or I run into some problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s so fresh from out of the releases that there&amp;#8217;s always&amp;#8230; There is no bug free software. That ship has sailed when we so many people are involved. All right.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah. But that&amp;#8217;s also something if I get asked, I want to contribute to WordPress, but I don&amp;#8217;t know how. So I&amp;#8217;ll appoint them to the testing calls because it&amp;#8217;s gets them hands-on with the WordPress site and also contribute back by just giving feedback. You don&amp;#8217;t have to know the processes. You don&amp;#8217;t need to know any development, but when something doesn&amp;#8217;t work right and you can raise your hand and say, I found something and explain that to other people. And Anne has been very good in creating GitHub issues for the developers and to feed that back into the development process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Contributions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: For the community contribution, I wanted to point out Ryan Welcher started a new series on his Twitch stream and it&amp;#8217;s called Bring Me Your Issues. And he uploaded the first of the few issues for persistence on YouTube, and I wanted to point you to it. He also went through the work and added chapter timestamps to it, and especially for the first one that was really helpful because that&amp;#8217;s a two and a half hour Twitch session. I really admire his persistence and his patience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So you can look through the list of the topics that he covered and one of them&amp;#8230; So I can only say three things, but that it was more so how to use the create block scaffolding tool. It&amp;#8217;s always interesting to see that and how to build an edit block for the lockdown user. So edit post block I should say. And that&amp;#8217;s certainly something that could come to core, but if it&amp;#8217;s easier&amp;#8230; Yeah, relatively easy to build, you can build it yourself. Then he answers the question, what and why inner blocks, which is a component that is for block building. And then another question is how to create a placeholder and parent and child relationships for your block development and using the example of a post pickup block. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: It&amp;#8217;s a goldmine of tools and how to do different things, so if you haven&amp;#8217;t checked out Ryan&amp;#8217;s streams, you definitely should.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, and there&amp;#8217;s a second edition of it, where you can learn more about the get post type selectors in the data store and the use entity records, all technical terms, that you will know so easy after you listen to that. The render appender, I like that. The render appender on the inner box. And then in the third edition here, Ryan also talks a little bit over the Gutenberg 15.5 release and how to create a external template for APIs for the great block scaffolding tool. Always a good thing to know so you can create your own templates for the tool. There was actually also a topic at one of our Gutenberg live Q&amp;amp;As was Grzegorz Ziolkowski and Fabian Kagy. It&amp;#8217;s a couple of years old, but it&amp;#8217;s still very, very current with demos and additional background on how to create those templates. So we share all this in the show notes. I know it&amp;#8217;s a little bit tech and developer happy, heavy, happy too, but I just wanted to point out these new resources and additional resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: So GiveWP published a block-based visual donation form builder. That&amp;#8217;s a mouthful, and it&amp;#8217;s in beta. So GiveWP has, in an earlier episode, we discussed GiveWP&amp;#8217;s way to rebuild the powerful donation plugin with our block first mindset and starting off with a WordPress native components and scripts to build the interface and only use custom code to augment it. And the visual donation form builder, it&amp;#8217;s getting better, is the first product that comes from this effort. And if you work for an agency that helps nonprofits fundraise using the GiveWP Plugin, this beta is definitely for you. It&amp;#8217;s also for you when you are working at a nonprofit organization and you are responsible for the fundraising and creating the campaign-related forms. This is also a beta for you. So it gives you early insight in what&amp;#8217;s coming to GiveWP in the version 3.0. And it also gives you a better feel for what will be possible with a new form builder that isn&amp;#8217;t available right now. So check it out, GiveWP. We have the link definitely in the show notes to the beta announcement, and that&amp;#8217;s it from our community contributions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Lots of good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatâs Released &amp;#8211; Gutenberg 15.6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah. So what&amp;#8217;s released this week? We have Gutenberg 15.6 and we are coming right from it. It was released yesterday and the release post is also available now. It includes a total of 112 PRs. It&amp;#8217;s a smaller release in comparison to the ones that come closer to a major WordPress release. It was authored by 45 contributors and seven of which were new contributors. So congratulations everyone on the good work and let&amp;#8217;s get into what&amp;#8217;s in there. And we&amp;#8217;re starting out with, we now have spacing presets to the spacer block.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, this is what I&amp;#8217;m so excited about. We&amp;#8217;ve had&amp;#8230; Since 6.1, presets were added to WordPress, which allow you to do a little slider for margin and padding and block app. It&amp;#8217;s configuring margin or padding can be kind of complicated, but when you have a preset of small, medium, large or 1-2-3-4-5, it just makes it a little bit easier for the user. And the way that you could apply those, is you could actually make them fluid, using clamp to make them fluid, which allows for really interesting designs that don&amp;#8217;t require media queries because you can make all your one margin for desktop, another for mobile. We didn&amp;#8217;t have that for the spacer block, which adds vertical height between different blocks. So if you had a hundred pixel spacer block, you wanted it to be smaller on mobile, you would need to use custom CSS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, now spacing presets come to the spacer block, which also in turn allows for fluid spacer blocks, which people have been asking for forever. Because the spacer block is such a natural tool. It&amp;#8217;s so easy to add for end users. It makes sense. I want to add some space between these two items. Okay, add the spacer block, but now that they&amp;#8217;re fluid&amp;#8230; Now that you can make them fluid, it allows for dynamic websites where you have one size on desktop, another for tablet and another for mobile. And it&amp;#8217;s all on this fluid spectrum and you don&amp;#8217;t need media queries. You don&amp;#8217;t need anything else. You&amp;#8217;re just using these spacing presets. So I couldn&amp;#8217;t be more excited. I&amp;#8217;ve only have just began exploring this and I know other theme developers are as well, so exciting stuff.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: Awesome. Yeah, thank you so much for telling us about it. I also want to point out a blog post that&amp;#8217;s on the developer blog and it kind of talks about that fluid part of intrinsic design versus media queries for theming and thinking about how designing WordPress makes it a little bit more modern when you&amp;#8230; Because the proliferation of screen sizes, you are probably not very content with just three media or three sets. You might need 12 sets or 6 sets, and who keeps track of all the different settings for all these presets? Intrinsic design, that&amp;#8217;s a fluid typography. That&amp;#8217;s a fluid spacing. It&amp;#8217;s definitely a way to go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#8217;t say that you cannot have any media queries, but it&amp;#8217;s definitely for the strategic way to build websites. It&amp;#8217;s the way to go now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: And then we had, the cover block had border support, but now you also have these pop over resizable box and I think it also was in 15.5, but cover block has now a great border support. You can have the radios. You can have the colors. You can have the resizable block kind of&amp;#8230; Resizable blocks adhered to those. Yeah, that was really nice when I tested it. I&amp;#8217;m not quite sure that&amp;#8217;s 5.6 native, but it&amp;#8217;s definitely improved with 15.6&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: In 16.1, we did a huge effort to add all these design tools to most blocks, but border was left off a handful of them. One of them being cover block because of the clipping so if you did a background image and you tried to put border radius on it, you&amp;#8217;d need to use overflow. It just became tricky with CSS and it took some more time to figure out how to implement that correctly. And so we finally got there and I think that this has been one of those things, why isn&amp;#8217;t there border control? I thought, well, it was a little more tricky than we expected. So it&amp;#8217;s nice to see it here and it really opens up a lot of designs and again, removes some extra custom CSS that you may have needed in the past to achieve a specific design.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: So next thing on the list of change of was, add styles section to the&amp;#8230; Well, they call it browse mode sidebar, but it&amp;#8217;s the style editor of the style. Well, somebody called it site editor dark side as well, so which I don&amp;#8217;t feel slightly better. It&amp;#8217;s the left sidebar that is on the site editor. And now there is a style section where you can see all the styles that come with the theme, the style variations, and when you click on it, you see how your site changes, but there&amp;#8217;s also an edit button there. So you can then go and open up the right side and change some of the settings for the style variation. And that is a very fluid workflow. I really love that. And it&amp;#8217;s now in the Gutenberg plugin, so it&amp;#8217;s really cool.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Before you had to know where the style variations were. You had to click into the template, then go to the style panel. And so this just makes it much more surfaced for users, allowing you to easily switch your style variation out. Great improvement, and also that name to be determined left-hand sidebar. That will get more features as we go on as well. But this is one additional addition beyond templates and template parts and navigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: Those are the four main items right now. Yeah, navigation, global styles, template and template parts. And there might be a pattern in the future.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Hopefully.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: Hopefully. Yes, yes, yes. And then in Gutenberg 15.6, there&amp;#8217;s also two experiments. One is a new block that the details and summary block, which mostly was working by Carolina Nymark and she did a fantastic job, shepherding that for maybe a year until it actually got merged as an experiment into the plugin. It&amp;#8217;s how you can hide things. You write a movie review and you want to hide the spoiler part where you reveal some of the drama in the movie, but you want your users to know or readers to know that you making a choice here. You open it up and it&amp;#8217;s a spoiler. You can also hide some details on certain things. There are numerous of use cases and it&amp;#8217;s quite nice because it has all the design tools. It has the typography. It has the spacing. It has the backgrounds, the colors. So it&amp;#8217;s actually a nice little block and it can use some testing, but you need to go to the menu of the Gutenberg plugin into the experiments and check it on. Yeah. Have you used it Nick?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, I played around with it quite a bit. I think that the colloquial term would be an accordion, is basically kind of what we&amp;#8217;re talking about here. It&amp;#8217;s really hard to do in an accessible way, which is one of the reasons why this has taken so long to get into WordPress. Core, that is. And so I think Carolina did a great job. The current experimental implementation includes a number of a parent block and then a number of child blocks. There&amp;#8217;s another exploration that&amp;#8217;s maybe trying to simplify that. But either way, we&amp;#8217;re getting closer and closer to having this block and core and it&amp;#8217;s something that everybody&amp;#8217;s asked for. So why isn&amp;#8217;t this in core? We want this in core. So it&amp;#8217;s, it will get there and I think this is a great first step. Encourage everybody to try out the experiment. Find problems with it. Find out how we can make it better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah. Excellent. And then there&amp;#8217;s another experiment. It&amp;#8217;s called a command center for the site editor. And that is really a rough interface right now if you switch it on. Yeah, don&amp;#8217;t expect too much user-friendliness in there because it&amp;#8217;s still in an experimental way. So if I understood this correctly, you get a little search bar like the spotlight on a Mac or so, and then you can say edit something or change color or so and it will get you to the place where you can actually do that. So you wouldn&amp;#8217;t need to know all the 15 levels of menus to get to a certain place. I have not played with it. Did you test it a bit?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Yes, so we&amp;#8217;ve been all hearing about artificial intelligence these days. AI is everywhere, and this is not AI, but it&amp;#8217;s an experiment to start exploring one, how you can move things around. How you can move around the site. You could tell it, I want to add a new page, but you can also start to see where in the future you could hook in&amp;#8230; third-party extenders could hook in a different additional functionality into this command center to do, write me a post about Mars, whatever. You can start to think about where this could eventually go, which is why this is currently an experiment, but the baseline is going to be take me to the styles panel, add a new page, simple things. But it could be huge. It could be a really important component of what WordPress is. And so really test it out, start exploring it. The idea behind it is it&amp;#8217;s going to be very extensible, so you can add additional functionality as a third-party extender. So really excited to see where this goes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, me too. And then there are quite a few, I call them or we call them here, quality of life kind of enhancements you don&amp;#8217;t know that you need it until you see that what you get. And one of them is the smoother animations for the drop zone and what is a drop zone? It&amp;#8217;s not a movie thing. You go from drag and drop and to drop, you need to know where you itâs is actually going on your canvas and the animation that&amp;#8230; So there&amp;#8217;s a blue line appearing on your canvas and it tells you, okay, your drop thingy will drop here when you release the button if you wanted to. And the animations are much smoother. It&amp;#8217;s actually a delightful experience now to drag and drop blocks from one section to the other or from the list view over&amp;#8230; From the list view over to your canvas. So that&amp;#8217;s a very nice addition there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s really nice. And then there&amp;#8217;s some improvements to list view itself around dragging. I&amp;#8217;ve run into it too. You see sometimes you drag items within the list view and itâs&amp;#8230; Things don&amp;#8217;t go exactly where you want them to. And one of those was dragging underneath a container like a group block was a little challenging. And then they&amp;#8217;ve improved that as well. So dragging and dropping and got it much easier across the board.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, and that I think were all the highlights that we wanted to point out today from the Gutenberg 15.6 release. We will have the release post in the show notes so you can follow up on things.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatâs in Active Development or Discussed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And now we want to talk to you about what&amp;#8217;s in active development and what&amp;#8217;s coming down the line. And first off is the work with patterns. So I hear this over and over again. I want to create my own patterns. Why can&amp;#8217;t I do this with WordPress? I need a plugin. And we know all the good plugins. There&amp;#8217;s a, Justin Tadlock had a plugin to create patterns and Block Meister was one, and then WP Engine came out with a pattern builder. And so Ari has a work in progress to add UI to allow saving patterns. And we definitely share that and it&amp;#8217;s coming along fine, but it&amp;#8217;s still a work in progress. And I don&amp;#8217;t know what are the problems they&amp;#8217;re hitting? Do you have a feeling on how that&amp;#8217;s difficult?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Well, I think it&amp;#8217;s one of those things where we have all sorts of different entities in the block editor. We have reusable blocks. We have templates. We have template parts. What do you use when? What do you use where? And so I think that not only the functionality of being able to save a pattern, but also the UI around saving a pattern and making it clear to users when you should use one over the other and in what context things should be used. So there&amp;#8217;s a technical issue and then there&amp;#8217;s also a UI understanding user experience issue as well. So it&amp;#8217;s getting there. It&amp;#8217;s great to see this happening in core patterns are such a great way to create content and then use it in different places. And being able to do that in core would be such a huge benefit. It would allow you to design something, save it as a pattern, go to a different page, use your pattern. There&amp;#8217;s just so many delightful applications of this and really excited to see it moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, it definitely needs to be in there. And there&amp;#8217;s also a work done on the WP pattern block, which allows you to create patterns or use patterns in template parts. So that&amp;#8217;s also reusable designs that are already available to use them in templates, so you can reuse, have them on every type of page that you want to be on. That is also in the works. It definitely comes together with the UI for the patterns as well. So look out, we have the links for the PRs, will be in the show notes, so if you want to check it out and keep a tab on it, feel free to do those.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, and I think that the long and short of it is patterns are under the hood a very simple thing. It&amp;#8217;s just a collection of blocks. And the initial implementation of patterns was just that. It was a collection of blocks that you could deploy in different places. Now that people are starting to expand and adopt block-based WordPress, it&amp;#8217;s become very clear how powerful patterns can be. And now we&amp;#8217;re seeing all these like, well, can it do this? Can it do this? Can we do it here? Yeah. And so we&amp;#8217;re trying to address those things.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: And I just want to&amp;#8230; Just had the idea, we talked about pattern before and I pitched that developer news post where you can have patterns for particular templates, and that&amp;#8217;s also part of that idea where you can expand. How you can use it. How can theme developers support users in creating what they need to create on their websites and be fast with that? Yeah. So that&amp;#8217;s also part, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another thing that was definitely had a lot of questions and a lot of requests was getting revisions on the global styles for the interface. So contributors look to implement revisions and display them in the global styles. There&amp;#8217;s current and experimental implementation that shows a separate revision menu item in the global styles. And when you selected, you can see the latest revisions, the preview of them in the editor, and you can also go back to the latest revision and change it again. Or there is also a restore of unsafe changes and also a reset to the science of the theme. So there was, the design team did lot of thinking about how that can be displayed. And now developers are working on some iterations on the PR before it&amp;#8217;s merged. And it will certainly need some thorough testing, but I wanted listeners to know that that is coming as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, revisions are such a big thing when you make those changes in the site editor can be a little discerning because you&amp;#8217;re like, I&amp;#8217;m making all these changes. How do I get back? How do I get back to a design that I liked before and it was clicking the back button a million times or just a little&amp;#8230; It was tough. So there&amp;#8217;s a revision, especially visual revisions where you can go back and see what the changes that were made I think is going to be really important for broader adoption of the site editor. So great to see.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, definitely. And when users do make their own designs or make changes on their design, sometimes they don&amp;#8217;t know what the final design looks like until they actually have it and then they don&amp;#8217;t like it anymore and then they need to go back and that these revisions definitely will help with that process. I&amp;#8217;m that way. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Oh, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: And the last item that I have in the list for, or we have in the list for you to learn that is discussed and in the works is again, a little bit more developer oriented, but now there is a PR one issue discussed on how to get allowed blocks into the blockchain meta. It is an attribute for the inner block. So if you have a custom block and you want other blocks in there, you can restrict which blocks can be put in there, but you are not able to add this to your&amp;#8230; A data point to your outside block. And that is something especially for developers that restrict them or they find solutions around it. And if you&amp;#8230; Yeah, one is if you want to restrict an instance of the media and text block, that it only can do heading, paragraph, and image, but you can tell the media and text block that is what you want them to put in there. So developers do all kinds of interesting things to work around this, but there should be a standard in core and the developers are working on it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, I&amp;#8217;d love to see this extensibility. When the block editor is being built, obviously, you need the core components to be built, but I think we&amp;#8217;re finally out of time where a lot of things are stable and now is really how do we allow people to make changes, extend different components. One of the beauties of WordPress. You can change anything. You can configure it in many ways and getting some of that configurability into more configurability into the block editor is great. So these little things that may seem minor have huge impacts for developers&amp;#8217; lives and what they&amp;#8217;re trying to implement. So great to see this happening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: And I was thinking about, well, this is an issue that&amp;#8217;s discussed for four years now. And finally there are enough use cases, there have been enough ways to use the block editor and extend an editor, and now there&amp;#8217;s a real need there to actually have that discussion come to fruition into a PR or into a new feature that helps the developers to extend things. And I think we will see through the year of 2023, the next two major WordPress releases, certainly additional things that add more extensibility to the block editor, especially to the site editor and to custom blocks. And it&amp;#8217;s exciting times and I&amp;#8217;m really glad that we are there now just before the next phase of Gutenberg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah, absolutely. And with that, dear listeners, we are at the end of the show. It was a shorter show, but I&amp;#8217;m glad I had Nick with me for you and could talk to you about a few things that are beyond the Gutenberg plugin release.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So before the end of the show. I remind you if you want to help WordPress get better, heed the call for testing, either building a block theme with a block plugin in the 20th testing call or rating front pages, different kind of front page for your website. So anything else that you want to add to things that we haven&amp;#8217;t talked about that you were top of your mind?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: No, just encourage people to go check out 15.6 and that call for testing. Embrace blocks and try to push the block editor to his limits. And if there are issues, let us know and we&amp;#8217;ll help make it better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: All right, so you changed jobs, Nick? Have anything but you are not new to our listeners. That&amp;#8217;s why we kind of cut through the introduction a little bit. But have anything&amp;#8230; If people want to get in touch with you, has anything changed?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Nope. The best place usually is just on Twitter or obviously WordPress Slack at NDiego. On Twitter, NickMDiego. So feel free to reach out to me with your questions, comments, suggestions about WordPress. Here to help.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: And we have a new video of you, Fluid Spaces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Yeah, I&amp;#8217;m going to make more of those. I&amp;#8217;m going to be trying to do more little shorts about different features that come out in WordPress so we&amp;#8217;ll see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit Pauli-Haack&lt;/em&gt;: And the first one is out today and we will have the link in the show notes and it talks about the spacers, spacer block. And so let Nick know what you think about and what your ideas are for new little shorts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As always, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is the 82nd edition or episode. And if you have questions or suggestions or news you want to send, include them to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com&quot;&gt;changelog@gutenbergtimes.com&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:changelog@Gutenbergtimes.com&quot;&gt;changelog@Gutenbergtimes.com&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you everybody, and I wish you a great weekend and a new weekend of spring eternal. Hopefully, and the weather getting better and talk to you in two weeks. Bye-bye.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Diego&lt;/em&gt;: Bye-bye.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: Virtuozzo Launches Version 2.0 of Its Application Platform for WordPress</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=143923</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/virtuozzo-launches-version-2-0-of-its-application-platform-for-wordpress</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Virtuozzo, the software company behind the virtualization and cloud management capabilities of many popular hosting service providers, has launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virtuozzo.com/company/blog/wordpress-as-a-service-the-new-kind/&quot;&gt;version 2.0&lt;/a&gt; of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtuozzo.com/application-platform-for-wordpress/&quot;&gt;WordPress platform&lt;/a&gt;. The company&amp;#8217;s 450+ customers include GoDaddy, IONOS, InMotion hosting, and other hosts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Virtuozzo&amp;#8217;s WordPress platform  enables service providers to sell containerized hosting as a service. The most recent update introduces a new user interface designed for WordPress customers that makes it easy to configure resources, adjust scaling, pay invoices, and deploy WordPress websites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Version 2.0 of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://virtuozzo.com/application-platform-for-wordpress/&quot;&gt;Virtuozzo Application Platform for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; includes automatic scaling up or down in response to traffic spikes, the ability to offer consumption-based pricing, automated WordPress deployment for single instances to multi-region clusters, and efficient hardware utilization with fully isolated containers and automatic failover. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new platform makes it possible for any hosting provider to offer some of the same features that more expensive managed hosts provide. Virtuozzo pioneered the platform with &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.azpocket.co.jp/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AzPocket&lt;/a&gt;, a Japanese WordPress host, as the first adopter, who used it to expand the features of its shared hosting offerings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;âThere is a significant gap in the WordPress hosting market, between cheap shared or VPS hosting services, and more expensive managed WordPress from companies such as WP Engine and Kinsta,&amp;#8221; Virtuozzo VP of Strategic Product Development Carlos Rego said. &amp;#8220;Our solution enables any service provider to offer modern, containerized WordPress-as-a-Service at a fraction of the cost of those âpremiumâ providers.âÂ &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Virtuozzo will be hosting a webinar on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virtuozzo.com/sell-wordpress-as-a-service-brand-new-ux/&quot;&gt;how to sell premium WordPress hosting&lt;/a&gt;Â on May 4, 2023, at 11AM EDT/ 5PM CET. Planned topics include the opportunity for hosting in the WordPress market, the drawbacks of current hosting products, and how to create a &amp;#8220;WordPress as a Service business in a box.&amp;#8221; Virtuozzo representatives will demo the new WordPress platform and answer questions from attendees at the conclusion of the event.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Gutenberg Times: Custom CSS, front page fun, Gutenberg outside of WordPress â Weekend Edition #251</title>

	<link>https://gutenbergtimes.com/custom-css-front-page-fun-gutenberg-outside-of-wordpress-weekend-edition-251/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy, &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although, I found great content for you  and I was co-leading the Gutenberg plugin release, it felt like a quiet week. No family drama, no moving stress. Nowadays, I cherish the quiet moments, when I can sit and read a book, that&amp;#8217;s not technical in nature. Or just sit with loved once and chat about life, or go for a walk along the Rhine. Or take a stroll through Tinguely Museum. What are your moments of quiet, you cherish, and you don&amp;#8217;t have enough of? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tinguely.ch/en.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tinguely.ch/en.html&quot;&gt;MÃ©ta-Harmonie II &amp;#8211; Tinguely Museum&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will all change again next week, I am confident. ð¤·ð»ââï¸&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How was your week? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, you can take a quiet moment for reading through this newsletter. Enjoy&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yours, ð&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, &lt;strong&gt;Gutenberg 15.6&lt;/strong&gt; was released. Nick Diego and I were leading the release and published the release post: &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/04/19/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15-6-19-april/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whatâs new in Gutenberg 15.6?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Diego &lt;/strong&gt;and I also recorded the &lt;strong&gt;Gutenberg Changelog episode 82&lt;/strong&gt; together and discussed not only the latest release but also what&amp;#8217;s in the works, like revisions for Global Styles, or a Pattern creator. It was a great pleasure speaking with Nick again on the podcast. The episode 82 will arrive at your favorite podcast app over the weekend. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Daily doses Nick Diego&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wes Theron&lt;/strong&gt; posted a video on &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.tv/2023/04/18/building-a-page-with-only-patterns/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a page with only&amp;nbsp;patterns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In this demo, he used a variety of patterns to create a Services Page. Patterns allow you to add beautifully designed, ready-to-go layouts to any WordPress site with a simple insert or copy/paste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jasontheadams&quot;&gt;Jason Adams,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; announced &lt;strong&gt;GiveWP&amp;#8217;S  Block based: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://givewp.com/visual-donation-form-builder-beta/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Donation Form Builder in Beta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We discussed in an earlier edition that GiveWP is rebuilding their powerful Donation plugin with a block first mindset. The revamp started off with the WordPress own components and scripts to build the interface, and the GiveWP team augmented it with custom code where necessary. &amp;nbsp;The Visual donation Form Builder is the first product to come from this effort.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paRW3BWsdgw&quot;&gt;More info is also available on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you work at an agency that helps their nonprofits fundraise using the GiveWP plugin, this beta test is for you. Furthermore, if you work at a nonprofit organization and are responsible for fundraising and building campaign related forms for your website, this beta test is for you. It gives you an early insight into what coming to GiveWP with its 3.0 version, and also a better feel for what will be possible with the new form builder that isnât available right now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class=&quot;wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide&quot; /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Munir Kamal&lt;/strong&gt; released his &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.gutenberghub.com/ai-writer/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Writer on Gutenberg Hub Shop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211;  plugin that integrates ChatGPT into the Gutenberg canvas. Your writing prompt is return with content, and then you can also ask for some rewrites, translate into various languages. You would need an OpenAI API key to enable the plugin, after you paid and installed the plugin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are now &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/&quot;&gt;282 Block Themes in the WordPress repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Here are three you could test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/themes/ctlg/&quot;&gt;CTLG&lt;/a&gt; by Automattic, specifically designed for creating lists, directories, and catalogs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s the difference between a block theme and a classic theme? &lt;strong&gt;Jamie Marsland&lt;/strong&gt; explains it in a few minutes in this video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ1kruAnQso&amp;t=1s&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress Block Themes vs Classic Themes: A Beginners Guide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it cannot reasonably cover every scenario and still have a matching design tool in the editor UI, which is an important consideration. If the interface covered every possibility, the user experience would suffer.&amp;#8221; Tadlock wrote. He also answers the question, why not add everything to a style.css and be done with it. Learn how to add custom CSS per block. Tadlock also added a few thoughts on pitfalls, and has some tips and tricks for you. &lt;/p&gt;

They discussed Gutenberg, but not how you might expect. Itâs Gutenberg outside of WordPress, but Gutenberg nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recording of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.tv/2023/04/18/developer-hours-introduction-to-the-interactivity-api/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer Hours: Introduction to the Interactivity API&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/c_z_a_p_l_a&quot;&gt;Michal Czaplinski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is now available on WordPressTV. It featured a live product demo of the Interactivity API.  Michal is one of the developers on the team that brought the Interactivity API to fruition. Following the demo, Michal answered attendees&amp;#8217; questions. &lt;/p&gt;

First he gave an overview of the Gutenberg 15.5 release and the showed how to create a custom external template for APIs for the create-block scaffolding tool.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latter was also a topic of a Gutenberg Times Live Q &amp;amp; A with &lt;strong&gt;Grzegorz Ziolkowski&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Fabian KÃ¤gy&lt;/strong&gt; a couple of years ago, with demos and additional background: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gutenbergtimes.com/tooling-using-create-block-scaffolding-and-3rd-party-templates/&quot;&gt;Tooling: Using Create-Block Scaffolding and 3rd Party Templates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Newly Rewritten WordPress SQLite Database Integration Plugin Needs Testing</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=143887</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/newly-rewritten-wordpress-sqlite-database-integration-plugin-needs-testing</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress contributors are making progress on officially &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/sqlite-database-integration-now-available-as-a-plugin-for-testing&quot;&gt;supporting SQLite in core&lt;/a&gt;, a project that would benefit less complex sites (small to medium sites and blogs) that donât necessarily require WordPressâ standard MySQL database. In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/04/19/status-update-on-the-sqlite-project/&quot;&gt;update&lt;/a&gt;, Yoast-sponsored core contributor Ari Stathopoulos said the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/sqlite-database-integration/&quot;&gt;SQLite Database Integration&lt;/a&gt; feature plugin has been rewritten, with the help of Automattic-sponsored core contributor Adam Zielinski, to be a more future-proof implementation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The code has been completely rewritten to use an SQL Lexer and is now stable and able to handle all WordPress queries properly,&amp;#8221; Stathopoulos said. &amp;#8220;The SQL Lexer is part of theÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/phpmyadmin/sql-parser&quot;&gt;PHPMyAdmin/SQL-Parser&lt;/a&gt;Â project (licensed under theÂ GPLÂ 2.0) and it was adapted for WordPress, effectively implementing aÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/sqlite-database-integration/pull/9&quot;&gt;MySQL to SQLite translation engine&lt;/a&gt;. This provides improved security, as well as compatibility.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stathopoulos contends that the next step is to implement these changes in WordPress core &amp;#8220;instead of using a plugin,&amp;#8221; because in its current form it can only be tested on pre-existing websites that already have a MySQL database.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Using theÂ &lt;em&gt;featured&lt;/em&gt;Â plugin is a great way to allow users to test the implementation and iron out any issues etc,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;However, long-term, it doesnât make sense to use it as a plugin.&amp;#8221;Â &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stathopoulos created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/3220&quot;&gt;draft Pull Request&lt;/a&gt;Â and an accompanyingÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57793&quot;&gt;Trac ticket&lt;/a&gt; proposing the new implementation be merged into core.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the effort has received positive feedback and support from the community and WordPress lead developer Matt Mullenweg, the feature plugin has only 30 active installs and the new implementation has received very little testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Multiple participants in the discussion, including core committer Aaron Jorbin and lead developer Andrew Ozz, expressed concerns about the proposal&amp;#8217;s call for merging the changes to core as the next step. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Talk of merging toÂ coreÂ feels incredibly premature for a couple of reasons,&amp;#8221; Jorbin said. &amp;#8220;TheÂ pluginÂ now only has around 30 installations. I think there needs to be much higher adoption in order to understand how the near-infinite number of plugins will work with this deep underlying change to WordPress.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jorbin also referenced WordPress&amp;#8217; philosophy of building things for end users who don&amp;#8217;t want to have to make decisions about the underlying tech but simply want things to work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Assuming that a user is going to understand different database engines and the potential tradeoffs feels far stretched to me,&amp;#8221; Jorbin said. &amp;#8220;Therefore, any implementation really needs to be rock solid and extremely thoroughly tested.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jorbin also echoed concerns of other contributors in previous conversations, about &lt;a href=&quot;https://sqlite.org/codeofethics.html&quot;&gt;SQLite&amp;#8217;s bizarre religion-infused &amp;#8220;code of ethics&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ozz suggested the plugin could be added to WordPress as a mu-plugin or a &amp;#8220;drop-in&amp;#8221; similar to how caching add-ons are implemented, pushing back on the rigidity of the requirement to fully merge it into core.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Both of these methods are also better/more suitable for the users as they can be done by the hosting company or the script used for WordPress installation,&amp;#8221; Ozz said. &amp;#8220;There are some other benefits like independent updates, etc.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stathopoulos responded to these concerns, saying that he sees the merge to core as a long-term goal, although the proposal communicated more of an urgency that confused participants in the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It is premature,&amp;#8221; Stathopoulos admitted. &amp;#8220;However, looking at the bigger picture, it is not premature to plan for the future and get ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It may be premature now, but it wonât be 2 years from nowâ¦ The problem is that we wonât be able to do it in the future unless we start working on it now.&lt;br /&gt;SQLite is not something that can â or should â happen in Core now, or even a year from now. Itâs a long-term goal, and should be treated as such.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stathopoulos agreed that the plugin needs more adoption to see how it works with plugins across the ecosystem. He also responded to concerns about users not fully understanding the implications of the database engine they select on installation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The proof-of-conceptÂ UIÂ I put in place in the Core PR is just that â a proof of concept,&amp;#8221;  Stathopoulos said. &amp;#8220;Something to trigger discussion and allow us to find solutions. It can be anything, even installation scenarios (do you want to create aÂ blog? A small e-commerce site? A large news outlet? The next Amazon?) That is a discussion that will need to happen when the time is right to discuss UI, but itâs is a bit too early for that, I donât think weâre there yet.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stathopoulos recommends contributors test the new implementation with all the plugins they normally use, via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://w.org/plugins/sqlite-database-integration/&quot;&gt;SQLite Database Integration plugin&lt;/a&gt; or by testing theÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/3220&quot;&gt;draft pull request in WordPress Core&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inaugural WordCamp Jinja 2022 attendees in the Computer Lab at Jinja College School on 2nd Sept 2022&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;At the heart of every revolution lies a spark that ignites the collective spirit, driving the wheels of change and inspiring the future. In the realm of WordPress, this spark is the passion for innovation, collaboration, and creativity. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jinja.wordcamp.org/2023/&quot;&gt;WordCamp Jinja 2023&lt;/a&gt; is proud to stand as a torchbearer in this journey, with a mission to empower the future generation of WordPress users: our students and their teachers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scheduled for the 4th and 5th of September, 2023, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://jinja.wordcamp.org/2023/location/&quot;&gt;Iganga Secondary School&lt;/a&gt; the prestigious girl&amp;#8217;s school in Eastern Uganda. WordCamp Jinja 2023 embraces the theme, &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;There is always more to learn!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; adapted from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;learn.wordpress.org platform&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;But WordCamp Jinja 2023 is not merely an exclusive domain for students and teachers. Oh no, dear friends! The invitation extends far and wide, reaching out to the local tech communities to partake in the festivities. We believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and WordPress is a great companion along the way. Whether you are a student, a teacher, a developer, a designer, a blogger, or an entrepreneur, there is always something new to discover and share with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The event will feature hands-on and minds-on workshops that encourage participants to explore the depths of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;Learn WordPress platform&lt;/a&gt;, while also offering an Entrepreneurship Track with breakout speaker presentations. The extra Contributor Day, scheduled for the 6th of September at &lt;a href=&quot;https://jinja.wordcamp.org/2023/location/&quot;&gt;The Innovation Village in Jinja&lt;/a&gt;, will feature a Website Hackathon to further engage and inspire the attendees as their skills are put to the test to create stunning websites with WordPress in a limited time, working in teams and competing for prizes and glory!.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We believe that by fostering a spirit of learning and collaboration, we can help shape the minds of the future, ensuring a legacy of innovation and progress. To achieve this, we are extending a warm invitation to speakers / trainers. If you have a story to tell, knowledge to share, or inspiration to spread, please submit your proposal through our Call for Speakers page: &lt;a href=&quot;https://jinja.wordcamp.org/2023/call-for-speakers/&quot;&gt;https://jinja.wordcamp.org/2023/call-for-speakers/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Gutenberg 15.6 Introduces Experimental Details Block and Command Center for Site Editor</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=143837</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-15-6-introduces-experimental-details-block-and-command-center-for-site-editor</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/04/19/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15-6-19-april/&quot;&gt;Gutenberg 15.6&lt;/a&gt; is now available with a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/45055&quot;&gt;Details block&lt;/a&gt; tucked under the Experiments menu. Once enabled, it can be used to toggle the visibility of hidden content. This can be useful for presenting things like text transcripts for video blocks or simple spoiler alerts. By default the toggle is open in the block editor but closed on the front end. This is the first iteration, so the behavior of the toggle is still somewhat rough.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Another interesting experiment that shipped in version 15.6 is a command center for the Site Editor. It was created to be a quick search for jumping to other pages or templates in the editor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This can be seen as a start on an extensible command and quick search component that can be used for way-finding (&lt;em&gt;go to About page&lt;/em&gt;;Â &lt;em&gt;edit Archive template&lt;/em&gt;) and running commands (&lt;em&gt;toggle top toolbar&lt;/em&gt;; etc),&amp;#8221; Gutenberg lead architect Matias Ventura said in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/48457&quot;&gt;ticket&lt;/a&gt; outlining the feature. &amp;#8220;The first milestone is to power quick search for content and templates within the site editor.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella said his goal with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/49330&quot;&gt;initial PR&lt;/a&gt; is to build the APIs and components for the command center but not necessarily implement all the commands. Ultimately he aims for this feature to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The command center can be loaded in any WPAdmin page&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The commands and the command center are independent: Commands can be registered dynamically depending on the context&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Some small hierarchy of commands to be able to organize the items&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Allowing dynamic searches for commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg contributors are still considering how to organize and display commands better based on context, which is one reason why this feature remains behind the Experiments flag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Version 15.6 also brings spacing presets to the Spacer block settings, allowing theme authors to create sensible presets and users to adjust spacing in a way that will look good across devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Since the introduction of spacing presets, it became clear from community feedback thatÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44002&quot;&gt;spacing presets&lt;/a&gt;Â should also be available for the Height control in the Spacer block,&amp;#8221; WordPress developer advocate Birgit Pauli-Haack said in the release post. &amp;#8220;ThisÂ enhancementÂ in 15.6 gives theme developers much more flexibility over how spacing is applied throughout a site and enables fluid Spacer blocks.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WordPress core contributor Nick Diego filmed a short video about spacing presets for the Spacer block, which demonstrates how fluid spacing work to help a site&amp;#8217;s content and design adapt better to different viewports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-embed__wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Gutenberg 15.6 came out yesterday, and one of my favorite new features is spacing presets for the Spacer block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fluid spacers anyone? &lt;img src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2728.png&quot; alt=&quot;â¨&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/k9NJSy05Xd&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/k9NJSy05Xd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nick Diego (@nickmdiego) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nickmdiego/status/1649055649542856704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 20, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few other highlights in Gutenberg 15.6 include the following:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds border support to the Cover block&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Makes Style Variations accessible in Browse Mode&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;List View now allows dragging underneath collapsed non-empty container blocks&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Smoother animations for Drop Zone in the canvas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Takeaways:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep up with the latest WordPress updates.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s important for WordPress professionals to stay up-to-date with the latest WordPress updates, including security patches, bug fixes, and new features. This will ensure that your WordPress site stays secure and runs smoothly.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on user experience.&lt;/strong&gt; User experience should be at the forefront of any WordPress professional&amp;#8217;s mind.

By focusing on user experience, WordPress professionals can create websites that are both effective and enjoyable to use.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper&quot; id=&quot;h-transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;Session 10 Corey &amp;amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cory Miller: [00:00:00] Nice. Um, so it makes it really nice to stream YouTube. Um, okay, so&lt;br /&gt;session 10. Now turn off YouTube. Um, so session 10, we&amp;#8217;re talking, um, last week we said&lt;br /&gt;we&amp;#8217;re good on the version for Crop Dotted Express, and we had saw a new direction with the&lt;br /&gt;project you had been working on anyway. Mm-hmm. And we spent some time just privately&lt;br /&gt;discussing that.&lt;br /&gt;And so, um, we were just chatting in the pre-roll before this about okay is, you know, building it&lt;br /&gt;in public, but we&amp;#8217;re, we&amp;#8217;ve pa not paused, we&amp;#8217;ve put a bow on that one and said, okay, there&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;something else here. And now it&amp;#8217;s time to kind of explore that and figure out what&amp;#8217;s, what could&lt;br /&gt;that product be. [00:01:00] Um, you just had a couple really good, um, comments about that&lt;br /&gt;whole process of here&amp;#8217;s that one, but we&amp;#8217;re going onto this next one.&lt;br /&gt;Hmm. Can you share some of that you&amp;#8217;re just sharing with me? Cause I think it&amp;#8217;s really good&lt;br /&gt;and I don&amp;#8217;t want to Sure. Oh, your butcher, you&amp;#8217;re your top.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: Um, so, uh, for the sake of accountability, I do wanna say that Crop express, uh,&lt;br /&gt;is pending a read me update that you and I worked on, I think last time. And there are a couple&lt;br /&gt;of tweaks to make to the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;The plugin itself. To in fact put a bow on it cuz I wanted it. It&amp;#8217;s gonna be, you know, so, so a little&lt;br /&gt;digression here. It&amp;#8217;s very easy for, uh, any product team as we now are to go, uh, that was&lt;br /&gt;yesterday&amp;#8217;s new shiny, [00:02:00] today&amp;#8217;s new shinies over there. Um, and if we are not&lt;br /&gt;abandoning crop express, which we are not, then it&amp;#8217;s important that I sit down at some point and&lt;br /&gt;actually put a bow on it.&lt;br /&gt;And we don&amp;#8217;t just keep saying we&amp;#8217;re gonna put a bow on it and let it ride, but, um, you know, let&lt;br /&gt;it be a whole product unto itself. I think that&amp;#8217;s important. So that&amp;#8217;s on my list. Um, but yeah, we,&lt;br /&gt;in, in the process of talking about crop express and where the value add is, um, one of the&lt;br /&gt;things that you talked about really well, um, is the, Difference between, you had a little graphic&lt;br /&gt;that, you know, pain solving a pain versus adding value.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and obviously these things are not mutually exclusive by any stretch, but, um, crop Express&lt;br /&gt;solved a problem for us. That&amp;#8217;s why, why we started the conversation in the first place. I built this&lt;br /&gt;little web utility. You went, holy crap, this [00:03:00] needs to be in WordPress. Uh, and that&lt;br /&gt;launched our journey, but we kept having these great meta conversations about image images&lt;br /&gt;in WordPress as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;And one of the things, problems that I&amp;#8217;ve been struggling with for a while, for my own blog and&lt;br /&gt;again for, um, client sites, not only is it cropping images correctly, which solves a pain point,&lt;br /&gt;ideally, um, but is you write a blog post and, and then what? Right. You need other assets to go&lt;br /&gt;along with it. Uh, and then in a perfect, you know, so we&amp;#8217;re talking, now we&amp;#8217;re talking about&lt;br /&gt;marketing, right?&lt;br /&gt;We&amp;#8217;re talking about marketing assets, things to put on Twitter, images to put on Twitter images&lt;br /&gt;to put on Instagram, and, and having to go over to Canva to do that or some other tool. Um, and&lt;br /&gt;so now we&amp;#8217;re talking [00:04:00] about that, which is, you know, there is pain involved. These are&lt;br /&gt;extra steps, but it&amp;#8217;s the difference between, to me, you know, the difference between trying to&lt;br /&gt;write a, a basic blog post with an image inward press, and that it&amp;#8217;s.&lt;br /&gt;You get to the end of the words and you&amp;#8217;re like, oh, this is such a pain. I need to do something&lt;br /&gt;with an image and leave WordPress. Versus traditionally, I think we&amp;#8217;d write a blog post in&lt;br /&gt;WordPress and then go, okay, the WordPress part is done. Now let me jump over to Canva,&lt;br /&gt;Photoshop, whatever it is to generate these other images.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and so now we&amp;#8217;re sort of switching over to a value add potentially.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Yeah. I, um, most of my product experience is in the pain threshold. Um, you know,&lt;br /&gt;backup, security, all that, you know, updating stuff, very [00:05:00] utilitarian, um, practical&lt;br /&gt;things, and I really appreciate it. That&amp;#8217;s part of my personality too. I like utility things. You know,&lt;br /&gt;there&amp;#8217;s this pin, for instance, is the big. A pin.&lt;br /&gt;And in my belief, there&amp;#8217;s no other better pin than this pin. So I take &amp;#8217;em from everywhere that&lt;br /&gt;has &amp;#8217;em, that gives &amp;#8217;em out. And I promote all Napa Valley Winery. Um, so I, I&amp;#8217;m practical in that&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;utilitarian, like, do something for you. And it was great to see some of the products, like people&lt;br /&gt;just, they needed it, you know?&lt;br /&gt;Um, I always aspired to the ones that help people look good, make money, all that. And we built&lt;br /&gt;those into those products for sure, where people could use those things and what labeled them&lt;br /&gt;or package them into a bigger thing. And so a lot of the products were very utility products, but&lt;br /&gt;the marketing and things we did was very aspirational.&lt;br /&gt;Um, [00:06:00] this one so interesting because you had already been working on something and&lt;br /&gt;you showed it to me and I was like, oh, wow. And. As I can do anything, I can blow something&lt;br /&gt;real big up, you know? And that&amp;#8217;s what we did. We, wow. The compelling thing was, you know,&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll take some of the marketing tools, like for instance, uh, the one I just kind of default to think of&lt;br /&gt;is Optum Monster.&lt;br /&gt;Hmm. When you see what, whatever time they came out with the Optum Monster, um, when&lt;br /&gt;you see that a popup and what they, what you could do with that, you instantly kind of go, oh&lt;br /&gt;wow, I could do that too. And that&amp;#8217;s, that&amp;#8217;s really compelling for me. Um mm-hmm. When you&amp;#8217;re&lt;br /&gt;able to show an outcome that people go, I mean, it&amp;#8217;s marketing product for sure.&lt;br /&gt;It helps you build your email, um, email list. It helps you potentially, [00:07:00] uh, get some&lt;br /&gt;purchases from coupons and things like that. Not to go into the full thing about Optum Monster,&lt;br /&gt;but. You go right there, you can see what the product does. Mm-hmm. And if you don&amp;#8217;t have&lt;br /&gt;that, you can go, wow, this could make, make it easier.&lt;br /&gt;What&amp;#8217;s compelling about what you said was, or what we, we, you showed me is this, one of the&lt;br /&gt;many things we talked about was the social images, being able to, you write your post and then&lt;br /&gt;you&amp;#8217;re, you&amp;#8217;re ready to promote it and like you said, go to Cam and do all these things. Um, I&lt;br /&gt;think in this conversation, what I&amp;#8217;ve kinda learned from Crop Drive Express and then past stuff is&lt;br /&gt;particularly with this idea, we can give that aha oh wow moment for someone.&lt;br /&gt;And we talked about using it on some of our client sites, post status and different things. Um,&lt;br /&gt;because then when you see. That&amp;#8217;s where I [00:08:00] think, you know, when they see&lt;br /&gt;something going out that has a nice treatment, um, yeah. Where it&amp;#8217;s not just a link. I mean,&lt;br /&gt;that&amp;#8217;s what I tend to do personally. Um, then I think there&amp;#8217;s, there&amp;#8217;s some merit there of you want&lt;br /&gt;your base hub to be your website and they&amp;#8217;re promoting outs through your social channels, and&lt;br /&gt;then those to look appealing and good, whether it&amp;#8217;s Facebook, Instagram, whatever those things&lt;br /&gt;are.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. Um, and kinda lead back. And that&amp;#8217;s where I go. I&amp;#8217;ll tell you, I in this, in this whole project&lt;br /&gt;that we&amp;#8217;ve been working on together, it just keep, I keep coming back to you and I talked about&lt;br /&gt;our, at our product owners meet up this week. Um, getting as close as you can to the pain that a&lt;br /&gt;potential customer has, um, or that desire to do for them to look better, make more money.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, I don&amp;#8217;t know. This is the work I need to do more is getting closer to that, you know? Mm-&lt;br /&gt;hmm. Where it&amp;#8217;s not just theory, us talking, it&amp;#8217;s like, [00:09:00] you know, do, is this an issue?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;#8217;s, um, you know, a book out called the Mom Test and mm-hmm. The thing is, when&lt;br /&gt;you have an idea and you go to your mom, she&amp;#8217;s always gonna say, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. So making it in a way where it&amp;#8217;s more discovery. But that&amp;#8217;s my thoughts about this and I&lt;br /&gt;wanna be sure because this is a bigger project. Um, I guess the word would be validating. Yep.&lt;br /&gt;Is there a pain point? Is there someone willing to, to, to pay for it? Um, so we&amp;#8217;re really taking it. I&lt;br /&gt;know we approached this as a hobby, but going, okay, give our best effort to make this into&lt;br /&gt;something that actually does pay us my thought.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: Yeah. . And that was, and that was, I think, part of why, so I don&amp;#8217;t remember the&lt;br /&gt;summary to, to, we&amp;#8217;re on session 10. So in session eight, I think we, we, the conversation came&lt;br /&gt;to a point where we said, okay, so, so [00:10:00] cropping images is one piece of the puzzle of&lt;br /&gt;consistent, good looking images on a WordPress site.&lt;br /&gt;That could be a blog, that could be WooCommerce, whatever, right? Um, and so we were still&lt;br /&gt;sort of solving, um, yeah, we were solving a basic problem. Um, again, a p a a point of pain that,&lt;br /&gt;uh, we had. Um, I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m trying, in my brain, I keep drawing this analogy of, um, a basic car, your&lt;br /&gt;Honda Civic from, I, my first Honda Civic, uh, that I bought in 2015 was from 2000.&lt;br /&gt;So 15 year old, you know, but in good shape. But it would get you there, but no bells and&lt;br /&gt;whistles. The, the crank windows, the whole thing, right? And so, um, and, and a lot of people, I&lt;br /&gt;think this was a, you know, more traditionally [00:11:00] WordPress as a blog platform was that&lt;br /&gt;for a lot of people, I&amp;#8217;m gonna put words out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maybe people find it or they don&amp;#8217;t. I&amp;#8217;m gonna tell my friends about it along come social media,&lt;br /&gt;uh, and, and other paradigms and, and the things go from, I guess you sort of hope for inbound,&lt;br /&gt;you know, and we&amp;#8217;re talking about amateurs or, or non-professionals is the better word, right?&lt;br /&gt;But, um, you know, to outbound.&lt;br /&gt;And then also I think there&amp;#8217;s an expectation now, or most people blog for money, right? Most&lt;br /&gt;people publish for money. Most people use WordPress for money a lot more than back in the&lt;br /&gt;day when it was, you know, express yourself or put yourself online or, or, you know, build&lt;br /&gt;authority, all those things. Um, and so taking that, uh, your, the, the bigger problem that we,&lt;br /&gt;when we talked about with crop express of consistent [00:12:00] images and putting yourself out&lt;br /&gt;there, and it&amp;#8217;s like we&amp;#8217;re talking about, um, Individuality, right?&lt;br /&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s not just cropping finding a, finding a, a stock photo one for each post, right? Or each, um,&lt;br /&gt;product image. If you&amp;#8217;ve, if you&amp;#8217;re running Woo commerce, it&amp;#8217;s like, yeah, it&amp;#8217;s a square. Okay, it&amp;#8217;s,&lt;br /&gt;I sell, you know, this widget and that widget, and I crop them all to be squares. But it&amp;#8217;s like, do&lt;br /&gt;those images stand out?&lt;br /&gt;Do those images have more information? So it&amp;#8217;s like, if I go to the website, there&amp;#8217;s all the&lt;br /&gt;information next to a photo. But on Twitter, if I put that photo up and it&amp;#8217;s just a picture of a&lt;br /&gt;widget, it doesn&amp;#8217;t list the benefits. It doesn&amp;#8217;t, you know, so it&amp;#8217;s not, um, a compelling bigger, and&lt;br /&gt;this is where, you know, um, I think one of the things that really clicked for me was you sent me.&lt;br /&gt;The, on the, on the post status blog, one of the threads there is, or tags or something is, you&lt;br /&gt;know, here are all the [00:13:00] people we&amp;#8217;ve featured. And I was like, wait, all of these banner&lt;br /&gt;images not only are the same size, but they&amp;#8217;ve all got the same treatment. They all have the&lt;br /&gt;post status logo on the left. Um, you know, and we look at, and that, and that, that solidified&lt;br /&gt;something for me that you&amp;#8217;d touched on, but I, I couldn&amp;#8217;t relate to as much.&lt;br /&gt;Like, you, you really liked slides, um, and talked about using slides again to promote things.&lt;br /&gt;And, and we sort of went, wow, what if, you know, you have, um, uh, your product images, you&lt;br /&gt;or your, your, your blog post banner, image featured image, um, that had bullet points on it or,&lt;br /&gt;you know, so it was like taking these, I guess what I&amp;#8217;m trying to do is summarize, um, very&lt;br /&gt;specifically, A little bit of how we got here, but also what we&amp;#8217;re now talking about, right?&lt;br /&gt;So we&amp;#8217;re talking about image treatment, image generation, um, based around one post quote&lt;br /&gt;unquote [00:14:00] post, which in WordPress can be a product, can be a blog post, can be an&lt;br /&gt;article, can be your course if you&amp;#8217;re running an l m s, whatever it is. Um, and so that&amp;#8217;s kind of&lt;br /&gt;the, the switch from solving a pain point, cropping an image to this huge value add.&lt;br /&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s like, and I guess, yeah, uh, it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s coming together in my head. You brought in opt,&lt;br /&gt;brought up Optum Monster. So it&amp;#8217;s like you could have a website, you could have great content.&lt;br /&gt;Optin Monster is this value add. If your end goal is promotion, money, fame, and fortune, all that&lt;br /&gt;kind of stuff, being a reality TV star, um, optin Monster is this great.&lt;br /&gt;You know, the going from, from your Honda Civic to the, the sport version, and then the fins and&lt;br /&gt;the, you know, so now suddenly you&amp;#8217;ve got, you know, you&amp;#8217;ve gone from a basic way to publish&lt;br /&gt;content to, you know, bells and [00:15:00] whistles essentially. Um, which isn&amp;#8217;t to diminish it like&lt;br /&gt;bells and whistles are often it&amp;#8217;s, um, not it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s said in a condescending way or a bad way, but&lt;br /&gt;we&amp;#8217;re talking about like, okay, how can you, you know, make the, the basic car that gets you&lt;br /&gt;from A to B be a fun experience, that kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;Um, enough restraining the metaphors. The point is, um, yeah, OptinMonster adds this extra&lt;br /&gt;value and whatnot. So it&amp;#8217;s like if we have, uh, if you write a blog post, what we&amp;#8217;re talking about&lt;br /&gt;doing is, is. A product in WordPress that can generate slides, can generate images, could crop&lt;br /&gt;the image, but also could add potentially a, a graphical treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Um, so it&amp;#8217;s always got a blue fade or it&amp;#8217;s always got a logo on the left, or it&amp;#8217;s always got, and, and&lt;br /&gt;these things would be auto-generated. Um, so you, you finish your post, you click a button and&lt;br /&gt;[00:16:00] you&amp;#8217;ve got an image for Twitter, an image for Facebook, an image that you know, I&lt;br /&gt;mean, taking this to a, um, an extreme no idea if we can yet, if we can do this, but, um, anim an&lt;br /&gt;creating an animated gift that has three slides that go by or, you know, things, so things you&lt;br /&gt;could upload to Instagram.&lt;br /&gt;You know, if it&amp;#8217;s an animated gif it should be, we could create an MP4 out of it and then it&amp;#8217;s, um,&lt;br /&gt;a story for Instagram cuz it&amp;#8217;s a video and da da da. So all these, all these shareable assets,&lt;br /&gt;which again, take that basic blog post and just blow it up to, to create all these amazing things&lt;br /&gt;that you could then do something with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, when we came to, when we were starting to talk about that as a product in our previous call&lt;br /&gt;or previous previous call, that was when I said, okay, let&amp;#8217;s have a conversation offline cuz I think&lt;br /&gt;maybe I&amp;#8217;ve got a solution for this. Um, so in [00:17:00] parallel, for a few months now, um, I built.&lt;br /&gt;Little SAS app, basically web service, um, called screenshot.express and haven&amp;#8217;t launched it.&lt;br /&gt;That was if, if you follow me on Twitter, or I think I might have mentioned here too, like this is a&lt;br /&gt;product that I built, um, and the a p I works, it works as a, is a little screenshotting platform. Um,&lt;br /&gt;but what I really wanted it for was, yes, it&amp;#8217;s great for taking a screenshot of a website, but if it&lt;br /&gt;can take a picture of, of, of a website.&lt;br /&gt;But that website could be the size and shape of a Twitter banner or, you know, could be a, um, a&lt;br /&gt;slide. Then we&amp;#8217;re now talking about using H T M L to, to define a layout. Whatever we want that&lt;br /&gt;to look like. And then taking pictures of it. And then there you&amp;#8217;ve got your image and so, and CR&lt;br /&gt;and [00:18:00] generating different types of H T M L pages and also taking advantage of res, the&lt;br /&gt;responsiveness of, of layout.&lt;br /&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s like if you have a header and some text next to each other, but on mobile, the he, the&lt;br /&gt;header goes above the text with one H T M L output. You take two pictures, one wide and one&lt;br /&gt;narrow. You&amp;#8217;ve now got a, uh, a Twitter banner and you know, a mobile screenshot or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s like, I realized that in parallel, I&amp;#8217;ve already got this little service that will potentially solve&lt;br /&gt;the technical aspect of this.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and so that was where sort of all this came together and we went, wow, that&amp;#8217;s, that to me is&lt;br /&gt;a much bigger thing. Um, and so as you said at the, the beginning of my ramble, like, we see&lt;br /&gt;this as a, as a much bigger product to me, right away my gut says, okay, that&amp;#8217;s much more of a,&lt;br /&gt;something we could sell. You know, it&amp;#8217;s, [00:19:00] it&amp;#8217;s a big packageable thing.&lt;br /&gt;Whereas crop Express, it was like, this is a great little utility. It solves a neat little problem. And&lt;br /&gt;we could probably keep adding some things or, or splashing around in the problem until we&lt;br /&gt;found something that would, people pay, would pay a little bit for. Um, but this to me seems like&lt;br /&gt;something much bigger.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Yeah, for sure. And I don&amp;#8217;t, um, my tendency is always like, oh, let&amp;#8217;s go, let&amp;#8217;s go.&lt;br /&gt;And I&amp;#8217;m trying to really not do that because I, I wanna be careful, you, you in particular. Me too.&lt;br /&gt;But you, um, as a developer on the partner, um, and lead on this, I, I wanna be really careful&lt;br /&gt;with the time. Mm-hmm. Um, because I, I think we both go, we did something of value here, and&lt;br /&gt;I wanna be a little bit more calculated than I have in the past about Okay.&lt;br /&gt;Because I can blow these ideas up and go, okay, I see these, what I don&amp;#8217;t wanna do is just do&lt;br /&gt;that in a [00:20:00] vacuum. Um, not to like you and I are doing this, but I, I want to, I feel like&lt;br /&gt;there&amp;#8217;s something so powerful of getting to whatever the person is trying to do, like having&lt;br /&gt;somebody in mind, or talking to people and seeing what they.&lt;br /&gt;Talk about it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s funny. So with product at post status, I go, just to give you kind of a parallel&lt;br /&gt;about how I&amp;#8217;ve historically think about product and need to change and, and evolve, is I go,&lt;br /&gt;okay, for our agency, we, we saw real quickly becoming an owner post status that, um, okay,&lt;br /&gt;product people, smaller group of people than you got hosting companies, you have&lt;br /&gt;professionals that do all the work.&lt;br /&gt;But I really honed in on, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of WordPress agencies out there, and I don&amp;#8217;t see in this&lt;br /&gt;space a lot of people that there are really cool companies doing really high-end work for&lt;br /&gt;agencies like [00:21:00] Troy, Dean&amp;#8217;s work, um, uro, different things like that. But I go, okay, I,&lt;br /&gt;for me, Passion and ability and go.&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#8217;d love to promote and help people tell stories and draw expertise. So long story short, besides&lt;br /&gt;just Slack and e and our email newsletter, I think we can offer more to them. Where I&amp;#8217;m at in that&lt;br /&gt;product is really interesting for me. Frustrating. I shouldn&amp;#8217;t say interesting. I don&amp;#8217;t wanna say&lt;br /&gt;interesting.&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#8217;s frustrating as hell is I go, we could do mar co-marketing for these agencies. Now you know&lt;br /&gt;how it is, you bring in an idea to somebody else. It&amp;#8217;s so different from the my uh, the, my big Fat&lt;br /&gt;Greek wedding when he goes, you have to make it his idea. And I go, oh, that&amp;#8217;s so true with me&lt;br /&gt;too. But, but I go, if you get to customer and see what they&amp;#8217;re doing, um, potential customer and&lt;br /&gt;just talk.&lt;br /&gt;So like in my interviews with the agency owners, one of the things they stand up, but I&lt;br /&gt;[00:22:00] think there&amp;#8217;s a bias cause I&amp;#8217;m coming at as post status. Um, and one of the features&lt;br /&gt;we&amp;#8217;ve had in our products is job listings. I go. That&amp;#8217;s what they tend to have gravitated toward it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I go, well, I don&amp;#8217;t know what more else we could potentially offer in that, but keep getting&lt;br /&gt;pros in there.&lt;br /&gt;And so that&amp;#8217;s like existing product, just trying to make it better, which is valid foundational. I&lt;br /&gt;wanted to do more for them. Now this is where we&amp;#8217;re in that process and, but I don&amp;#8217;t want it to&lt;br /&gt;be like, I got this cool idea. Cuz then you&amp;#8217;re kind of just striking trying to try to hit a hit, a hit a&lt;br /&gt;winning lado.&lt;br /&gt;Um, but that&amp;#8217;s where I&amp;#8217;m at, you know? And, um, with this my mind went to, oh, I mean we, we&lt;br /&gt;were talking about our own problems right now, and then we&amp;#8217;re using some clients and different&lt;br /&gt;things to think about that. But before we go, I wanna make sure [00:23:00] specifically first and&lt;br /&gt;foremost on your behalf is we. Gets some validation.&lt;br /&gt;A little spark of something. Yeah. And collect enough sparks that go, this could be a fire. Right?&lt;br /&gt;This could be, I just, I wanna do that cuz my tendency is I&amp;#8217;m an DF fair and you know, I dr at the&lt;br /&gt;opportunity to work with a great developer like yourself and, and product person like yourself.&lt;br /&gt;And, uh, so anyway, that&amp;#8217;s where my mind tends to go.&lt;br /&gt;But this is interesting to both of us. Um, now it&amp;#8217;s like if you got a hammer, everything looks like,&lt;br /&gt;like a nail. Uh, I wanna be careful of that in this.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: Yeah, sure. And I tend to build first and ask questions later. We know this, so,&lt;br /&gt;which is&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: freaking cool. I think that&amp;#8217;s better. See, it would be better as an idea person to be&lt;br /&gt;able to build it first too.&lt;br /&gt;Right. And say, but I just, I wanna be careful cause I don&amp;#8217;t have those skillsets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Corey Maass: Well, and, and this one is, I think one of the other things I mentioned in the pre-&lt;br /&gt;roll is [00:24:00] this is a much bigger lift. Yeah. And so I&amp;#8217;m also, my brain is saying there&amp;#8217;s, there&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;are red flags here to that approach. Crop express, small, you know, crank something out, get it,&lt;br /&gt;you know, we, the prototype is going to be straightforward, uh, or was straightforward and, and&lt;br /&gt;you coming in and going start with featured images.&lt;br /&gt;Great. Even simpler. So we&amp;#8217;ve got one and it turned out to be replicable. So then media library,&lt;br /&gt;um, block, um, we did have to hire somebody to get us over a couple of hurdles, but for the&lt;br /&gt;most part, Replicable, um, reusable code and all at once. Whereas this, I mean, so I already&lt;br /&gt;started my intention of spinning up screenshot express, which is abstract.&lt;br /&gt;And I knew that. I&amp;#8217;m like, this is probably isn&amp;#8217;t a thing. I&amp;#8217;m gonna, [00:25:00] I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m gonna sell&lt;br /&gt;on its own. There are, and there are people who are making progress with, with other products&lt;br /&gt;that take screenshots. And I admire that because I&amp;#8217;m like, this is a, this is a service. This is a,&lt;br /&gt;this a hundred percent a solution looking for a problem.&lt;br /&gt;And so it&amp;#8217;ll be other developers or me as a developer that uses this tool for whatever problem.&lt;br /&gt;And so it&amp;#8217;s like the, I said about building a, a WordPress plugin, which I think you and I should&lt;br /&gt;review and start pulling apart and see what we can do with, um, But it&amp;#8217;s, uh, to generate social&lt;br /&gt;images to accompany a post.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and so the good news is, yeah, I&amp;#8217;ve, I&amp;#8217;ve solved some of the, like, some of the problems,&lt;br /&gt;like, what do I wanna say, as a product, it&amp;#8217;s more complicated and involving a third party service,&lt;br /&gt;like screenshot.express is more complicated. And [00:26:00] then setting up different images for&lt;br /&gt;different use cases is complicated.&lt;br /&gt;And, uh, and solving the right problems is complicated. It&amp;#8217;s like you go to Canva, they&amp;#8217;ve got like,&lt;br /&gt;not only do they have all the assets and stuff, but they&amp;#8217;ve got a gajillion templates. What do you&lt;br /&gt;wanna make today? I wanna make an Instagram post. I wanna make a, you know, a music&lt;br /&gt;video. I wanna make a dot, dot dot.&lt;br /&gt;Like all these things. So somebody had to sit down and, and make templates out of all those&lt;br /&gt;things. Um, and so it&amp;#8217;s building, this is going, you know, as already. Even though I&amp;#8217;ve solved&lt;br /&gt;some of the problems connecting to the p i of Screenshot express and stuff is like, all of that is&lt;br /&gt;more complicated, a much more complicated user experience.&lt;br /&gt;Um, before we even get to the fun part of like, okay, now we can just build a gajillion templates&lt;br /&gt;and hope that one of them is the right thing and, and, and on and on. So, um, so yeah, it, it&lt;br /&gt;strikes me that you doing more interviews, re more research, [00:27:00] um, us getting more&lt;br /&gt;answers, um, before I, like, I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m inclined to, I keep waiting for you to say, like you saying,&lt;br /&gt;featured image early on was such a pivotal point, like, here&amp;#8217;s how we simplify this big,&lt;br /&gt;complicated thing to start with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, so no pressure, but I&amp;#8217;m waiting for you to come up with that again. Um, but I do think that&lt;br /&gt;since I&amp;#8217;ve got, since I&amp;#8217;m close to having s a, an initial. Social image generator plugin forward&lt;br /&gt;WordPress using Screenshot express that maybe we start there cuz it does solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;Um, enough for us to, for, for you to get eyes on it as far as user experience and go, yeah, no,&lt;br /&gt;this is, you&amp;#8217;ve made it as you, Corey have made it as simple as possible.&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#8217;s good enough. You know, we can, we can [00:28:00] tolerate people, people will tolerate&lt;br /&gt;stepping through this pro progress process, even though it&amp;#8217;s a handful of steps to get the value&lt;br /&gt;that we are creating at the end. Um, and then, and we keep having these conversations like we&lt;br /&gt;did with Crop Express, where we go, okay, wait, but if we put this over here, it makes more&lt;br /&gt;sense in context.&lt;br /&gt;Or if we mm-hmm. You know, connected to a different service or we put it in front of certain&lt;br /&gt;kinds of people, um, then. It&amp;#8217;ll take us, it&amp;#8217;ll take us to it. It&amp;#8217;ll help us grow.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Yeah. Uh, I just asked ChatGPT what are the most popular features of Canva?&lt;br /&gt;Hmm. So that, that&amp;#8217;s interesting. Um, excuse me, because we&amp;#8217;ve mentioned that a number of&lt;br /&gt;times and different photo editing tool.&lt;br /&gt;Um, I think so two parts, making sure I really understand what Screenshotted Express can do at&lt;br /&gt;the moment. Um, [00:29:00] but two, I think in this next experiment is having, having a default&lt;br /&gt;customer in mind. Yeah. And, you know, sizing that market, the, the person that we know, that&lt;br /&gt;we think we understand or have some connections with.&lt;br /&gt;And then seeing how that market is. Because it cur, it occurs to me like I told you with backup&lt;br /&gt;buddy. I go, well, that&amp;#8217;s a hundred percent. Theoretically, theoretically, everyone should want a,&lt;br /&gt;a backup for their WordPress site, right? Um, that was easy, right? Because the, you know,&lt;br /&gt;we&amp;#8217;re gonna go into this field and we&amp;#8217;re gonna hit something.&lt;br /&gt;Um,&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: But to, but I think to your point, like your average non nerd or non-professional&lt;br /&gt;doesn&amp;#8217;t think about that. You know, there&amp;#8217;s a reason why they are automatically that most&lt;br /&gt;hosting companies [00:30:00] offer automatic backups. And even if they don&amp;#8217;t, I almost can&lt;br /&gt;guarantee that they&amp;#8217;re doing at least some periodic, because the majority of their support tickets&lt;br /&gt;are, I broke my site, or somebody hacked my site.&lt;br /&gt;What? And I, you know, and, and support. A technician comes back and says, great, what&lt;br /&gt;about, what do you have for backups? And the person goes, what&amp;#8217;s a backup? And then they&lt;br /&gt;go, oh, well you are lucky on our server in a very hidden technical way. I can at least restore it&lt;br /&gt;from seven days ago or from yesterday or what have you.&lt;br /&gt;You know, but you should have thought about this and then mm-hmm. You know, but, but your&lt;br /&gt;average person doesn&amp;#8217;t think about backups. Right. Um, so you still, you were solving a problem&lt;br /&gt;that everybody has, but most people don&amp;#8217;t know they have. Mm-hmm.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Yeah. And, and where when we get the main product out, we&amp;#8217;re able to do&lt;br /&gt;[00:31:00] content marketing around all the reasons why it would be good.&lt;br /&gt;We even created a content, um, content replacement calendar or something. We tried to say,&lt;br /&gt;what&amp;#8217;s the value of all your posts? Because I lost, uh, I lost things from my personal website&lt;br /&gt;when we had a server crash. Now, you know, there they weren&amp;#8217;t invaluable, but it was, it was a&lt;br /&gt;headache. So we started doing that to try to map that out.&lt;br /&gt;But, um, when we talk about avatars for a second, um, we have your clients content journey,&lt;br /&gt;and then the, what I hear over, and it&amp;#8217;s so interesting, my, my own perception of WordPress has&lt;br /&gt;changed so much. Um, but what I hear over and over from our agencies and owners and things&lt;br /&gt;is that the people running when they deliver projects, I, it&amp;#8217;s really compelling that it&amp;#8217;s marketing&lt;br /&gt;[00:32:00] specific people.&lt;br /&gt;Mm-hmm. I just got outta the, a agency owners meetup and it was again, like they&amp;#8217;re turning&lt;br /&gt;sites over and typically it&amp;#8217;s marketing related type. People are actually the people using their&lt;br /&gt;WordPress sites from enterprise. WordPress does really good in the enterprise because&lt;br /&gt;marketers go, it&amp;#8217;s cheaper, it&amp;#8217;s faster, and I can use it.&lt;br /&gt;So I, I would say like in this backup buddy thought, I go big market, I am a marketer. I go that,&lt;br /&gt;that&amp;#8217;s really compelling. Which is why when we talked about screenshotted express, I was like&lt;br /&gt;the social images. I, but I don&amp;#8217;t, I gotta admit, make sure I&amp;#8217;m honest about this. I don&amp;#8217;t do that. I&lt;br /&gt;don&amp;#8217;t really post to our website.&lt;br /&gt;Um, we have team and content journey and different things that do that. But if we take that a,&lt;br /&gt;that&amp;#8217;s one big avatar. I can like say, generally speaking, [00:33:00] if we hit the marketing room&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and that&amp;#8217;s the, the sexy make you look better, make money kind of realm. Yeah. So there&amp;#8217;s one,&lt;br /&gt;um, I think about yours as a lot of publishers, um, uh, publishers.&lt;br /&gt;But even like a lot of the content journey, you know, clients, um, it&amp;#8217;s, it kind of boils down to the&lt;br /&gt;marketing people. They&amp;#8217;re the ones interfacing with those clients. Yeah. Very.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: Yep. Um, yeah, we&amp;#8217;ve got, I&amp;#8217;ve got a couple of different scenarios. One is on one&lt;br /&gt;team, we have a person dedicated to social media. Um, and I am, so, so there&amp;#8217;s an interview I&lt;br /&gt;want to have, um, customer interview, like talk to them about how they&amp;#8217;re making stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I think they&amp;#8217;re using Canva. Um, and I think that they&amp;#8217;ve got template set up so that, again, it&amp;#8217;s,&lt;br /&gt;they plug in a featured [00:34:00] image, they plug in a featured image, but it&amp;#8217;s got the same&lt;br /&gt;treatment every time. Um, I want to make sure of. And I&amp;#8217;d love, we&amp;#8217;ll have you talk to them if, if&lt;br /&gt;you&amp;#8217;re following the, um, mom interview methodology.&lt;br /&gt;Um, cuz I&amp;#8217;d also, I think what would be really interesting would be, I have a history of taking, uh,&lt;br /&gt;blue ocean products and, and rebuilding them, repurposing them for WordPress. Um,&lt;br /&gt;sometimes with legit value and sometimes just because it&amp;#8217;s a smaller market, so it&amp;#8217;s easier to&lt;br /&gt;focus. And, and I&amp;#8217;m still fascinated with the idea of WordPress being the control panel for a, a&lt;br /&gt;person&amp;#8217;s entire business.&lt;br /&gt;Um, but I also would be curious if, you know, sorry. Um, if the people are who, if they are&lt;br /&gt;jumping into Canva, are they struggling? Like, is it too many choices? [00:35:00] Is it, um,&lt;br /&gt;repeatable? Uh, sorry, I gotta let a dog in. Hold on.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Go, go for it. I, I&amp;#8217;m opening up a y board to take some notes.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: And thankfully my spouse stepped in and cornered him. Um, but yeah, it&amp;#8217;s, you&lt;br /&gt;know, so is, is there value in generating these things from WordPress with the expectation that,&lt;br /&gt;like I just wrote, wrote a blog post, and as we talked about before, you know, there&amp;#8217;s the, the last&lt;br /&gt;10% or the, you know, maybe it&amp;#8217;s, let&amp;#8217;s use 80 20, right?&lt;br /&gt;Like 80% of what should be the process is writing a blog post. But at least in our experience,&lt;br /&gt;80% of the pain is. Um, the technically speaking anyway is going and finding an image,&lt;br /&gt;cropping [00:36:00] an image, all that kind of stuff, which is what we were trying to solve with&lt;br /&gt;Crop Express. And so, um, you know, is it, is it parallel here where it&amp;#8217;s like, okay, I&amp;#8217;ve written a&lt;br /&gt;blog post now what?&lt;br /&gt;And I think that that&amp;#8217;s a big problem, uh, to solve. Uh, or it&amp;#8217;s a, a question that, that we wanna be&lt;br /&gt;careful. We want to do a good job of defining the question to then come up with the solution.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and so it&amp;#8217;s, you know, our people. If, if, if we can get to the point where you&amp;#8217;ve generated a&lt;br /&gt;blog post, click a button, and then you&amp;#8217;ve got assets, that&amp;#8217;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Um, is that enough? How hard or difficult is it to create those assets? Because it&amp;#8217;s like Canva&lt;br /&gt;offers creativity. Right. You can do anything all the time forever. But I, for me, um, like I have a&lt;br /&gt;music blog, and so every time I, [00:37:00] or one of my writers writes a review, I go into Canva&lt;br /&gt;and I open exa, I open the same design, I say duplicate page.&lt;br /&gt;I change the title. I change the, so that it has the same treatment, right? Like, I&amp;#8217;m not doing what&lt;br /&gt;Canva kind of seems to want you to do, which is starting from scratch every single time.&lt;br /&gt;Because I&amp;#8217;m not, I&amp;#8217;m not doing that. I&amp;#8217;m not trying to be that creative, and in fact, that takes way&lt;br /&gt;more time rather than, You know, a quick, simple 32nd, copy, paste, change, title, publish.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and so I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m intrigued to find out if I&amp;#8217;m right about that. Um, mm-hmm. You know, if, if our&lt;br /&gt;team, if my teammate, somebody writes a story, publishes a story, like we have professional&lt;br /&gt;writers who are writing, um, you know, long form content, and then we&amp;#8217;ve got, again, a separate&lt;br /&gt;[00:38:00] person whose job it is in part to create social media content from that story to then&lt;br /&gt;publish everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and I&amp;#8217;d be interested to know if it&amp;#8217;s a simple process for them or, uh, the hypothesis similar&lt;br /&gt;to the crop express hypothesis is are they going, you know, the hard part should be. Putting all&lt;br /&gt;this stuff out there, looking at the analytics, like creating a, essentially a, a mini campaign, um, to&lt;br /&gt;promote this blog post.&lt;br /&gt;But most of the pain is actually going in and, and cropping an image and adding the treatment&lt;br /&gt;and all that kind of stuff. Um, and if, and if there&amp;#8217;s value in having that sit in WordPress&lt;br /&gt;alongside the blog post, um, you know, whether it&amp;#8217;s under media or whether it&amp;#8217;s going into the&lt;br /&gt;post and then seeing a little icon that opens up an app or, you know, whatever approach it is,&lt;br /&gt;um, you know, to make sure that there&amp;#8217;s as much benefit there as we&amp;#8217;re [00:39:00] hoping.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Okay. I&amp;#8217;m trying to make sure I take all these,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;um, okay. So, um, potential avatars, I think we&amp;#8217;ve said marketing. I try to put a little bit. Thing&lt;br /&gt;here. We got publishers I added in here. Um, because one thing that kind of, if you, if I just&lt;br /&gt;camp out in this marketing realm, um, I thought about screenshot express, and I go ebook&lt;br /&gt;creation or lead magnet creation.&lt;br /&gt;Mm-hmm. Like the covers. Mm-hmm. Um, you know, some kind of cover. Now I think that would&lt;br /&gt;also lend to this featured image creation in the sense of those graphics you talked about with&lt;br /&gt;post status. Like we got the featured image graphic that we kind of pulled together, but it just&lt;br /&gt;kind of made me [00:40:00] think like outputs, maybe I should put that here.&lt;br /&gt;Uh, outputs,&lt;br /&gt;um, social images, we said this, uh, featured images, uh, oh e let me just say ebook coverage,&lt;br /&gt;just in the realm of possibility here. Yep.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: Slides was the thing that got you your gears turning early on.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: I was thinking of tip boxes. Lemme see if I can share my screen. Nope. I have to&lt;br /&gt;close the Y board. I was on, uh, CAO&amp;#8217;s website looking at their di i y lighting kit and they had a&lt;br /&gt;pullout with a tip. Oh, okay. So I, I don&amp;#8217;t know how to call, like pull out, pull out boxes and I&lt;br /&gt;guess that could be quotes&lt;br /&gt;they call to action. Hmm. Um, like, [00:41:00] well, let&amp;#8217;s put ads, ads into Oh yeah. Post et&lt;br /&gt;cetera. Wow. Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: Wow. Wow. Ads like auto ad gener, ad ad image generator from a Woo&lt;br /&gt;commerce product. Mm. Holy crap.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: That could be coupons, like mm-hmm. I, I was even thinking your HTML side, cuz&lt;br /&gt;you&amp;#8217;re generating H M L and then you&amp;#8217;re taking the snapshot of it.&lt;br /&gt;But like, you know, Kohl&amp;#8217;s or Bed Bath and Beyond, you know, they have a coupon and it looks&lt;br /&gt;like a little coupon thing. And I mean, if there&amp;#8217;s HTML, if we&amp;#8217;re generating HTML, don&amp;#8217;t even, you&lt;br /&gt;don&amp;#8217;t have to go to the screenshot if you don&amp;#8217;t want to, but like, you could put that with a little&lt;br /&gt;dressing that kind of calls it out, so.&lt;br /&gt;Yep. Um,[00:42:00]&lt;br /&gt;okay, let me, let&amp;#8217;s do this for a second. Let&amp;#8217;s take this marketing because I think we, there&amp;#8217;s the&lt;br /&gt;big market, bigger market there. It&amp;#8217;s a lot of the users. When I think about creating a blog post,&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#8217;m thinking about organic search traffic primarily. Um, But so that it gets placed in the search&lt;br /&gt;engine, uh, it gets ranked and then traffic comes to that page.&lt;br /&gt;When they get on page, then I want them to do something. This is where, you know, Optum&lt;br /&gt;monitor or popup thing is like compelling because it&amp;#8217;s, you get attention, like offer free offer&lt;br /&gt;inside, right?&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: Kind of thing. Yeah. It turns, it turns passive into, uh, there&amp;#8217;s ac there&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;something&amp;#8217;s actionable. Yeah. So it&amp;#8217;s not, don&amp;#8217;t just consume, like, and so this is where you&amp;#8217;ve&lt;br /&gt;got, uh, share these, bookmark these, you know, it&amp;#8217;s like, so I&amp;#8217;m reading somebody&amp;#8217;s article and&lt;br /&gt;yet I get a popup that says, [00:43:00] want more great content like this?&lt;br /&gt;Sign up. Want an ebook of related content? Sign up. Um, here, share buttons. Please share this&lt;br /&gt;on, you know, if you got value out of this, share this on Twitter. Um, email it to a friend. Um, but&lt;br /&gt;thinking in terms of, yeah, images, um, so, you know, if we&amp;#8217;re just talking content, written words,&lt;br /&gt;then, um, my, the featured image that you&amp;#8217;d see ideally would be stylized, something that fits in&lt;br /&gt;with your site.&lt;br /&gt;But if you ask a guest to share this story on Twitter, big pretty image is obviously more&lt;br /&gt;compelling than just a, a headline. Um, but you don&amp;#8217;t want to share the featured image because&lt;br /&gt;the featured image probably doesn&amp;#8217;t have, uh, the title of the post. Uh, it might or might not, but&lt;br /&gt;it certainly, what I, what I thought you, a brilliant idea you came up with was, [00:44:00] you&lt;br /&gt;know, a featured image with a, or, or a shareable image, which is the featured includes the&lt;br /&gt;featured image, the title of the post, and then one or two.&lt;br /&gt;It could be the excerpt, it could be one or two bullet points, but, so it&amp;#8217;s like if I go to share, if I&lt;br /&gt;read an article, You know, and it has a pretty image of a, some sunset and it says, best places&lt;br /&gt;to retirement, retire to, okay. But if I&amp;#8217;m sharing an image on Twitter, the image that I share should&lt;br /&gt;say the best places to retire to should have the sunset in the background.&lt;br /&gt;And then, you know, a, a tag, an excerpt that says the results will blow you away. Total click bait.&lt;br /&gt;Or, you know, the top, you know, should say the top five, Hawaii, Alaska, blah, blah, blah. You&lt;br /&gt;know, click to read the rest of &amp;#8217;em, kind of thing. So then it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s, um, you know, and that&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;different from the featured image and that&amp;#8217;s different from, that&amp;#8217;s the type of thing you&amp;#8217;d run over&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;to Canva and, and generate and, and maybe [00:45:00] generate in a number of different sizes&lt;br /&gt;and shapes to then push, you know, drag into buffer or whatever you use to schedule your&lt;br /&gt;socials or to broadcast your socials.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely wanna make sure we don&amp;#8217;t get into that realm. Um, Because interacting with all those&lt;br /&gt;APIs is a nightmare, and there&amp;#8217;s a hundred of those tools already. But, um, oh, and, um, Yost, sh&lt;br /&gt;uh, the OG image, uh, is the other one. So again, if an image that&amp;#8217;s different from you&amp;#8217;ve got&lt;br /&gt;your featured image, you go and you, you pa paste the URL into Twitter or into Slack, and you&lt;br /&gt;get that little preview card, that&amp;#8217;s your open graph image.&lt;br /&gt;Twitter now has Twitter cards, which is their version. And so again, having different, different&lt;br /&gt;versions generated for all of these things. And some of this I think we can do even behind the&lt;br /&gt;scenes, which I think will be really, really neat. And then some of this I think could be, and then&lt;br /&gt;it&amp;#8217;s like, [00:46:00] so maybe that&amp;#8217;s where, you know, we&amp;#8217;re, we&amp;#8217;re, we haven&amp;#8217;t yet talked about.&lt;br /&gt;I mean, we&amp;#8217;re not, we&amp;#8217;re not ready yet to talk about business models and that kind of thing, but&lt;br /&gt;hypothetically, a. Beginner version that just does a couple of the basic things. Here&amp;#8217;s a&lt;br /&gt;shareable image. Um, or here&amp;#8217;s the, the open graph image for every post, every product&lt;br /&gt;automatically generated, done. Um, and that&amp;#8217;s not necessar.&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#8217;s maybe something that people can set and forget kind of thing. But then we&amp;#8217;re also talking&lt;br /&gt;about, in my mind at least, we&amp;#8217;re talking about something that approaches more of a Canva kind&lt;br /&gt;of functionality for marketers. So it&amp;#8217;s like, yes, the, the basics are covered, the incoming stuff is&lt;br /&gt;covered, or the quick share, uh, in Slack preview is covered.&lt;br /&gt;Um, but then talking about, you know, saying, okay, now I need the list of assets that I&amp;#8217;ve&lt;br /&gt;[00:47:00] predefined, I wanna slide for, um, you know, for social medias. Cuz it&amp;#8217;s like, and if&lt;br /&gt;you. If you&amp;#8217;re doing it right, air quotes, right? You are not posting about a, a blog post once you&lt;br /&gt;are not, uh, putting an image into or putting a product into woo commerce, tweeting about it&lt;br /&gt;once and then hoping that it sells a gajillion, you are again, creating a campaign that says, okay,&lt;br /&gt;you know, over the next six months, tweet about this every couple of days, every then, every&lt;br /&gt;few days in it, every once a week.&lt;br /&gt;And you sort of, you might peter off, but there&amp;#8217;s this arc and you want those images to be&lt;br /&gt;potentially to be different every time. And so it&amp;#8217;s like, could you generate a bunch of images that&lt;br /&gt;then get cued, um, you know, on all different platforms. And so it&amp;#8217;s like potentially you&amp;#8217;re talking&lt;br /&gt;about, um, oh, I think the other neat thing that you mentioned in a previous conversation was&lt;br /&gt;like, Answer a few questions, [00:48:00] right?&lt;br /&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s like word w WordPress is already gonna ask you for an excerpt fine. But it&amp;#8217;s like, what are&lt;br /&gt;three bullet points? What are two or three quotes? And then if it auto-generated a whole bunch&lt;br /&gt;of images that had the quotes, that had the, um, oh, you know what, uh, uh, what&amp;#8217;s analogous?&lt;br /&gt;Like there&amp;#8217;s, um, what&amp;#8217;s it called?&lt;br /&gt;Um, I have a book marked, um, avatar Image. Photo.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Oh, yeah. Avatars.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: So there&amp;#8217;s, um, yeah. Avatars. And so basically kind of creating little avatar&lt;br /&gt;images for, um,&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: I mean, profile cards, you know, like, right.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: So yeah. So p fp maker.com. P fp maker mm-hmm. Profile pick maker. Is what&lt;br /&gt;it&amp;#8217;s short for, right? But you upload a photo of yourself, it, it [00:49:00] strips the background out,&lt;br /&gt;and then it, and then it just delivers you a page full of avatars.&lt;br /&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s your photo over and over again, but all these different funky backgrounds. And so you&lt;br /&gt;scroll through them and you&amp;#8217;re like, Ooh, I like that one. I like that one. I like that one. Um, I&lt;br /&gt;think, yeah, go to my Twitter account and you&amp;#8217;ll see one, and I use this to just like, I go, I upload&lt;br /&gt;this to, we&amp;#8217;ve looked at the, um, sticker mule background remover kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and I think there&amp;#8217;s, remove.bg was one that I just found recently. That&amp;#8217;s a great r l. But so&lt;br /&gt;it&amp;#8217;s like you create an image, you take an image of yourself, you use a tool to strip the&lt;br /&gt;background, and then you upload it here. And now you&amp;#8217;ve got, you know, a dozen or two or&lt;br /&gt;three dozen different backgrounds and they&amp;#8217;ve got ones with palm trees and the Eiffel Tower,&lt;br /&gt;which is fun, right?&lt;br /&gt;But so picturing like, You know, you write a blog post, you create a new Woo commerce product,&lt;br /&gt;you go, you, you hit publish. And, and then, you know, our plugin essentially says, okay,&lt;br /&gt;[00:50:00] you&amp;#8217;re ready to create marketing assets. Um, what do you want to create today?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Twitter, Instagram, you know, and then, great, what&amp;#8217;s, what&amp;#8217;s the headline, which we can auto,&lt;br /&gt;auto pull.&lt;br /&gt;Um, what&amp;#8217;s the excerpt? We, again, we can auto pull, um, featured image to start with, right?&lt;br /&gt;But maybe you wanna upload other ones. Um, what are three bullet points? What are some pull&lt;br /&gt;quotes? What are some benefi, you know, we can sort of customize a questionnaire that says,&lt;br /&gt;fill these in, generate. And then now you&amp;#8217;ve got essentially a matrix that&amp;#8217;s like, you know, an&lt;br /&gt;image for Twitter, an image for Facebook, an image for do, do, do, do.&lt;br /&gt;And going across. You&amp;#8217;ve got quote, quote, Bullet point, bullet point, bullet point, style, style,&lt;br /&gt;style, um, you know, light mode, dark mode, play with fonts kind of thing. Um mm-hmm. You&lt;br /&gt;know, and it, and so you suddenly, you&amp;#8217;ve got a catalog of generated relevant images designed&lt;br /&gt;to go on a bunch of different platforms and you&amp;#8217;d [00:51:00] go, okay, yep, this one works.&lt;br /&gt;This one works, this one&amp;#8217;s silly. Ignore it, you know, whatever. Um, but&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: so in, yeah, so in this, um, I went to the ChatGPT my researcher Yep. And, um,&lt;br /&gt;image SEO came out and I was like, okay, if I&amp;#8217;m embodying, um, I&amp;#8217;m trying to do this, I&amp;#8217;m&lt;br /&gt;publishing site content in order to get ranked in Google. And you get on here, if you&amp;#8217;ve done all&lt;br /&gt;the work to do an SEO o keyword blog post, you&amp;#8217;re using WordPress.&lt;br /&gt;Great platform to do that. You go what was be one extra while you&amp;#8217;re already there to get a little&lt;br /&gt;bit extra stuff. Mm-hmm. And this Image SEO thing popped up in the list that I asked. Mm-hmm.&lt;br /&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s kind of compelling. Um,&lt;br /&gt;and I read something just a second ago, uh, and I checked out your profile maker too. That&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;super cool. [00:52:00] Um, half of all Google searches end on the searcher. So wait, I&amp;#8217;m sorry. I&lt;br /&gt;thought I was saying how, how big SEO image SEO is, but we&amp;#8217;re kind of saying that with the&lt;br /&gt;social images too, is you&amp;#8217;ve got this thing, there&amp;#8217;s ways you can distribute your content in a way&lt;br /&gt;out to the different platforms.&lt;br /&gt;But I go Google too. Like I image should be, if we land on this should be a part of this&lt;br /&gt;conversation. Mm-hmm. Because then you&amp;#8217;re going, okay, ex. I mean, what if you could take&lt;br /&gt;your blog posts, they get all this traffic and increase it by 10%? That&amp;#8217;s a headline. Wow. Or the,&lt;br /&gt;the product. So, you know, well, like you talked about e-commerce, um, what if there&amp;#8217;s a way to&lt;br /&gt;generate, easily an image that could be feature post featured image post or [00:53:00]&lt;br /&gt;something in, in the thing.&lt;br /&gt;But it also gets some SEO ranking when they&amp;#8217;re going, and I don&amp;#8217;t, I don&amp;#8217;t do this myself, but,&lt;br /&gt;um, I don&amp;#8217;t look for images in Google necessarily, but it just compelling to kind explore that. Do&lt;br /&gt;you? Okay. Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: Like we talked about, I think, I think it would be really interesting to know, like, I, I&lt;br /&gt;make the assumption that Google looks at images more than alt tag, title tag.&lt;br /&gt;Like, I think we&amp;#8217;re to the point. I, I, I.&lt;br /&gt;Safe assumption, I don&amp;#8217;t know. Um, but I assume that Google can, if they look at a blog post,&lt;br /&gt;they look at the image, they read the alag, but then they actually parse the image and say, yes,&lt;br /&gt;this is in fact an image of a sunset when we&amp;#8217;re talking about places to vacation. I don&amp;#8217;t know if&lt;br /&gt;that&amp;#8217;s true. I&amp;#8217;d love to find out if that&amp;#8217;s [00:54:00] true.&lt;br /&gt;But it&amp;#8217;s like, so if you have an image that has words on it, I mean, at this point when I open an&lt;br /&gt;image with words on it in, you know, Mac preview or Microsoft Paint, the words are editable. So&lt;br /&gt;the, uh, algorithm for parsing text in an image is so commonplace now that it&amp;#8217;s built into the, the&lt;br /&gt;free image editor on, on Mac Os.&lt;br /&gt;So I have to assume that it&amp;#8217;s that pervasive everywhere. So, Um, you know, so is there a, an&lt;br /&gt;SEO benefit to having words in an image that then gets shared? Um mm-hmm. Or no?&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Well, I mean, I would go, if you&amp;#8217;re gonna post an image, you know, your tourism,&lt;br /&gt;your e-commerce shop, you&amp;#8217;re, why not? You&amp;#8217;ve already got the images there.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. Um, you should be doing some image sto. I mean, that&amp;#8217;s just easy, you know, a little bit&lt;br /&gt;more effort and you&amp;#8217;re able to, [00:55:00] I don&amp;#8217;t know, cast a net water, but I go, if you&amp;#8217;re gonna&lt;br /&gt;post, uh, I don&amp;#8217;t know, air compressors in somebody&amp;#8217;s trying to find, you know, whatever the&lt;br /&gt;reason they might be looking for that.&lt;br /&gt;But you post a picture of the image compressor, that&amp;#8217;s one thing. But I&amp;#8217;ve seen more images too&lt;br /&gt;come up where it&amp;#8217;s like, put a little bit of text on there or it branded, you know, or I don&amp;#8217;t know. I&lt;br /&gt;like that mindset of going, how do we help them get a little bit more. Um, reach from something&lt;br /&gt;they&amp;#8217;re probably already doing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Corey Maass: Um, right. I googled how to do image seo and one of the results that came up,&lt;br /&gt;so the first sponsored post, uh, is the, the image next to it is dude on laptop. The, the image&lt;br /&gt;adds nothing to the headline, how to optimize images for websites. And [00:56:00] there&amp;#8217;s a&lt;br /&gt;picture of a dude with a, with a laptop, no value, no context, like if that image came outta&lt;br /&gt;context, there&amp;#8217;s nothing there.&lt;br /&gt;Scroll down, um, to another one. 10 steps to optimize images for seo, and next to it is a card&lt;br /&gt;that has. People, you know, a little graphic of people. Awesome. But it&amp;#8217;s in, in text, even though&lt;br /&gt;the image is this big in text that almost fills the card. It has the same headline, 10 steps to&lt;br /&gt;optimize images for seo.&lt;br /&gt;And there&amp;#8217;s a little logo of the website that it&amp;#8217;s on, and if I click on it and it gets bigger, there&amp;#8217;s the&lt;br /&gt;subtitle that&amp;#8217;s like, you know, who&amp;#8217;s who. It&amp;#8217;s by when it was posted. Um, you know, and it&amp;#8217;s like&lt;br /&gt;right there. That&amp;#8217;s the image that we&amp;#8217;re talking, we&amp;#8217;re talking about generating, but somebody&lt;br /&gt;had to go in and create that card.&lt;br /&gt;Well, so I figure if, if, if the, if the third result for searching for Google for [00:57:00] Image SEO&lt;br /&gt;is an article about optimizing images for seo, and they include an image that has words on it.&lt;br /&gt;You know, and, and like, I mean, we we&amp;#8217;re talking about Google, you know, the, the automation,&lt;br /&gt;the bots, the algorithms, the, you know, the ai, whatever. But I mean, the obvious benefit is of&lt;br /&gt;just human stuff is obvious. Like putting something on Twitter, an image that has words rather&lt;br /&gt;than an image of just a dude on a laptop.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. Obvi, you know, obvious value, but, well, but we do, I thought about Pinterest.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Mm-hmm. Yep. Oh yeah. It&amp;#8217;s, I forget about it all the time, but I mean, there&amp;#8217;s so&lt;br /&gt;many that go, like, it&amp;#8217;s a pin and you&amp;#8217;re looking for stuff and mm-hmm. You know, taking, it&amp;#8217;s a&lt;br /&gt;way to get a tra traffic back to your post about it.&lt;br /&gt;Well put enough detail that entices them to come over. Yep. Um, okay. I wanna get back to&lt;br /&gt;[00:58:00] this. Okay. I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m doing a post and, and may, maybe there&amp;#8217;s others, but I think about&lt;br /&gt;just. I spent my career with the organic SEO content, um, and I get somebody to the site, and&lt;br /&gt;that&amp;#8217;s the first part of the big, the whole process, just getting someone to the site.&lt;br /&gt;Um, it talked about like popups help you, you know, do that. Mm-hmm. There&amp;#8217;s inbound content,&lt;br /&gt;like now that we have patterns within Gutenberg, code editor, block editor, like inserting&lt;br /&gt;something called a action within that. Um, my traditional has been get &amp;#8217;em on the site and give&lt;br /&gt;them some offer that fills irresistible discount, ebook, lead magnet, you know, opt into the&lt;br /&gt;newsletter thing.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: Yep.[00:59:00]&lt;br /&gt;And I&amp;#8217;m, and I, what I&amp;#8217;m thinking is, Sim similar to our previous conversations. You know, it&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;gonna take a handful of conversations to continue to unearth all of these possibilities, right?&lt;br /&gt;This list, which already is 10 points long, is gonna be a lot longer. And so I want some&lt;br /&gt;confirmation, like there&amp;#8217;s, there&amp;#8217;s an, to me, there&amp;#8217;s an obvious benefit of like what I just&lt;br /&gt;described.&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#8217;m seeing a card, a text on it that somebody had to generate. Do we, can we confirm that your&lt;br /&gt;average team of one a person who&amp;#8217;s blogging, um, recipe, ooh, recipe cards, um, do they.&lt;br /&gt;[01:00:00] More of these images generated and or are they already trying to generate these&lt;br /&gt;images? Are they, you know, is, is the average, um, person, you know, a team of one or two,&lt;br /&gt;um, who&amp;#8217;s got a, a YouTube vlog or a recipe blog or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;Are they posting their article with the recipe? And then what are the next steps they take? Like,&lt;br /&gt;that&amp;#8217;s the broad question. Do they then go generate images to then put on socials and how do&lt;br /&gt;they schedule, you know, all that stuff? What are the images that they actually care about? Um,&lt;br /&gt;to me the, the gut assumption is there are enough people doing something as a next step.&lt;br /&gt;And so I&amp;#8217;m inclined to. Um, again, get to a point where I&amp;#8217;ve essentially solved a problem for&lt;br /&gt;generating something. And to me, I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m, I have no problem solving this for me [01:01:00] and&lt;br /&gt;you to start with. Mm-hmm. Um, where I&amp;#8217;m generating my images from my music blog, I&amp;#8217;m&lt;br /&gt;generating a couple of basic templates for Instagram, whatever, me as a musician to promote.&lt;br /&gt;Um, again, I&amp;#8217;m looking at my clients like, what do they need? So a basic Twitter image with a&lt;br /&gt;headline that has a logo on it. Um, and then for you, the post status, um, banners make, how do&lt;br /&gt;we make them all look the same? So again, a logo and, you know, if, if these are all, um, I think&lt;br /&gt;what we looked at, right? Were profiles of people.&lt;br /&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s upload a picture of the person, post status logo on the left, maybe their name and, um,&lt;br /&gt;you know, and, and something from the, you know, and, and then. And then it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s, to me, it&amp;#8217;s,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#8217;s up to, again, we&amp;#8217;re looking for feedback and or you doing some interviews to find out like,&lt;br /&gt;yes, everybody, everybody wants Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, [01:02:00] LinkedIn, like the&lt;br /&gt;obvious socials.&lt;br /&gt;Um, or yes, people desperately wish that there were slides. Like, I love your interest in slides,&lt;br /&gt;but you&amp;#8217;re the only person I&amp;#8217;ve ever heard of that says that. Um, which doesn&amp;#8217;t dismiss it. It just&lt;br /&gt;means like, that&amp;#8217;s not the circle I&amp;#8217;m in, right? So, um, yeah, that&amp;#8217;s, to me, that&amp;#8217;s not something we&lt;br /&gt;want to generate first, but go find me 10 people that are gonna find that interesting.&lt;br /&gt;Or if I get you to a point where you can sit down and generate pro templates yourself, you&amp;#8217;ll be&lt;br /&gt;like, cool, let me go build a slide one, because that&amp;#8217;s what I want. And then, and then cuz it&amp;#8217;s like&lt;br /&gt;once, it&amp;#8217;s kind of like Canva, like, you know, that they have somebody on staff whose job it is to&lt;br /&gt;just crank out templates mm-hmm.&lt;br /&gt;To solve all these little problems. Oh, whoops. We don&amp;#8217;t have one for podcasts. Great. 3000 by&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol start=&quot;3000&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go, go generate that. Oh, there you go. Podcast. Um, yeah. Add that to your list. Um, or&lt;br /&gt;we don&amp;#8217;t, you know, [01:03:00] people are posting record their, their new album on, on&lt;br /&gt;Bandcamp. What, how do you know an image generator for Bandcamp that I&amp;#8217;m talking about&lt;br /&gt;back to Canva?&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like they, because they&amp;#8217;re going, they&amp;#8217;re going inch deep, mile wide, you know. Yeah. So&lt;br /&gt;they, they want one of everything, but there&amp;#8217;s, you know, and for them, there&amp;#8217;s s e o value, like,&lt;br /&gt;you know, there&amp;#8217;s a landing page for every single template they have. Because that way&lt;br /&gt;anybody who&amp;#8217;s googling for anything, you know, album cover template, they&amp;#8217;re, they&amp;#8217;re hoping to&lt;br /&gt;pop up.&lt;br /&gt;Mm-hmm. We&amp;#8217;ll get there once we have the delivery system for templates, essentially. Um, and&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not saying we necessarily want to, like, we don&amp;#8217;t wanna start there, like let&amp;#8217;s find some clear&lt;br /&gt;answers of, of what templates to build first, what, what problems to solve first.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: I, I&amp;#8217;m still, uh, still so compelled by the slide content and I put in the crazy ideas&lt;br /&gt;column Here is, uh, LinkedIn [01:04:00] slide content.&lt;br /&gt;So the AJ told me about, find this link for you. Um, this service, it&amp;#8217;s like a LinkedIn. You&amp;#8217;ve seen&lt;br /&gt;this on Instagram too. Um, I&amp;#8217;ll find it. It&amp;#8217;s a LinkedIn image carousel creator. You put your tweet in&lt;br /&gt;and it&amp;#8217;ll give you the, the slide content. Oh, Uhhuh. You know, when I tested that on LinkedIn&lt;br /&gt;several years ago, my slide content got way more views than anything else I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;And, uh, so I think even like for LinkedIn, um, you think about it, it&amp;#8217;s like busy professionals used&lt;br /&gt;to a common language of slides. Yep. Uh, and then being able to quickly get the information&lt;br /&gt;without having to go through 1500 words. Yep. It&amp;#8217;s still compelling to me.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: Um, well, and, and a, a neat coincidence, right?&lt;br /&gt;I was like everybody else, I&amp;#8217;m looking at, um, Twitter threads [01:05:00] about chat g p t&lt;br /&gt;prompts. Um, or you know, what, what are 10 neat things that have happened in the 48 hours&lt;br /&gt;since they released ChatGPT four, um, you know, people have generated re had it generate a&lt;br /&gt;working version of pong, uh, in 60 seconds. I&amp;#8217;d mean ridiculous things.&lt;br /&gt;But one of the things that I saw was that I, that I was like, oh, this is actually relevant to the&lt;br /&gt;world. Um, other than recreating pong, um, Is somebody dumped in an article and said, make,&lt;br /&gt;make 10 slides. And it did. And I, yeah, they&amp;#8217;re not styled or anything, but it&amp;#8217;s just, here are the&lt;br /&gt;bullet points that you&amp;#8217;d wanna put on each.&lt;br /&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s like, uh, you know, have this talk to AI that then gen, you know, write a blog post, click a&lt;br /&gt;button, chat, g p t or some other AI generates the slide content. We generate the slide images.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. Yeah. Holy crap.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Yeah. On that [01:06:00] link too for you.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: Um, okay, so we&amp;#8217;re over an hour. Where do we go? What&amp;#8217;s next? How do we&lt;br /&gt;start?&lt;br /&gt;What do you wanna do? What are you gonna do today? Um, what do you want me to do? Who&lt;br /&gt;are we gonna talk to? How are we gonna get clients? I think,&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: I think, um, one area to explore is, um, talking to content journey. Seeing the output&lt;br /&gt;of what they&amp;#8217;re doing, asking about the problems and challenges they have in that process for&lt;br /&gt;their clients.&lt;br /&gt;Um, I just forgot, I think there&amp;#8217;s an opportunity here to potentially innovate in this of here&amp;#8217;s how&lt;br /&gt;this is going, here&amp;#8217;s how people do, what is the way to help you stand out? Hmm. So the&lt;br /&gt;standout, and that&amp;#8217;s why I say innovate, not just helping cure the workflow issue, but I think&lt;br /&gt;[01:07:00] one thing I wanna really explore this time is can we innovate with something?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s where I think the slide content, you know, whether it&amp;#8217;s a valid thing or not, is in that realm&lt;br /&gt;of they&amp;#8217;re doing something. What&amp;#8217;s way, one way that could help that content stand out even&lt;br /&gt;more. It, it includes social images, it includes STO image, SEO and stuff like that. Um, I was&lt;br /&gt;like, Lindsay has a mental health treatment center client.&lt;br /&gt;And, and that&amp;#8217;s probably one of their best case studies because they took a, aside from, you&lt;br /&gt;know, rarely getting any content to, uh, tenant, I mean considerable. And it drove a lot of&lt;br /&gt;business for &amp;#8217;em. And, uh, you think about it, like I, I, I remember talking to him cuz I did some&lt;br /&gt;consulting with them, with the client and they&amp;#8217;re trying to find images.&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#8217;s another issue we&amp;#8217;ve talked about, but it&amp;#8217;s out, that&amp;#8217;s out there. It&amp;#8217;s for somebody else&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;saw potentially. But you go, if they&amp;#8217;re doing the image, what&amp;#8217;s something that could help that&lt;br /&gt;stand out? And it&amp;#8217;s maybe a pull quote. [01:08:00] Mm-hmm. You know, from it or something like&lt;br /&gt;that. That&amp;#8217;s where I want to dig in is, um, I&amp;#8217;ll talk to Emily over there.&lt;br /&gt;Um, And, uh, ask some of that. They&amp;#8217;ve got another service called my marketing assistant too.&lt;br /&gt;And I&amp;#8217;ll ask, what are some of the anonymized, um, client requests they get? Yeah, sure. They&lt;br /&gt;do have a podcaster in their beta program. Um, prolific podcaster who uses a lot of the&lt;br /&gt;distributed media. Um, like I think he probably uses his website as the base, but, um, a lot of the&lt;br /&gt;requests he&amp;#8217;s getting is, you know, create the thumbnails for those things that they do, use those&lt;br /&gt;tools that we talked about.&lt;br /&gt;But, uh, I think one thing that might give us an edge on this is just like creating a new standard&lt;br /&gt;where everybody&amp;#8217;s going like, whoa, whoa, how&amp;#8217;d they do that? I want that too. Like I was telling&lt;br /&gt;you about the Casto little tip box and stuff. [01:09:00] Um, so that&amp;#8217;s what I would like to explore&lt;br /&gt;in this and then just understand their process a little bit better.&lt;br /&gt;And what would be something that doesn&amp;#8217;t take a lot of time. But then enhances uh, the content&lt;br /&gt;and makes it stand out a little bit more. And I mean, it could be that whole call to action thing,&lt;br /&gt;you know? Um, like a, being able to stylize some, you know, for the treatment center it&amp;#8217;s call us.&lt;br /&gt;Cuz if they call, if someone calls the treatment center, they can really help them and understand&lt;br /&gt;what the right fit is and all that kinda stuff.&lt;br /&gt;So their call to action is, you know, I think it still is the case, but if they get a phone call, that&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;great. That&amp;#8217;s where they want to be. And then that turns over their sales operation. I&amp;#8217;m trying to&lt;br /&gt;think of another client. Um, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of b2b, so, um, B2B there too. That seems like&lt;br /&gt;[01:10:00] another area where maybe big companies have innovated with the B2B space.&lt;br /&gt;Let me put that in here cause I don&amp;#8217;t want to drop this. Like, I have a friend that has a&lt;br /&gt;manufacturing company. He does the air condit, the cooling compressor stuff. He remanufacture&lt;br /&gt;them. And, uh, I mean, there&amp;#8217;s a space with people with money, um, and it&amp;#8217;s business money.&lt;br /&gt;They go, oh, if it helps increase whatever their KPI is.&lt;br /&gt;I mean, that&amp;#8217;s, that&amp;#8217;s pretty big.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: Yeah. And I&amp;#8217;ve got, I was just pinging, um, people within my client teams of like,&lt;br /&gt;okay, who generates social media content so that I can line up an interview, talk to them about,&lt;br /&gt;okay, what&amp;#8217;s your process? Um, and I, and what&amp;#8217;s kind of neat is, is again, I&amp;#8217;ve got. It&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;technically the same, same [01:11:00] client, but I&amp;#8217;ve got two websites, two teams that approach&lt;br /&gt;things very differently.&lt;br /&gt;One is, um, a lot more tech savvy and a lot more, um, trendy or, or, you know, they are active on&lt;br /&gt;TikTok. We are advertising on TikTok, stuff like that. And the other one is, is a fairly traditional&lt;br /&gt;news content magazine. Um, and, uh, with, and the, and the team is a lot less technical and we,&lt;br /&gt;and we don&amp;#8217;t need to be nearly as cutting edge or edge or trendy.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and so I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;ve kind of got a young hip social media marketer wizard, and then I&amp;#8217;ve also got&lt;br /&gt;people that are like, I write the article and then I go put it on Twitter. Um, and, and so I can kind&lt;br /&gt;of see how, how two of these very different approaches go about solving more or less the same&lt;br /&gt;problem. Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: And that featured image summary card type thing I think is still [01:12:00] really&lt;br /&gt;compelling. I&amp;#8217;m gonna highlight that. Where&amp;#8217;s that? Yeah, I,&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: I, that&amp;#8217;s a very quick, easy win for anybody, not for us specifically. It&amp;#8217;s like make&lt;br /&gt;your featured image more compelling and, and much more valuable when shared.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: And because again, you know, look at outputs for that, you go, well that&amp;#8217;s a&lt;br /&gt;Pinterest thing. I mean, maybe that doesn&amp;#8217;t get pinned, but it&amp;#8217;s a social card. It could have&lt;br /&gt;possibilities for the Pinterest stuff. It&amp;#8217;s a visual thing that en might entice someone to go, oh,&lt;br /&gt;that&amp;#8217;s interesting. Um, and that stuff like to just do that pull image from post add overlay of.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There you go. Print, you know, I mean, as simple as that with the brand logo. Yep. Dacon or&lt;br /&gt;something like that. Yep,&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: yep. [01:13:00] Okay. Yeah. And there&amp;#8217;s, and there&amp;#8217;s, yeah, and there&amp;#8217;s, there&amp;#8217;s a&lt;br /&gt;couple of plugins out there that do something that touch on that. Um, and I&amp;#8217;ve, I messed around&lt;br /&gt;with one, not the other of the two that I know of, but they, they were, at least at the time, were,&lt;br /&gt;were limited to generating, um, an open graph image.&lt;br /&gt;I was like, generate image, paste it into Slack, you see the image. And I, and I was like, great,&lt;br /&gt;but I, where do I write? Click Save as so that I can go post it to Twitter. Mm-hmm. It&amp;#8217;s like, oh,&lt;br /&gt;you know, it&amp;#8217;s, you know, it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s just in, it&amp;#8217;s in your media library. It&amp;#8217;s like, okay, well, And then&lt;br /&gt;also what about all these other solutions or other scenarios?&lt;br /&gt;Um, for me, I was just originally thinking the big socials, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,&lt;br /&gt;Instagram. The big difference being 16, nine or square. But now we&amp;#8217;re talking about, it&amp;#8217;s like,&lt;br /&gt;yeah, either easy ways to generate multiple variations and [01:14:00] stuff. It&amp;#8217;s like this could go&lt;br /&gt;a lot, a lot further. Um, so, but it&amp;#8217;s, but I definitely, you know, there&amp;#8217;s to talk about, you know,&lt;br /&gt;people talk about competition.&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like, oh, the competition is Photoshop, Canva, um, nothing, nothing is always a, a&lt;br /&gt;competitor. Um, you know, but also I, you know, there are other WordPress plugins that do&lt;br /&gt;touch on this, so we&amp;#8217;ll have to do a little research there too.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Yeah, like the nothing part is me. Um, I created a blog post and then it&amp;#8217;d be&lt;br /&gt;probably nice to have some visual.&lt;br /&gt;Icon, thumbnail featured image that, um, highlight some points in there, but, um, okay. That&amp;#8217;ll be,&lt;br /&gt;mine is exploring that with, uh, I&amp;#8217;ll start with Emily cause she&amp;#8217;s doing a lot of the team interface,&lt;br /&gt;[01:15:00] cl team, client interface stuff. She seemed a pretty good volume of work. I like the&lt;br /&gt;marketing angle. How do we, cuz that could go across any of these potential avatars if we&amp;#8217;re&lt;br /&gt;helping them do better marketing, um, redistribution, that&amp;#8217;s the social images of seo, all that kind&lt;br /&gt;of stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: Yeah. Um, well, and um, again, I,&lt;br /&gt;I wanna say I put my foot down cuz I think that&amp;#8217;s a hilarious phrase. In a Mad Men 1960s&lt;br /&gt;husband sort of way. I don&amp;#8217;t make me put my foot down. Um, but I, I, I want to, I very adamantly&lt;br /&gt;wanna draw the line at doing the posting or interacting with the socials. Um, other than like, we&lt;br /&gt;can have a button that says, post this to Twitter and it just links, you know, we&amp;#8217;ll throw you over&lt;br /&gt;there kind of thing.&lt;br /&gt;Cuz I&amp;#8217;ve actually even, I [01:16:00] built a plugin at one point that you could queue up tweets,&lt;br /&gt;but it&amp;#8217;s like, it worked. But, you know, with all the drama around Twitter, a p i lately, let alone for&lt;br /&gt;the last Yeah. 10 years, like, I don&amp;#8217;t want to get into that. But, um, you know, one, one of the, we&lt;br /&gt;were talking about. What are we talking about?&lt;br /&gt;We must have been talking about, um, integration points with other tools, um, for Crop Express&lt;br /&gt;anyway, it&amp;#8217;s like, so if we generate images and then, and then I, you know, let&amp;#8217;s, we can look at,&lt;br /&gt;um, auto, you know, if you generate an, an open graph image that Yost automatically picks that&lt;br /&gt;up. Um, so there&amp;#8217;s an integration point.&lt;br /&gt;Um, I use Buffer to post to mild my socials. Maybe they have an API or an integration point. So&lt;br /&gt;it&amp;#8217;s like we can, you know, there&amp;#8217;s gonna be a potential for not only generating the images, but at&lt;br /&gt;least getting them to the services that use those images. I don&amp;#8217;t wanna become those [01:17:00]&lt;br /&gt;services, but you know, there&amp;#8217;s, we&amp;#8217;ve, we&amp;#8217;ve got an opportunity there too.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Yeah. Okay. I put integrations with SEO plugins. Um,&lt;br /&gt;That, that question&lt;br /&gt;when I talk to Emily, I&amp;#8217;ll ask, um, what, what are the common goals that they&amp;#8217;re, are they trying to&lt;br /&gt;push to a phone number? Are they trying to push to, um, an email list? It&amp;#8217;s probably one of those&lt;br /&gt;two, I would guess is building the appeal, unless social start&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: higher up. Do they even, you know, are they thinking that strategically, like, not to&lt;br /&gt;say the agency [01:18:00] isn&amp;#8217;t or shouldn&amp;#8217;t, but as a client, like if a client comes to &amp;#8217;em as like,&lt;br /&gt;we need images for Twitter, like, because everybody else does or because you under, you&lt;br /&gt;know, they understand.&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#8217;s the value in including a phone number.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Now I do know, I do know, um, a lot of the clients they work with, and these are not&lt;br /&gt;WordPress or tech people, um, social is hot, you know?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Corey Maass: Sure. Um, social hot, why, I guess, right? Mm-hmm. Cynically, are they doing it&lt;br /&gt;because everybody tells them to, you know, are there, are there teenage kids telling them, dad,&lt;br /&gt;you&amp;#8217;ve gotta get your, um, shoe com, you know, your air compressor company on the tos.&lt;br /&gt;And dad goes, okay, son, great, I&amp;#8217;ll do that. You know, or, or are they measuring? [01:19:00] You&lt;br /&gt;know, are they like, what, where does our traffic come from? Oh, we sell most of our air&lt;br /&gt;compressors on Twitter, but not, or probably Facebook, but not on Twitter, and we&amp;#8217;ve never.&lt;br /&gt;Sold anything off of Insta, you know what I mean?&lt;br /&gt;Like, I&amp;#8217;m curious if, if, if, how companies are thinking about these, what am I trying to say? We&lt;br /&gt;know in, especially in the context of this conversation, that there&amp;#8217;s a potential to turn these pat&lt;br /&gt;turn to turn passive images into valuable calls to action. Mm-hmm. To actually generate, you&lt;br /&gt;know, it&amp;#8217;s like I post an image, I post, I post something on Twitter.&lt;br /&gt;It sucks In the featured image. The featured image is, you know, a pretty sunset. It, it might draw&lt;br /&gt;a human&amp;#8217;s attention, but that&amp;#8217;s very different than again the card. Uh, the [01:20:00] s e o card&lt;br /&gt;that I saw here, that&amp;#8217;s like words that are also drawing me in to like a phone number. So it&amp;#8217;s like,&lt;br /&gt;wow, I don&amp;#8217;t even have to click through.&lt;br /&gt;To, uh, to find out a phone number. I&amp;#8217;m just dialing eight eighty eight, et cetera. Mm-hmm. So it&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;like there&amp;#8217;s, I, I&amp;#8217;m curious how people are thinking about it, if they&amp;#8217;re thinking about it, because if&lt;br /&gt;not, like there&amp;#8217;s great opportunity to ask for us to do education, um mm-hmm. And, or cuz it&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;like, we&amp;#8217;ve, we&amp;#8217;ve talked about, this is the first time you&amp;#8217;ve mentioned phone numbers.&lt;br /&gt;Um, so it&amp;#8217;s like, you know, our, our default is like, oh, this is gonna go on Twitter and it&amp;#8217;s gonna&lt;br /&gt;look pretty, it&amp;#8217;s gonna be the title of the post. Um, you know, with bullet points. It&amp;#8217;s a tldr, but like&lt;br /&gt;what you just said I think is amazing of like, imagine if for a small business, if it included the&lt;br /&gt;phone number, the logo, and the phone number.&lt;br /&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s like nobody ever, or the address, right? Mm-hmm. So people don&amp;#8217;t see it on Facebook or&lt;br /&gt;see it on Twitter and they don&amp;#8217;t even have to click through.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: [01:21:00] Mm-hmm. Then it&amp;#8217;s an ad, right? Like, Retail shop coming up with&lt;br /&gt;something, they&amp;#8217;ve got an event, a coupon or something that could, they&amp;#8217;re posting on their&lt;br /&gt;website, so it&amp;#8217;s RSVPs and then having a card that they could just easily go export or, you know,&lt;br /&gt;save or whatever it is, and then they can go post that.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: How is the, we have a, a pie shop in town. How are they generating the image&lt;br /&gt;for their daily specials? Are they going into Canva every day?&lt;br /&gt;Yep. The sandwich shop, the, you know, all the food trucks that are posting their location, and&lt;br /&gt;this is taking it way out of the context of a post.[01:22:00]&lt;br /&gt;Which is where something like Canva makes more sense. Like people are doing it, generating&lt;br /&gt;an image unto itself. Right. My friend, um, Mike has the epic food truck that makes unbelievable&lt;br /&gt;brisket and meat filled happiness, um, out of his food truck. Um, so he has to consistently post&lt;br /&gt;where he&amp;#8217;s at, what are today&amp;#8217;s specials, and this is, and I&amp;#8217;ll post them on the local Facebook&lt;br /&gt;groups and people go running us too.&lt;br /&gt;So I&amp;#8217;m like, okay, I should ask him how he&amp;#8217;s generating and I need to think back. It&amp;#8217;s like, is he&lt;br /&gt;generating images? Is he upload? I kind of feel like he&amp;#8217;s uploading the same logo every time&lt;br /&gt;and then writing the content, but, and so is there value in all of the content being on the image?&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know. I have to think about that.&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure you&amp;#8217;d wanna include the words [01:23:00] too, but, right. Yeah. I might have a&lt;br /&gt;conversation with him.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Yeah, I think that&amp;#8217;d be great. Um, I&amp;#8217;ll do one with, uh, Emily, see where that goes.&lt;br /&gt;And then I, I just shared the, uh, this whiteboard with you in Slack. Great. I have a friend.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much. This is, uh, this is good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Okay. So I got my marching orders to talk to Emily about that, see what they&amp;#8217;re doing, see if&lt;br /&gt;there&amp;#8217;s ideas to like, drive the conversions that they need for post, explore some of the eBooks&lt;br /&gt;too. I put course up here cause I think that&amp;#8217;s another thing. Yep. But, um, yeah, I was thinking&lt;br /&gt;that too.&lt;br /&gt;Corey Maass: Okay. Um, yeah, and I think I&amp;#8217;m gonna talk to, I&amp;#8217;ve got one or two people to talk&lt;br /&gt;to.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and I think, I think I will try to, I, well, I, like I said earlier, like I do want to. Make sure that&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#8217;m wrapping up Crop express properly. [01:24:00] Um, but then, you know, out of sheer&lt;br /&gt;excitement, I imagine I&amp;#8217;ll reopen the, the plugin that I&amp;#8217;d started to build and see if I can get it&lt;br /&gt;working enough to send it to you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okay, cool. All right.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Thanks dude. Talk to you soon. I&amp;#8217;ll be talking to you. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;

They also highlight how managed hosting can help businesses focus on their core operations while leaving the technical aspects to the experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/corymiller303&quot;&gt;Cory Miller&lt;/a&gt; is joined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Professor&quot;&gt;Jess Friedman&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://wp.cloud/&quot;&gt;WP Cloud&lt;/a&gt; discuss how hosting companies can improve their infrastructure and services to provide better performance and reliability to their customers. They also dive into the importance of customer support, the benefits of using managed hosting services, the ethics of data collection, and more. The experience and expertise offered are sure to inspire you to increase your standards of service&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=&quot;wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Takeaways:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul type=&quot;video&quot; class=&quot;wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outsourcing Infrastructure. &lt;/strong&gt;WordPress hosting companies can benefit from outsourcing their infrastructure to specialized providers such as WP Cloud. This can free up their customer support team from dealing with infrastructure-related issues and enable them to focus on providing better customer service and value-added services.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase Customer Satisfaction.&lt;/strong&gt; By democratizing publishing and providing a superior WordPress experience, hosting companies can reduce churn and retain customers who may otherwise switch to other platforms if their WordPress experience is subpar.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Up for Speed.&lt;/strong&gt; While many factors can impact website speed, some of the most important ones include optimizing images, using a content delivery network (CDN), and minimizing the use of plugins. By focusing on these areas, WordPress agencies can help their clients improve their website speed and ultimately provide a better user experience for their visitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper&quot; id=&quot;h-transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cory Miller: [00:00:00] Everybody welcomed back to post status draft. I&amp;#8217;ve got a longtime friend&lt;br /&gt;of mine in the WordPress space. I think we met like 10 years ago, Jesse. Um, but we&amp;#8217;re gonna&lt;br /&gt;be talking about WP Cloud today, and this is part of our product people series. Um, I heard&lt;br /&gt;about WP Cloud, I know Jesse and I was like, Hey, I wanna know more about WP Cloud.&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#8217;s really compelling from what I&amp;#8217;ve heard. Um, but first and foremost, welcome to the podcast.&lt;br /&gt;Jesse. Could you tell us a little bit about your.&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: Yeah. Thanks Corey. And yeah, it probably has been a decade. It&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s, uh,&lt;br /&gt;it&amp;#8217;s awesome to, to be able to, uh, know people like you and be able to work with people like you&lt;br /&gt;for so long.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and that&amp;#8217;s one of the great things about the WordPress community, right? Oh, yeah. Uh,&lt;br /&gt;yeah. So, uh, I, I, uh, got started in WordPress, geez, back in 2005, I think. Uh, I was, uh,&lt;br /&gt;working as a professor at a university and, uh, trying to teach, [00:01:00] uh, students, uh, well&lt;br /&gt;actually I was a student at the time and then later I became a professor and started teaching&lt;br /&gt;WordPress.&lt;br /&gt;Uh, but my professor, Hillary Mason, who&amp;#8217;s actually, used to work at Bitly and is pretty world&lt;br /&gt;renowned, uh, data scientist. She, she turned me onto WordPress and, uh, I never looked back.&lt;br /&gt;Uh, prior to that I was building like static websites. Um, and, uh, and WordPress, uh, is not just a&lt;br /&gt;piece of software, right?&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a community of people that, uh, help to kind of raise the level of everyone who works on it.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and that, that&amp;#8217;s where I got my career jump off. It was, uh, it was definitely with WordPress&lt;br /&gt;for sure. That&amp;#8217;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Well, we met when you&amp;#8217;re part of Brute Protect and uh, I was asking in the pre-roll&lt;br /&gt;about your art in the background.&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of art. Yeah. I wanna get some from the walls, but tell me, tell me more about the&lt;br /&gt;art in the background cuz I was like, Hey, we met when you were part of Brute Protect before it&lt;br /&gt;was acquired by automatic. And you kind of pointed to the [00:02:00] lightning in the back. So,&lt;br /&gt;yeah, tell me more.&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: Yeah. So actually before we jump in here, this is an not an, uh, chronological&lt;br /&gt;order, but I was actually working for a company called Astonish, uh, where I actually got to build&lt;br /&gt;a, a, a large web team.&lt;br /&gt;I actually still work with one colleague from that company, Jeff Kalinsky. He works at Automatic&lt;br /&gt;now. Uh, when we were tasked with building, um, or converting a. source.net based cms, uh,&lt;br /&gt;from an old product called Blue Squid, uh, to a new WordPress powered multi-site. And it was&lt;br /&gt;gonna house like 4,000 sites.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and so we, I found this at like a art show. Uh, bought it, hung it on the wall, and uh, and we&lt;br /&gt;spent a year building this new platform. The funny thing about it, this is a really unique story.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&amp;#8217;t give us access to the source files. Uh, and they kind of held everything hostage. This third&lt;br /&gt;party company that we were host, host, hosting everything with.&lt;br /&gt;Um, so we actually had to build a, like a [00:03:00] w get scraper. To scrape our own websites&lt;br /&gt;and convert them into WordPress themes. So we didn&amp;#8217;t even like turn them into Ion out, we&lt;br /&gt;turned them into full blown WordPress themes on a multisite. And, uh, we were able to move all&lt;br /&gt;those sites over very quickly. Um, and so I asked that same artist, I said, Hey, can you paint a, a&lt;br /&gt;harpoon now that Blue Squid is dead?&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#8217;s this old product. And so we hung that up on the wall and that, and that was that. I left that&lt;br /&gt;company and co-founded Brew Protect. Uh, brew Protect was a cloud powered. Um, Uh, botnet&lt;br /&gt;prevention service. So like anyone who&amp;#8217;s trying to brute force into your website, we used, uh,&lt;br /&gt;data that we would gather from attack vectors from different various, uh, areas.&lt;br /&gt;And it was really the first time that I was able to say like, we&amp;#8217;re building something that leverages&lt;br /&gt;information that we gained from multiple hosting partnerships to better the entire WordPress&lt;br /&gt;community. Because everything that was happening before then was hosts would gather attack&lt;br /&gt;vectors against their own infrastructure, and that was the only thing they could [00:04:00] learn&lt;br /&gt;from.&lt;br /&gt;But what we did was we grabbed that information from across different hosting companies, uh,&lt;br /&gt;across customers who were around the globe, and we were able to really do a better job of&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;thwarting those attacks. Um, and so that represents cloud data raining down on a, a botnet, uh,&lt;br /&gt;going outta business there.&lt;br /&gt;And then, uh, yeah, and so then we got, uh, acquired by Automatic back in 2014, and I joined&lt;br /&gt;the Jet Pack team. Uh, I&amp;#8217;ve been working on hosting partnerships and. Product development for&lt;br /&gt;Jet Pack for almost nine years now. And, uh, then we started, uh, you know, launched WP Cloud&lt;br /&gt;last year.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: So it has been 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;Because I met you all right before the automatic acquisition. Acquisition. Yeah. Yeah. Um, man,&lt;br /&gt;well, some nostalgia there. Um, so what&amp;#8217;s, what&amp;#8217;s, uh, really compelling, what you just said too,&lt;br /&gt;is Jet. So when I knew you all got required and got got to meet you and Sam [00:05:00]&lt;br /&gt;Hotchkis, and then at some point I realized, Sam, and you were on the jet pack team and at Ithe&lt;br /&gt;we.&lt;br /&gt;Felt like we were competitors to Jet Pack in many ways, um, from backups and security. And I&lt;br /&gt;was like, oh no, these, these guys are gonna take jet pack to the next level. And I&amp;#8217;ve definitely&lt;br /&gt;seen, I think, what is probably the product of your work over the years where it&amp;#8217;s like, oh no.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, Sam, Jesse getting in there, um, with Jet Pack.&lt;br /&gt;So, uh, that&amp;#8217;s a, I wanted to mention that cuz I&amp;#8217;ve thought that many times. I think I&amp;#8217;ve expressed&lt;br /&gt;that to Sam. Um, but. Anyway, thanks for that background. That&amp;#8217;s, that&amp;#8217;s really compelling. Back&lt;br /&gt;to the old static h CML days. Woo. Thanks WordPress. Yeah. So Jesse, let&amp;#8217;s talk about WP&lt;br /&gt;Cloud. I know, um, we&amp;#8217;ve talked a couple times about this and I, what, I know I can throw this at&lt;br /&gt;you and you&amp;#8217;ll, you just, you just hit it out of the part and, uh, but tell me really succinctly, what&lt;br /&gt;do you [00:06:00] think? What is WP Cloud?.&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: WP Cloud is a WordPress focus cloud platform that we built within automatic&lt;br /&gt;to power the highest and most trafficked websites in the world. Um, and to provide a very unique&lt;br /&gt;solution, uh, that gets very close to, if not a hundred percent up time. Um, and so we&amp;#8217;re doing&lt;br /&gt;something that&amp;#8217;s a little bit different than what you see with other cloud platforms.&lt;br /&gt;We provide vertical scaling and automated real-time fail. So what we want to do is provide a&lt;br /&gt;solution that, again, is 100% WordPress focused, but allows you to stop thinking about hosting&lt;br /&gt;altogether. You don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about it anymore. We&amp;#8217;re gonna take care of all the&lt;br /&gt;infrastructure, keep it up and running, keep it high performance, and, uh, let hosting companies&lt;br /&gt;or others focus on what they do best, um, to provide a, a fantastic experience to customer.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Well, anytime you say something around wordpress.com infrastructure, I always&lt;br /&gt;go, holy [00:07:00] cow. Yeah. When you can say, pretty near, I know you&amp;#8217;re being humbled too,&lt;br /&gt;but like that, that system is renowned because it&amp;#8217;s incredible. I mean, people that work on, uh,&lt;br /&gt;the platform and what it does, but. Now, who&amp;#8217;s it? Who&amp;#8217;s it really for?&lt;br /&gt;When you think about WP Cloud, you kind of maybe mentioned this, but I wanna drill down on&lt;br /&gt;that. Who do you think it&amp;#8217;s really for?&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: Yeah. All right. So if we look at the actual, uh, hosting, uh, platform itself, it&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;for anyone who wants to have high availability, high performant websites. Uh, but if we look at&lt;br /&gt;the brand WP Cloud, what we&amp;#8217;ve done is we&amp;#8217;ve decided to take, um, the entire platform and, and&lt;br /&gt;give.&lt;br /&gt;A brand that we can then go to hosting companies with and, and provide services to hosting&lt;br /&gt;companies. So WP Cloud is not interested in individual customers, uh, small agencies, things&lt;br /&gt;like that. What we&amp;#8217;re actually interested in doing is providing services to hosting companies&lt;br /&gt;[00:08:00] to help them provide. Better hosting.&lt;br /&gt;Um, you can think about WP Cloud as a utility service, like the electrical grid underground, uh,&lt;br /&gt;providing services to customers all, all around the globe. But, um, allowing those hosting&lt;br /&gt;companies to, uh, maintain their experience, the things that differentiate themselves, all of. But if&lt;br /&gt;you&amp;#8217;re, if you&amp;#8217;re listening to this and you&amp;#8217;re thinking, oh, I have one website or 10 websites and I&lt;br /&gt;want to host them and I don&amp;#8217;t want to have to worry about, um, downtime or, or speed issues or&lt;br /&gt;anything like that, I would suggest going straight to one of WP Cloud&amp;#8217;s partners, pressable, for&lt;br /&gt;example.&lt;br /&gt;Mm-hmm.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: So when we were prepping for this, I said, Hey, so this, this pa uh, this is&lt;br /&gt;leveraging the.com platform, and you corrected me. Share a little bit more about that.&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: Yeah, sure. So, uh, so what we did was we took the minds and, and the&lt;br /&gt;people behind wordpress.com powering hundreds of millions of sites there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We took the [00:09:00] same, um, experienced individuals who were helping to power some of&lt;br /&gt;the, um, most powerful websites on v i p. Uh, we took the experience that we had from Running&lt;br /&gt;Pressable, which is, um, like a, uh, a managed WordPress host that we, uh, use to, um, really.&lt;br /&gt;Test and grow our own product base. And so we took all those things and we said, what, how&lt;br /&gt;can we build a cloud platform that&amp;#8217;s gonna service all of the needs that we have internally, um,&lt;br /&gt;and, and provide the absolute best experience?&lt;br /&gt;And so when we did that, we ended up launching, uh, what we called internally, uh, product&lt;br /&gt;called Atomic, uh, and that is now powering uh, wordpress.com business and e-commerce&lt;br /&gt;plans. Pressable News Pack. And so that was, uh, similar to like how a w s got born. You know,&lt;br /&gt;a, uh, Amazon was an e-commerce platform that was dealing with scale issues.&lt;br /&gt;They couldn&amp;#8217;t compensate for [00:10:00] the amount of the influx of traffic, so they had to really&lt;br /&gt;sit down and think about how they can rebuild their entire platform. Um, and so then that&amp;#8217;s how&lt;br /&gt;aw w s was born. It&amp;#8217;s not too dissimilar from what we&amp;#8217;re doing. We have built a platform that is&lt;br /&gt;now powering, um, 13 billion page views.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and, uh, with sites that are experiencing incredibly fast speed under load. Um, and, and&lt;br /&gt;now we&amp;#8217;re saying to ourselves like, well, we know we built something amazing here. We know&lt;br /&gt;that it&amp;#8217;s something that we can really give back to the community as a way to raise the bar for&lt;br /&gt;cloud hosting across, across the board.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and so now that, that is the, that is the effort there is we&amp;#8217;ve powered. Internally what we&lt;br /&gt;need to, to make sure that everything runs smoothly. So again, if anybody wants to try out WP&lt;br /&gt;Cloud, sign up for a wordpress.com business site, sign up for pressable. Um, you&amp;#8217;ll feel the&lt;br /&gt;speed, [00:11:00] uh, the proof is in, in the, uh, experience right there.&lt;br /&gt;Um, but then WP Cloud is really now focused on how it can provide services to hosting.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Yeah. I love that I&amp;#8217;ve observed from the industry being in as long as both of us have&lt;br /&gt;that, you know, there was this day where you started seeing some of the really big hosting&lt;br /&gt;companies start go moving. There WordPress stuff over to the cloud.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of bumpy roads along that way, but um, your comparison with aws for&lt;br /&gt;instance, cuz I&amp;#8217;ve heard Google Cloud, aws, some of those offerings kind of moving over and&lt;br /&gt;that&amp;#8217;s the way it feels like it&amp;#8217;s shifting. I&amp;#8217;m not a technical person, but I&amp;#8217;ve been in the space a&lt;br /&gt;long time and I go, it makes sense to have cloud-based hosting, especially for WordPress.&lt;br /&gt;And then you get specific WordPress expertise. That knows that application better than anybody&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#8217;d, I&amp;#8217;d, I&amp;#8217;d challenge anybody to say, do you know more about WordPress and automatic teams?&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. Um,&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: we definitely leveraged our, our own internal expertise to solve for that. And,&lt;br /&gt;and you&amp;#8217;re right. I [00:12:00] mean, you look at hosting companies and they&amp;#8217;re trying to figure&lt;br /&gt;out ways to differentiate themselves outside of the infrastructure.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of them are moving to Google Cloud or aw. Um, the shared hosting is still, you know,&lt;br /&gt;mostly the same kind of solution, um, that everyone is kind of racing to the bottom on pricing on.&lt;br /&gt;Mm-hmm. Um, and so, so how are hosts differentiating themselves? Well, it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s, you know, it&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;made on top of promises of speed and performance and, and security.&lt;br /&gt;But the reality of the situation is the, the infrastructure underneath is actually not. That different.&lt;br /&gt;So hosting companies are really focused on trying to differentiate themselves now in the way in&lt;br /&gt;which they market themselves. The onboarding experience that provide the partnerships that&lt;br /&gt;they can leverage to provide a better experience to customers.&lt;br /&gt;The speed at which you can launch your site, the customer service, those are all things that&lt;br /&gt;HUS hosting companies really f are, are focused on, and. Frankly, the places where they can,&lt;br /&gt;they can really win. One of the conversations I had at cloudfest, uh, which was a conference&lt;br /&gt;that we went to, um, [00:13:00] two weeks ago, was about the power of diversity within hosting.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and so I think that it&amp;#8217;s really important to recognize that, especially when we&amp;#8217;re talking about&lt;br /&gt;WP Cloud, helping to power those hosting companies in terms of like a utility. Um, you look at&lt;br /&gt;something like shop. And or, or w and they have these global solutions for every single, um,&lt;br /&gt;customer across the world.&lt;br /&gt;Um, but you know, we, we know why that&amp;#8217;s not, uh, advantageous and why WordPress is better.&lt;br /&gt;But one of the major advantages that WordPress has is that, um, the hosting companies can&lt;br /&gt;define the niche that they wanna solve. They can solve problems specific for geographically&lt;br /&gt;locations. WordPress has seeded itself into hosting companies around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So the solutions you get from a hosting company in let&amp;#8217;s say the Netherlands, is completely&lt;br /&gt;different than what you might get in Malaysia or Africa. Um, and so that&amp;#8217;s an advantage that that&lt;br /&gt;hosting companies have in that diversity. And so, uh, you know, if we can come [00:14:00] in&lt;br /&gt;and try to help and provide better services at that infrastructural, Then that frees those hosting&lt;br /&gt;companies up to think about ways in which they can differentiate themselves and provide the&lt;br /&gt;absolute best experience to those, to those customers.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Take care of wordPress, you got the power of WP Cloud, the.com top experience&lt;br /&gt;and do other stuff on top that adds value for your customers. Yeah, exactly. So. I know having&lt;br /&gt;been acquired, our company was acquired by hosting company, uh, been on the inside of that&lt;br /&gt;and realizing how much, you know, they, they really worry all, all hosting companies about price.&lt;br /&gt;Um, yeah. Anytime you, you know, c panel was this big conversation in the industry for a long&lt;br /&gt;time because they started cranking at prices and everybody started fleeing because they&amp;#8217;re like,&lt;br /&gt;they felt held hostage. But I know every penny accounts in hosting. So Can you talk a little bit&lt;br /&gt;about the pricing structure for WP.&lt;br /&gt;And I know that this is still early.&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: It is still early, and I [00:15:00] appreciate that and, uh, I probably shy away&lt;br /&gt;from getting into the super specifics of pricing right now, but what I can tell you is this, is that the&lt;br /&gt;way in which WP Cloud Scales is based on the number of pH p workers, uh, CPUs. Uh, and&lt;br /&gt;storage that you want.&lt;br /&gt;And so what we want to create are ways in which hosting companies can come in, um, and&lt;br /&gt;create bespoke offerings to either power their managed WordPress offering now, or to start by&lt;br /&gt;offering the higher tier hosting that they haven&amp;#8217;t been able to offer before. If you look at most of&lt;br /&gt;the hosting companies in the world, a lot of them cap out at a hundred bucks, 150 bucks a&lt;br /&gt;month.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and so then you leave, uh, the super high end. Hosting customers to, to either fend for&lt;br /&gt;themselves with their own cloud platform to go to, uh, you know, higher, higher end managed&lt;br /&gt;hosting. Um, or something like W P V I P. What we wanna do is be able to provide services that&lt;br /&gt;go from that range, from, uh, 25 bucks a month to [00:16:00] $2,000 a month, um, and to be&lt;br /&gt;able to provide consistent uptime throughout all of that.&lt;br /&gt;So hosting companies will be able to come in and use WP. Um, and, and if they want to go with&lt;br /&gt;a lower tier, like two PHP workers, two CPUs, this is getting super technical. That&amp;#8217;s still built for&lt;br /&gt;like 400,000 sustained visitors a month, uh, which is gonna compensate for, you know, most.&lt;br /&gt;Customers that&amp;#8217;s only gonna cost that hosting company a few bucks a month with WP Cloud.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and then, and then it scales up from there. And since we&amp;#8217;re talking about scaling, I&amp;#8217;ll, I&amp;#8217;ll, I&amp;#8217;ll&lt;br /&gt;just say one thing is, is that we offer something that&amp;#8217;s pretty unique in that we don&amp;#8217;t, uh, we don&amp;#8217;t&lt;br /&gt;reserve, uh, we, we don&amp;#8217;t have any limitations on visits. So if you take a look at other hosting&lt;br /&gt;companies, you&amp;#8217;ll see that they create, uh, they&amp;#8217;ll create really robust, powerful servers.&lt;br /&gt;And then they&amp;#8217;ll put traffic limits on it. Mm-hmm. I&amp;#8217;m thinking of a hosting company right now&lt;br /&gt;[00:17:00] that has, um, a robust amount of power, uh, allows for up to 40 WordPress websites&lt;br /&gt;and only, uh, and stops at like 400,000 visits a month. Mm-hmm. Well, if you only have 10,000&lt;br /&gt;visits a month, you don&amp;#8217;t need all that power anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Uh, even if you&amp;#8217;re not sharing it across all of those things, that&amp;#8217;s just a waste of power. That&amp;#8217;s a&lt;br /&gt;Lamborghini on the, on the back of a flatbed pickup truck. You know what I mean? Like you&amp;#8217;re&lt;br /&gt;not taking full advantage of that. WP Cloud is gonna come in and, and basically say, uh, we&amp;#8217;re&lt;br /&gt;going to create bespokes solutions that are designed to house the amount of traffic that you&amp;#8217;re,&lt;br /&gt;or serve the amount of traffic that you&amp;#8217;re bringing.&lt;br /&gt;Uh, but we&amp;#8217;re not gonna limit you on, on the amount of traffic that you have there. Um, so there&lt;br /&gt;are no real, uh, traffic limitations with WP Cloud, unlike other hosting companies.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Yeah, it, I don&amp;#8217;t know all the specs, but I know enough to go when they put a traffic&lt;br /&gt;thing, there&amp;#8217;s something underneath that they&amp;#8217;re trying to be careful of when they put limits and&lt;br /&gt;things.&lt;br /&gt;But, um, [00:18:00] so that, that&amp;#8217;s a conversation for another well, unless you.&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: Well, I was just gonna say that it&amp;#8217;s a way for them to mitigate their, their, their&lt;br /&gt;risk and their costs. Yeah. Um, but we, we have built a platform that we know can scale to any&lt;br /&gt;amount of traffic. So, uh, we&amp;#8217;re, we&amp;#8217;re gonna differentiate ourselves there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cory Miller: Yeah. Um, so I think you said fully managed performance security and WordPress.&lt;br /&gt;What does that mean?&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: It means that we&amp;#8217;re literally gonna take care of it all for you. So in terms of&lt;br /&gt;security, uh, it has built-in backup solutions. So it&amp;#8217;s actually pretty unique in the way in which we&lt;br /&gt;do backups. I&amp;#8217;m sure we&amp;#8217;re gonna touch on automated failovers soon.&lt;br /&gt;But the way we do our backups is that we do, um, daily file backups and hourly database&lt;br /&gt;backups, but we don&amp;#8217;t just store that on the same box. What we do is we put it onto another data&lt;br /&gt;center. On another box that actually has power ready so that we can switch to that if we need to.&lt;br /&gt;We can talk about that in a second.&lt;br /&gt;Um, but we [00:19:00] do, it comes with s ssl, it comes with, uh, TLS encryption. It comes with,&lt;br /&gt;uh, WAF DDoS protection. I&amp;#8217;m telling you. Like we harden the heck out of it. Yeah. Um, and then&lt;br /&gt;in, in addition to that, we automatically build in a c. No extra cost. It has a CDN built into it. Um,&lt;br /&gt;and it, uh, also resizes your images.&lt;br /&gt;So you&amp;#8217;re only serving the size of the image that you need high resolution, but you&amp;#8217;re not serving&lt;br /&gt;these 10 megabyte images that people upload straight from their phone to their WordPress&lt;br /&gt;instance, right? We&amp;#8217;re resizing it and only showing the size that you need for the device that&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;requesting it. Uh, we also do, uh, automated caching built in too.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and. It&amp;#8217;s all run by our team internally, so there is really no tweaking or configuring or&lt;br /&gt;anything that you have to do. Um, it&amp;#8217;s 100% fully managed outta the box. That also includes the&lt;br /&gt;management of things like P H p, uh, database. Um, it manages, uh, WordPress core [00:20:00]&lt;br /&gt;files, certain plug-ins. It allows for templating and staging.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and again, we handle all of that. It&amp;#8217;s not, these aren&amp;#8217;t things that you&amp;#8217;re gonna have to.&lt;br /&gt;Cherry pick based on price or anything. It&amp;#8217;s all 100% inclusive in the product.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: So I, you mentioned principle way earlier. I&amp;#8217;m a paying, and I wanna say that really&lt;br /&gt;loud and clear. I&amp;#8217;m a paying customer principle.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. So I&amp;#8217;ve seen this, the performance, all these things. And, uh, so that, that&amp;#8217;s, that&amp;#8217;s pretty&lt;br /&gt;awesome. But I, I wanted to push in on that because I&amp;#8217;m a, this is my comment, not. But when&lt;br /&gt;you say managed, you always, I always go, tell me what that really means. Yeah. Yeah. It&amp;#8217;s like,&lt;br /&gt;you know, the Tommy Boys, like you can slap a label on the side, but it&amp;#8217;s, you know, what&lt;br /&gt;actually happens inside.&lt;br /&gt;And I think that&amp;#8217;s one thing that differentiate, differentiates, uh, any automatic brand is it&amp;#8217;s not a&lt;br /&gt;label on the outside. Um, yeah. Okay. So tell me what automated realtime fellows.&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: So we touched on this briefly, right? [00:21:00] So if we, if we back up your&lt;br /&gt;entire site to another location and we put that back up on a box that has power, um, and you&amp;#8217;re&lt;br /&gt;serving traffic to one location, we can automatically detect some kind of, any kind of issue.&lt;br /&gt;So even if there was catastrophic failure, uh, you know, a pipe got cut. Uh, the data center&lt;br /&gt;actually you. We have tons of redundancies in terms of power and things like that, but like, let&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;just say like a volcano erupted or something like that, you know, something really catastrophic.&lt;br /&gt;We can in real time redirect that traffic to another data center that already has your site live on it&lt;br /&gt;and already has, uh, the, the power behind it.&lt;br /&gt;So we can in real time, switch that traffic and people will not experience any downtime. And that&lt;br /&gt;is something that is nearly impossible with other cloud platforms. It is possible, but it&amp;#8217;s incredibly&lt;br /&gt;expensive. And because of the scale that we operate at, uh, and the WordPress efficiency that&lt;br /&gt;we [00:22:00] have, um, we&amp;#8217;ve been able to, to build that into the platform.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: See, when you talked about backups earlier, it&amp;#8217;s something to know about having&lt;br /&gt;helped lead our product, uh, for backups. And when you said that one thing, it&amp;#8217;s not on that&lt;br /&gt;server. It&amp;#8217;s somewhere else within a vast infrastructure. That&amp;#8217;s really compelling to me because&lt;br /&gt;we would tell customers all the time, don&amp;#8217;t just don&amp;#8217;t back up on that server because what&amp;#8217;s,&lt;br /&gt;what&amp;#8217;s it gonna do for you when it crashes?&lt;br /&gt;Um, so like, I love the secure, the backup feature of that. It&amp;#8217;s not just a. A backup if something&lt;br /&gt;happens. And this was way before all this technology existed today, but that&amp;#8217;s how we got the&lt;br /&gt;backup is like into our product. Is it crashed? We didn&amp;#8217;t have, we had backups maybe on that&lt;br /&gt;server. And literally the hard drive was like capoot.&lt;br /&gt;And so that was our mantra. Always remote, offsite, you know, so that you can restore and. In&lt;br /&gt;case&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: we&amp;#8217;ve, we&amp;#8217;ve seen this, I, I&amp;#8217;ll [00:23:00] leave hosting companies names out of&lt;br /&gt;this, this conversation, but we&amp;#8217;ve all seen hosting companies that have had. Catastrophic failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, data center fires, for example, things like that.&lt;br /&gt;Uh, and if you&amp;#8217;re not backing up, this is getting into like a conversation about Jet Pack two, but&lt;br /&gt;like, if you&amp;#8217;re not backing up your, your website offsite, you&amp;#8217;re susceptible to that. Mm-hmm. Um,&lt;br /&gt;and that, that can be, um, unbelievably painful. I can&amp;#8217;t tell you how many conversations I had&lt;br /&gt;with people who say, well, I&amp;#8217;ll worry about security later, or I&amp;#8217;ll, I&amp;#8217;ll, you know, I don&amp;#8217;t really care&lt;br /&gt;about backups right now.&lt;br /&gt;I just wanna get my site. But all the time you&amp;#8217;re investing in that, right? You&amp;#8217;re building your&lt;br /&gt;website. Think about the dozens of hours of time that you&amp;#8217;re spending tweaking all those things.&lt;br /&gt;And if you lose that, it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s not just catastrophic failure for the host, it&amp;#8217;s catastrophic failure for&lt;br /&gt;the site owner too.&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s incredibly painful and to, you know, some, some people out there have stronger will than&lt;br /&gt;I to start all over from the beginning, but I don&amp;#8217;t, but that&amp;#8217;s, [00:24:00] sometimes I felt that pain&lt;br /&gt;you left with doing.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Yeah, I, I felt that. Yeah. Um, we were, we were scraping. We had some clients at&lt;br /&gt;the time and scraping data from Google Cash to redo websites, and so I felt that pain.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. So we&amp;#8217;ve talked about, um, the power, performance, security, all these things that are&lt;br /&gt;baked into WP Cloud, that powers.com business, eCommerce plans. But how about the,&lt;br /&gt;Preserving and growing the hosting experience. What are your thoughts on that? So key, key&lt;br /&gt;client for this is our hosting companies, um, to be able to really leverage all of this for, I mean,&lt;br /&gt;when you said utility tool, it really rang a bell for me.&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#8217;s like, okay, all of this at a re, very. Reasonable price, and I know they need to talk to you&lt;br /&gt;about all those things. But yeah, let&amp;#8217;s, let&amp;#8217;s talk about that hosting experience a little bit. Tell me,&lt;br /&gt;tell me your thoughts on that related to WP Club.&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: So every single [00:25:00] host that, and I&amp;#8217;ve worked with a lot of hosting&lt;br /&gt;companies, every single host has a unique experience.&lt;br /&gt;Uh, the signup flow is typically about the same, but the second that you get into that WordPress&lt;br /&gt;instance being launched, Unique onboarding flows. You get unique sets of tools. Um, the&lt;br /&gt;different combinations of the way in which they combine, uh, partnerships they have with&lt;br /&gt;security or performance companies.&lt;br /&gt;Um, And then the platform, the platform is always really unique. Um, a lot of them are built on&lt;br /&gt;top of cPanel or Plak. I think something like 70, 80% of all hosts use that technology. Mm-hmm.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and sometimes you feel it and sometimes you don&amp;#8217;t. Like, there are certain hosting&lt;br /&gt;companies that are just using cPanel.&lt;br /&gt;It literally says cPanel and you, and you know what you&amp;#8217;re on. But then there are other hosting&lt;br /&gt;companies that have built a completely custom bespoke solution that&amp;#8217;s layered on top of. No&lt;br /&gt;matter what it is, um, that, that again is how you&amp;#8217;re differentiating yourself. Um, so if I look at six&lt;br /&gt;hosting companies that are using the same [00:26:00] basic boxes to do shared WordPress&lt;br /&gt;hosting, they&amp;#8217;re the only difference.&lt;br /&gt;There is price, but we&amp;#8217;re all. All hosting companies are racing to the bottom on price, and we&amp;#8217;re,&lt;br /&gt;we&amp;#8217;re talking about a difference of a few bucks a month. Um, so then what is it that you get with&lt;br /&gt;that hosting that&amp;#8217;s really gonna differentiate &amp;#8217;em? And so most people are either making&lt;br /&gt;decisions based on the fact that they have a recommendation from a friend, or they&amp;#8217;re taking a&lt;br /&gt;look at, uh, you know, the, the, the bespoke solutions that are coming bundled with that.&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about WP Cloud is that it has no platform. It has no user interface. It is 100%&lt;br /&gt;API driven. So for any hosting company to use it, it has to work underneath every single thing&lt;br /&gt;that they&amp;#8217;ve already built. Um, and so it can work with C Panel, it can work with Plesk, uh, or it&lt;br /&gt;can work with whatever bespoke solution you have.&lt;br /&gt;Um, but your, um, Unveiling of the use of WP Cloud is up to you as a host and company. You&lt;br /&gt;[00:27:00] can go one way and say, Similar to, I think like WP Engine does this with like a w s or&lt;br /&gt;Google Cloud. They say like, you know, proudly like we&amp;#8217;re partnered with this company to, to&lt;br /&gt;launch this. Um, and the same way that Pressable does this with like WP Cloud or Grid Pain,&lt;br /&gt;uh, you know, they say proudly powered by WP Cloud.&lt;br /&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s starting to mean something as we start to have more of these conversations and&lt;br /&gt;more people understand what WP Cloud really is. But, um, WP Cloud also offers a completely.&lt;br /&gt;Uh, an option that allows you to basically use our infrastructure without ever mentioning us. You&lt;br /&gt;could even bring your own IP addresses if you wanted to, um, and then take use of the entire&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;infrastructure underneath it, uh, without having to disclose that it&amp;#8217;s not something that&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;homegrown.&lt;br /&gt;Um, so however the host and company wants to work in that, in that area makes sense to us.&lt;br /&gt;Uh, what we want to do is just really. Allow them to refocus their efforts away from things like&lt;br /&gt;[00:28:00] managing WordPress or handling security or dealing with uptime. The other thing I&amp;#8217;ll&lt;br /&gt;talk about too is, um, cost to serve.&lt;br /&gt;Cost to serve is something that&amp;#8217;s on the mind of every single hosting company. Uh, when&lt;br /&gt;Pressable moved onto WP Cloud, we saw a dramatic decrease in, um, support tickets related to&lt;br /&gt;anything infrastructure rate, limiting DDoS, anything like. Um, and the same thing with&lt;br /&gt;wordpress.com, uh, wordpress.com business and e-commerce customers.&lt;br /&gt;They&amp;#8217;re not, uh, reaching out and asking for support on anything related to the box or how fast&lt;br /&gt;their site is performing. What they are asking questions about is more things around how can&lt;br /&gt;they be successful. How can you know what plugins should I use for this? Or, or that that&amp;#8217;s your&lt;br /&gt;decision as a host and company decide pr provide support in that area or not.&lt;br /&gt;But I can tell you that when you relieve your host, your, your happiness engineers, your&lt;br /&gt;customer service team, from the burden of having to figure out why a site is down or why it&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;[00:29:00] performing so slowly, it gives them the ability. You know, focus on what keeps those&lt;br /&gt;customers there for the long term, reducing churn, which is what every host and company thinks&lt;br /&gt;about.&lt;br /&gt;Pressable had something like 36,000 tickets last year. Less than half of a percentage of them&lt;br /&gt;were even associated with anything, uh, related to to infrastructure. And I even read some of&lt;br /&gt;them. And a lot of them were just questions about how, how Pressable goes about handling.&lt;br /&gt;Um, so we&amp;#8217;ve basically eliminated support for, for hosting.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: That&amp;#8217;s the headline right there for, for WordPress hosting that, that&amp;#8217;s the headline of&lt;br /&gt;the interview today. For sure. Well, um, Jesse, we&amp;#8217;ve covered a lot, but I wanna make sure we&lt;br /&gt;didn&amp;#8217;t miss anything. Um, I think it&amp;#8217;s an incredibly compelling service. Could help really raise the&lt;br /&gt;standard of the hosting industry for WordPress.&lt;br /&gt;Um, that&amp;#8217;s exactly. So what, uh, [00:30:00] and, and this is the note I wanted to say about the&lt;br /&gt;hosting experiences like that, uh, I think that frees a hosting company to also innovate on that&lt;br /&gt;application labor. What things, whether it&amp;#8217;s plugins, themes, services on top that add value for&lt;br /&gt;who their customers are and what they&amp;#8217;re trying to get.&lt;br /&gt;And I think that&amp;#8217;s, that&amp;#8217;s pretty dang cool. If I were in that seat hosting product, uh, manager, I&amp;#8217;d&lt;br /&gt;be like, okay, this is taken care of. It&amp;#8217;s base lever, le level here. Now how can we set ourselves&lt;br /&gt;apart by adding value to who our customers are? But is there anything with that, um, we left at,&lt;br /&gt;or you wanna mention?&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: Well, I&amp;#8217;ll actually just pick up right there where you, uh, you mentioned about,&lt;br /&gt;uh, hosting companies. I think one thing to remember is, is that, Our mission at Automatic more&lt;br /&gt;than anything is to provide, um, and democratize publishing. We know that, but it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s also&lt;br /&gt;about making sure that WordPress is not only [00:31:00] readily available, but performing at a&lt;br /&gt;level that, um, allows you to focus on getting the word out about your business or your political&lt;br /&gt;views or whatever it might be.&lt;br /&gt;Um, but hosting companies, uh, are experiencing incredible churn right now. Uh, we. This was&lt;br /&gt;like the number one topic at that conference I mentioned earlier. Cloud Fest, um, hosting&lt;br /&gt;companies are seeing extreme churn, and the problem is, is that when someone churns from a&lt;br /&gt;hosting company that is specifically for WordPress, they don&amp;#8217;t churn and go, they don&amp;#8217;t try&lt;br /&gt;hosting company a.&lt;br /&gt;Say, oh, my WordPress experience wasn&amp;#8217;t so great there. I&amp;#8217;m gonna go try hosting company B&lt;br /&gt;and try WordPress there, and then I&amp;#8217;m gonna try hosting company C and try WordPress there.&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#8217;s not really What happens is that they give WordPress a shot on whatever hosting&lt;br /&gt;company they&amp;#8217;ve chosen. And if that fails, uh, or that doesn&amp;#8217;t work out for them, a lot of them&lt;br /&gt;end up going to something else.&lt;br /&gt;And so that one opportunity to provide a [00:32:00] superior WordPress experience is really&lt;br /&gt;where we want to help, right? So if we can take care of the, the infrastructure, the hosting, the&lt;br /&gt;security, the performance, and make sure that everyone has this like level set, amazing hosting&lt;br /&gt;experience in terms of the infrastructure.&lt;br /&gt;I wanna touch on the exact, like, I wanna reiterate what you just said, which is that that allows&lt;br /&gt;hosting companies to innovate on what they can do to provide better onboarding, reduce time to&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;live, which is how fast they can launch their site, helping to make sure customers are&lt;br /&gt;successful, focus your time on marketing so that customers sites, once they&amp;#8217;re launched, they&lt;br /&gt;can actually gain traffic and, and really help them to achieve their business goals.&lt;br /&gt;And the other thing that I just wanted to touch on real quick too is, is just, uh, we talked a little bit&lt;br /&gt;about scaling, but one of the things I do wanna mention is, is that, um, so these are bare metal&lt;br /&gt;boxes that we built up that we own. They&amp;#8217;re, we&amp;#8217;re not outsourcing anything at all. Um, and we&lt;br /&gt;have 28 data centers around the globe already that are ours, uh, powering this entire&lt;br /&gt;infrastructure.&lt;br /&gt;[00:33:00] Um, and then, uh, when someone. Hit with traffic, an extreme amount of traffic. What&lt;br /&gt;typically happens with other, um, cloud platforms is that they replicate everything onto a&lt;br /&gt;separate box and they try to throw additional boxes at the problem. But the problem is that if&lt;br /&gt;you&amp;#8217;re down, because you can&amp;#8217;t service the amount of traffic that you&amp;#8217;re handling, you have to&lt;br /&gt;wait for that extra box to spool up, or you&amp;#8217;re paying for it to be laying in weight.&lt;br /&gt;Right. What we can do actually is what we do is vertical scaling. So we have the option to throw&lt;br /&gt;more PHPs and more CPUs at the problem until we&amp;#8217;ve compensated for the amount of traffic&lt;br /&gt;that you have. But this is where things get really unique. We go when we build out hosting&lt;br /&gt;plans. As I said before, hosts can build plans between two and say 30 PHP workers and CPUs.&lt;br /&gt;That&amp;#8217;s built for sustained traffic of 400,000 visits to 15 million visits. Um, but now let&amp;#8217;s say you&lt;br /&gt;have an e-commerce website that got featured on the wire cutter, or you have, uh, a product&lt;br /&gt;that you&amp;#8217;ve been [00:34:00] ready to release and you have a huge wait list, uh, and everyone&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;gonna slam your site at the same exact time.&lt;br /&gt;WP Cloud has a very unique opportunity that we can burst to 110 PhD P workers in CPUs. And&lt;br /&gt;then what we&amp;#8217;re talking about then is, is handling the type of traffic that like the Washington Post&lt;br /&gt;gets when they release an article about what&amp;#8217;s happening in our, in our government, or. C n n&lt;br /&gt;traffic, you know what I mean?&lt;br /&gt;Mm-hmm. Um, and so those, those are the types of things that we&amp;#8217;re, we&amp;#8217;re mainly focused on&lt;br /&gt;so that we can provide, you know, v i p level hosting, um, and allow hosting companies to break&lt;br /&gt;out of that shared hosting and the cheaper managed hosting, and to really offer something to,&lt;br /&gt;you know, to any of those customers that are, that are experiencing incredibly high.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: I wanna go back to something you said because I absolutely, it rings true with me,&lt;br /&gt;is that if the hosting experience is not good, particularly on the WordPress as an application&lt;br /&gt;layer, [00:35:00] um, yeah, we&amp;#8217;re, we&amp;#8217;re not, we&amp;#8217;re doing a disservice to the entire industry&lt;br /&gt;because we&amp;#8217;re. Turning a WordPress person into another Com competitor.&lt;br /&gt;And you know, I&amp;#8217;ve been in this space a long time and I go, you know, I woke up a year ago and&lt;br /&gt;go, wow, there&amp;#8217;s very solid competitors to WordPress now out there. And if we want to, as the&lt;br /&gt;business eco ecosystem of WordPress continued to have this incredible thriving grow.&lt;br /&gt;Ecosystem and the software. Then we, you know, we used to say like, you need two things.&lt;br /&gt;You need a domain name and you need WordPress hosting to Yep. To buy our products. And&lt;br /&gt;then again to those agencies out there who we serve, um, at post tennis and are building on&lt;br /&gt;that, that love, that inflow and growth that we&amp;#8217;ve all enjoyed with the growth of WordPress, then&lt;br /&gt;we need to be serious about this conversation in the hosting experience because, You hit it right&lt;br /&gt;on the nail.&lt;br /&gt;They&amp;#8217;re not leaving the hosting [00:36:00] company. Just the hosting company. They&amp;#8217;re leaving&lt;br /&gt;potentially WordPress. And that&amp;#8217;s the bell I want to keep ringing, is that as an industry, we need&lt;br /&gt;to do things like this. This is, this is a key pillar. I think. Um, there&amp;#8217;s other things that we need to&lt;br /&gt;be doing as a WordPress business ecosystem to keep this healthy, thriving, growing.&lt;br /&gt;And, uh, I&amp;#8217;m glad you mentioned that because it&amp;#8217;s something I&amp;#8217;ve seen, um, too, but that just&lt;br /&gt;gives a real world experience of like, if these hosting companies are having churn, it&amp;#8217;s not just&lt;br /&gt;them, it&amp;#8217;s all of us. And there, there&amp;#8217;s a brand that we&amp;#8217;ve had with WordPress that has been&lt;br /&gt;awesome and I&amp;#8217;m incredibly grateful for the brand and the open source software.&lt;br /&gt;So I appreciate you mentioning that .&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: Yeah, of course. Yeah. If you remember the old days of the five minute install,&lt;br /&gt;um, I do. That was basically, uh, yeah. And for anyone who&amp;#8217;s listening, who, who may not be&lt;br /&gt;familiar with that, cuz it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s been enough years now. Uh, when you used to get a, [00:37:00] a,&lt;br /&gt;a new hosting account, it never really came pre-built with WordPress, uh, out of the box, you&amp;#8217;d&lt;br /&gt;have to.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Download WordPress from wordpress.org, re-upload it, sftp, build a database. Um, and then the&lt;br /&gt;five minute install came out and it was like this brilliant way of like launching a WordPress&lt;br /&gt;website super fast. And that was the moment I think that husband companies decided like, wait&lt;br /&gt;a minute, we can actually like really create custom WordPress experiences.&lt;br /&gt;Because it&amp;#8217;s no longer in charge of the customer to actually launch a WordPress website. It&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;now up to the, the host to actually launch that instance. And that&amp;#8217;s when they started packaging&lt;br /&gt;their own plugins, their own themes into it, providing their own unique solutions. And that&amp;#8217;s all&lt;br /&gt;well and good. Um, but I think there is a responsibility to those hosts, to the larger ecosystem to&lt;br /&gt;make sure that we&amp;#8217;re, we&amp;#8217;re furthering the mission across the board.&lt;br /&gt;Um, and so their churn is definitely a reflection of the larger ecosystems. Hundred percent.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: I mean, that affects all of our members that post us from product companies,&lt;br /&gt;[00:38:00] professionals that do WordPress love, being able to do pre WordPress as their career&lt;br /&gt;and the agency serving their clients out. Across the world.&lt;br /&gt;So a hundred percent agree. And this, this is something we&amp;#8217;ll have to change the headline a little&lt;br /&gt;bit and add to it because it&amp;#8217;s my personal viewpoint that we need to, all of us collectively look at&lt;br /&gt;the industry and go, what makes it healthier for everybody? And this is a, this is part of the&lt;br /&gt;conversation, so it matters, this conversation today, even if they don&amp;#8217;t choose to go with WP&lt;br /&gt;Cloud, that we need to be thinking about this experience for the overall health of, of the industry.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. Absolut. For sure, Jesse, my friend. Um, so if somebody&amp;#8217;s interested and wants to talk&lt;br /&gt;more about W Cloud, what do they do?&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: So if you&amp;#8217;re a hosting company and uh, you wanna partner with WP Cloud, go&lt;br /&gt;to wp.cloud. Uh, it&amp;#8217;ll load so fast, you think it&amp;#8217;s a local site. Uh, so that&amp;#8217;ll be your first taste of the&lt;br /&gt;power of WP Cloud.&lt;br /&gt;Uh, funny [00:39:00] enough, that site is actually hosted by Pressable on just a regular account.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special. Um, so, uh, you&amp;#8217;ll see, you&amp;#8217;ll see how that works if you&amp;#8217;re thinking. Moving your&lt;br /&gt;own personal sites or your businesses sites, um, and you&amp;#8217;re not a hosting company, but you&lt;br /&gt;want to, you want to try out WP Cloud, take a look at our partners.&lt;br /&gt;So we have, uh, wordpress.com Pressable, uh, if you&amp;#8217;re a news site, you could try News Pack&lt;br /&gt;Grid Pain now offers, um, uh, WP Cloud as well. And, uh, and uh, yeah, we have some other&lt;br /&gt;partners coming down the pike too. Uh, that will be, uh, will be.&lt;br /&gt;Cory Miller: Let me know when the new&lt;br /&gt;partners come in. We wanna share that, um, to, to our members at Postes.&lt;br /&gt;But Jesse, thanks. Sure. Uh, for this today. I appreciate your time sharing about what you&amp;#8217;re&lt;br /&gt;doing at WP Cloud and Automatic. Um, so thank you and everybody else. Thank you for&lt;br /&gt;listening in to another post status draft episode I, the product People series.&lt;br /&gt;Jesse Friedman: Yeah. Well, thank you for having me.

	<title>WPTavern: WooCommerce Launches Woo Express</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=143718</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-launches-woo-express</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WooCommerce has launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://woocommerce.com/express/&quot;&gt;Woo Express&lt;/a&gt;, a new managed hosting product that uses WordPress.com&amp;#8217;s infrastructure and relieves store owners of the responsibilities of hosting and maintenance. The company soft-launched Woo Express in early March with a small selection of visitors but has concluded that phase and opened it up to the public.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Woo Express provides a selection of extensions already installed and professionally-designed themes but is built with the same open source platform that allows store owners to install any plugin or theme. Merchants can use WooCommerce Payments or any other payment gateway they choose. The plans also include automated backups, security scanning, and a custom domain and SSL certificate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At WooSesh in October 2022, the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/hosted-woocommerce-solution-coming-to-wordpress-com-in-2023-following-recent-launches-from-godaddy-and-bluehost&quot;&gt;announced it was working on a hosted WooCommerce solution&lt;/a&gt; just as GoDaddy had launched an open access preview ofÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.godaddy.com/hosting/ecommerce-hosting&quot;&gt;Managed WooCommerce Stores&lt;/a&gt;Â toÂ US-based customers, and Bluehost launched its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bluehost.com/wordpress/woocommerce-hosting&quot;&gt;WooCommerce offering&lt;/a&gt; a month prior.  The drive to provide a more customized, user-friendly onboarding experience beyond simply having WooCommerce pre-installed, is getting more competitive. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pricing for Woo Express&amp;#8217; hosting plans comes in slightly more expensive than GoDaddy&amp;#8217;s introductory $20.99/mo pricing (renews at $29.99/mo) for the most basic plan, but cheaper than GoDaddy&amp;#8217;s mid-tier and upper-tier plans which start at&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;$99.99/mo and $149.99/mo. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bluehost sits at the budget end of the WooCommerce hosting spectrum with plans starting at $9.95/mo (renews at $24.95/mo) and an upper end plan at $12.95/mo (renews at $39.95) that adds the ability to manage product inventory across Etsy, Amazon, and eBay from a consolidated dashboard via Ecomdash.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img /&gt;Woo Express pricing on 4/19/2023



&lt;p&gt;Comparing plans across managed WooCommerce hosts isn&amp;#8217;t straightforward as they all offer different features for a variety of stores at different pricing tiers. One major differentiator is the extensions bundled with the plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although WooCommerce may be late to the game in offering a managed hosting solution, the makers of the e-commerce software have a clear advantage with their position in the WooCommerce ecosystem and a marketplace of more than 800 products. Woo Express has launched with a compelling set of commercial &lt;a href=&quot;https://woocommerce.com/document/woo-express/#section-4&quot;&gt;extensions bundled into the hosting plans&lt;/a&gt;, including product add-ons, product bundles, gift cards, min/max quantities, back in stock notifications, brands, product recommendations, subscriptions, in-person payments, shipment tracking,Â and more. Storeowners who were to purchase all of these extensions individually would spend far more than the annual cost of Woo Express hosting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;Woo Express Goes All-In on Block-Based Stores&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WooCommerce is still working through the process of &amp;#8220;blockifying&amp;#8221; all aspects of store templates, and Woo Express is ready to carry the standard with a block theme as the default when customers sign up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;One of our goals for Woo Express is to give new merchants the best of everything WordPress offers â the site editor and the blocks we&amp;#8217;ve built for WooCommerce mean you can create a beautiful site to express your brand without coding knowledge,&amp;#8221; WooCommerce COO Warren Holmes said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Woo Express ships with &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/theme/tsubaki&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tsubaki&lt;/a&gt; as the default, a modern, commerce-focused, block-based theme. We&amp;#8217;ve made it easier for new merchants to get started with this theme by creating default content powered by our blocks. That includes the new &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://woocommerce.com/checkout-blocks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cart and checkout blocks&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a more delightful experience for shoppers and better conversions for merchants.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few other commercial themes Automattic designed for Woo Express include &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/theme/amulet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amulet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/theme/zaino&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zaino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/theme/tazza&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tazza&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/theme/thriving-artist&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thriving Artist&lt;/a&gt;. Store owners are also free to install any theme from the wide world of WooCommerce themes, not just the ones included in the hosting plan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Woo Express has a 14-day free trial so prospective hosting customers can try out the bundled extensions, themes, and the environment to see if it will fit their needs. The onboarding experience was designed to be friendly for merchants but developers still have access to everything under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;With every managed WordPress.com environment, you get access to a native GitHub integration, you can run WP-CLI commands, check server logs, access to DBs directly and set up your workflows through SSH and SFTP, and much more,&amp;#8221; WooCommerce developer advocate Stephanie Pi said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/04/17/a-developers-look-at-woo-express/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; outlining the new product on the company&amp;#8217;s Developer blog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As WooCommerce has become the most used open source e-commerce software, powering &lt;a href=&quot;https://trends.builtwith.com/shop/&quot;&gt;23% of the top million online stores&lt;/a&gt;, managed hosting products have the potential to drive this growth even further. Users have an expectation that things will just work, but the reality is that much of WooCommerce&amp;#8217;s open source ecosystem has grown up like wildflowers in a field. There are many great solutions out there but they don&amp;#8217;t all work harmoniously together, which can drive people to proprietary, turnkey e-commerce solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On a recent &lt;a href=&quot;ttps://dothewoo.io/woo-express-with-beau-lebens/&quot;&gt;Do the Woo podcast episode&lt;/a&gt;, WooCommerce Head of Engineering Beau Lebens discussed how curated solutions like Woo Express bring some uniformity to the WooCommerce ecosystem. Putting a bunch of disparate solutions together hasn&amp;#8217;t always provided the best experience for merchants, and it introduces complexity that can drive users away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WooCommerce announced its intention to collaborate with hosting partners in October 2022 with WordPress.com as the first to pilot the new managed hosting solution. At that time Lebens said &amp;#8220;details like different versions and white-labeling are still under consideration&amp;#8221; but WooCommerce is interested in making customization available to suit the specific needs of hosts and their customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Holmes said his team is also currently in the process of evaluating an affiliate program to enable developers and the broader community to spread the word about Woo Express. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When asked about the status of other hosting partners offering Woo Express on their own infrastructure, Holmes said WooCommerce is still evaluating the possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Many merchants experience WooCommerce with the help of one of hundreds of amazing independent WordPress / Woo hosts around the world, and we regard that as an indispensable part of Wooâs success and place in the e-commerce landscape,&amp;#8221; Holmes said. &amp;#8220;Weâre hard at work on a way to expand our collaboration with hosts in the future through Woo Express. At the moment we donât have anything specific to announce, but we do currently have multiple teams looking into this.&amp;#8221;Â &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Launching a managed hosting product puts WooCommerce in a unique position to tailor the core software to better serve the needs of store owners and hosting partners that are furthering its adoption, benefiting all who are using WooCommerce and building products for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re very much using this as a way to drive improvements on the merchant experience in WooCommerce Core,&amp;#8221; Lebens said on the Do the Woo podcast. &amp;#8220;So that will be available to everyone, including all other hosts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But it also means that, as a package, we can start to say, because we do partner with other hosts, we work with them very directly, and we can say, &amp;#8216;Hey, look, this stuff works better.&amp;#8217; If you bundle all of this together, if you offer this with a free trial, if you keep your pricing in this range, whatever it is, the learnings that we have from doing this ourselves, absolutely we intend to share this with hosts and work with other hosts to implement this for the whole ecosystem.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: #72 â Steve Bruner and Timothy Jacobs on Using Gutenberg Outside of WordPress</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&amp;p=143647</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/podcast/72-steve-bruner-and-timothy-jacobs-on-using-gutenberg-outside-of-wordpress</link>
	<description>Transcript&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:00] Nathan Wrigley: Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case using Gutenberg to build the Engine Awesome SaaS app.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcasts players.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you have a topic that you&amp;#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&amp;#8217;m very keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you all your idea featured on the show had to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So on the podcast today we have Steve Bruner and Timothy Jacobs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Steve has been active in the WordPress community for the past 17 years. He&amp;#8217;s a WordPress developer, co organizer of the WordPress NYC meetup, and has organized many word camps in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Timothy is a WordPress core committer for the REST API, and has been a WordPress developer for over 10 years. At StellarWP he leads development of the iThemes security plugin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What brings them together is that they&amp;#8217;re both founders of a SaaS app called Engine Awesome, where Steve is the CEO, and Timothy is the CTO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What has this got to do with WordPress, you might ask? Well, they&amp;#8217;re here today to talk about Gutenberg, but not how you might expect. It&amp;#8217;s Gutenberg outside of WordPress, but Gutenberg, nonetheless. Like all of WordPress, Gutenberg is open source. You are free to download it, modify it and use it in whatever way you like.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Steve and Timothy began working on their new project and needed a way for their clients to interact with it, they found Gutenberg was the perfect tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We talk about what benefits they&amp;#8217;ve gained by using Gutenberg. How it saved them time, and how it&amp;#8217;s fast becoming a stable and mature product which is easy for non-technical users to understand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We get into the details of which parts of Gutenberg they used, and which parts were not suitable for their app. They&amp;#8217;ve been building their own blocks, which work well in the UI, but which are more suited to the kinds of data that they&amp;#8217;re gathering.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discussion then moves on to what Engine Awesome actually does. It&amp;#8217;s an app builder in which you can construct your own data containers and theme them so that it displays in any way you like. They tell us about the features, which they have so far, as well as the items which are on their roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Towards the end we talk about their commitment to continue contributing back to the Gutenberg project, and how they feel that it&amp;#8217;s in everyone&amp;#8217;s interest if the project gets better from any updates that they have made.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re looking to build your own SaaS app, or you&amp;#8217;re just curious about how Gutenberg is being deployed outside of WordPress, this podcast is for you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&amp;#8217;ll find the other episodes as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so without further delay, I bring you Steve Bruner and Timothy Jacobs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am joined on the podcast today by two gentlemen. I&amp;#8217;m joined by Steve Bruner and Timothy Jacobs. Hello.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:04:23] Steve Bruner: Hey Nathan. Nice to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:04:24] Timothy Jacobs: Hey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:04:25] Nathan Wrigley: Steve. Firstly, did I pronounce your surname correctly?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:04:29] Steve Bruner: You did absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:04:30] Nathan Wrigley: First try. Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s great. Well, thank you for joining us on the podcast today. We&amp;#8217;re going to be talking about something which we literally haven&amp;#8217;t covered in any way, shape, or form at all. We&amp;#8217;ve talked endlessly about Gutenberg and the Block Editor, and blocks and patterns and all of that. But we&amp;#8217;re kind of staying away from that, despite the fact we&amp;#8217;re going to be talking about Gutenberg. Because we&amp;#8217;re going to be talking about an app which has been built on top of Gutenberg, but really not that connected to WordPress. So buckle up. This will be an interesting episode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We like to orientate the listeners as to who you are so that when they&amp;#8217;re listening, they know that you are an authority on what you&amp;#8217;re talking about. So can I take you in turn? Can I go Steve, first? Would you mind giving us your little potted history of who you are, what you do for a living, where you live, and what your relationship has been with WordPress?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:05:18] Steve Bruner: Sure. So back in my previous life I was in like marketing and sales. I embraced technology back then and using spreadsheets and eventually Microsoft Access, I was able to do more than anyone else on my team, right? I could do 10, 20 times the amount of work, just writing macros in Excel or, do database config in Microsoft Access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I loved playing with technology and started playing with HTML, and a friend of mine about 17 years ago, 18 years ago, introduced me to WordPress, said, this is pretty cool, you may want to check it out. And I really loved it. It was easy and it was hackable and it was a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually somebody asked me to build them a website. Somebody else offered to pay me to build them a website. And that just grew over the years until I became a full-time, I guess, solopreneur. I have an agency, but I do hire out contractors on a regular basis. I have relationships with many contractors who I&amp;#8217;ve been using now for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also ended up back then taking over the WordPress meetup in New York City. It was about 400 members, now it&amp;#8217;s 9,000. That really gave me a good introduction to WordPress. It introduced me to a lot of people, and I learned. In the very beginning of a meetup, for those of you who are trying to start one, if you don&amp;#8217;t have somebody who will present, you are the presenter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So for the first year, year and a half, I presented every month, third Tuesday of the month. Did that for a year and a half until we started getting more presenters in. So that grew and yeah, I&amp;#8217;m a full-time WordPress developer now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:06:56] Nathan Wrigley: Isn&amp;#8217;t it curious how, if you have been using the internet, let&amp;#8217;s say, and building websites for anything like 20, 30 plus years, you kind of more or less fell into this job. I&amp;#8217;ve yet to come across anybody of my age, shall we say, who&amp;#8217;s been doing this for that length of time who sort of decided from the outset, that&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;m going to do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The story is always the same. I was doing something else and then I discovered HTML and played with CSS and realized, oh, I could actually make a living with this. What fun.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:07:23] Steve Bruner: That&amp;#8217;s exactly right. The fact that WordPress is open source. You can run it locally. I learned how to code, and this is not an uncommon story, right? I learned how to code by changing code in WordPress. By commenting things out and changing things, and just seeing how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:07:39] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. A verified tinkerer. It sounds like a man after my own heart. Okay, so let&amp;#8217;s move on to Timothy. Timothy, same question really. Give us your background story and particularly your relationship with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:07:52] Timothy Jacobs: For sure. I&amp;#8217;m also based in the New York City area, so you can guess how I met Steve at the WordPress New York City Meetup Group, which I also help co-organize. But aside from that I&amp;#8217;ve been working with WordPress now for about ish 10 years or so. My day job is I work over at StellarWP on iThemes security. So I&amp;#8217;m the lead developer over there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But I also have yeah been involved with the WordPress community for a bit. I&amp;#8217;m right now a WordPress core committer. I help work with the REST API in WordPress Core. And then also try and, you know, work with the Gutenberg team as well on REST API things and bringing the two together and helping everything work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:08:29] Nathan Wrigley: Well thank you. At the outset of this podcast it might be useful if you are listening to this and you&amp;#8217;re anywhere near a computer. Just pause for a moment and go to the URL engineawesome.com. It is exactly as you&amp;#8217;d imagine. There&amp;#8217;s no funky spelling there, engineawesome.com.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Go and have a poke around because I feel that the context that you&amp;#8217;ll get from doing that will put you in a good position to enjoy this podcast episode more. So come back and we&amp;#8217;ll get on with the ride. So first of all, whoever wants to answer the question, what is Engine Awesome? We should probably clear that up straight away.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:09:03] Steve Bruner: Great. So yeah, I can answer that. Engine Awesome is a SaaS application, and for those interested it is built using Gutenberg, but Gutenberg using Laravel, not WordPress. But it&amp;#8217;s a SaaS application that allows you to build applications for your business with absolutely no code, just using blocks. You could build your own CRM. You can build an order management system, a donation system, project tracking, to-dos. Anything you want in the config that you need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:09:33] Nathan Wrigley: So the ability to do that in SaaS software, there&amp;#8217;s probably a multitude of apps that we could go to that offer, I guess, something fairly similar. You know a no code tool which allows you to build something custom. But the unique bit which has got you on this podcast today is the fact that you&amp;#8217;ve chosen to do that outside of WordPress, but still using Gutenberg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I want to know why. I want to know why was it that you decided to take that on board? I can imagine there&amp;#8217;s a whole bunch of reasons, but they would be guesses. So let&amp;#8217;s delve right into&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:10:09] Timothy Jacobs: Yeah, so I think one of the big things is that the user experience that the block editor provides, while there&amp;#8217;s always places that it can be improved, is really excellent. There are so many tools out there where the first years of their development are, how do we build a good UI for dragging things onto the screen and making it look like you would expect it to look.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And how do we, you know, have settings that adjust things and make tweaks and have visual changes? And how do I navigate to different areas, and how do I present blocks of content? I think WordPress, the block editor in Gutenberg, isn&amp;#8217;t really the only block based system that&amp;#8217;s out there. Lots of different tools have come to realize the power of the block.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the block editor in Gutenberg being open source, lets us have tons of customization ability. So it really gave us a great headstart for building out an application user interface, where we could get right down to the meat of it, instead of worrying about all of the bits that go into building a WYSIWYG block editor interface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:11:13] Nathan Wrigley: It&amp;#8217;s almost like the use case for using WordPress to build a website in a way, isn&amp;#8217;t it? Because it does a bunch of the heavy lifting for you. You don&amp;#8217;t have to invent all the user permissions yourself, and write all of that code. You can get yourself off to a flying start by implementing something which is freely available and ready to roll.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:11:31] Timothy Jacobs: Exactly. It gives you that same kind of headstart. And it also provides like a great prototype experience. The first prototype that we built out was just by building some custom blocks in a WordPress, Gutenberg system. Not even with a whole Laravel side of things. It&amp;#8217;s just a great place to prototype.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:11:48] Nathan Wrigley: So Steve, I don&amp;#8217;t know if you have anything to add to that, but basically why Gutenberg? If you&amp;#8217;ve got a different answer than Timothy&amp;#8217;s, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:11:56] Steve Bruner: Tim&amp;#8217;s the CTO, so his is a little more technical. Mine would be a little more business oriented, I guess. First off, the Gutenberg UI is proven, right. It&amp;#8217;s a proven UI that works well, and millions of people and millions of websites use it every day to build websites. So not having to deal with that, not having to work on a UI and go through the whole trial and error process really was appealing to us.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg gave us, we probably would&amp;#8217;ve taken two years, three years to build this out if it wasn&amp;#8217;t for Gutenberg. So having that head start, having a UI that&amp;#8217;s proven, that works. And if you&amp;#8217;re coming from the WordPress world, you&amp;#8217;ll feel natural. You&amp;#8217;ll feel comfortable in Engine Awesome, because it&amp;#8217;s Gutenberg, right? We have some custom blocks and some custom workflows, but at the heart of it is Gutenberg, and you will, you&amp;#8217;ll feel very comfortable using it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:12:48] Nathan Wrigley: So given that Gutenberg itself has been how to describe it? It&amp;#8217;s been tumultuous over the last few years. You know, there&amp;#8217;s been a lot of changes, a lot of rapid iterations. I guess that&amp;#8217;s slowed down a little bit more recently when the whole project seemed to move over to full site editing and all of that. Is that a concern of yours? Have you frozen your version of Gutenberg in time? Or are you keeping up with the very latest and greatest that that project offers?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:13:13] Timothy Jacobs: We are keeping very up to date. I think we are one version of Gutenberg behind usually. And that&amp;#8217;s where we like to keep it at. But yeah, just a couple of weeks ago, we added support for fixed positioning. Which was a feature that the main Gutenberg team had just introduced. So we see that the, like, iteration speed of Gutenberg is a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A big thing is that as Gutenberg is maturing, and now we&amp;#8217;re seeing Gutenberg with the isolated block editor project and coming to the wordpress.org forums. And of course what Automattic is doing with Tumblr, that the core WordPress Gutenberg packages, while they are moving very fast and you do have to keep up with them, they are kind of stable enough that you can build on top of them in this way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And they have to be so that those projects don&amp;#8217;t just keep breaking. And so WordPress.org doesn&amp;#8217;t just keep breaking. While it is not as stable, let&amp;#8217;s say as WordPress Core pre 5.0, and just building on top of the WordPress Core PHP. I think it&amp;#8217;s stable enough to build on top of, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:14:19] Nathan Wrigley: Did the nature of what you were trying to achieve, and we can dig into exactly what it is that you are solving in a little while, but did the paradigm of blocks fit pretty neatly? In other words can you. atomize your workflow inside of Engine Awesome into a collection of blocks basically? Drag in blocks, reposition blocks, fill in data into blocks, and that&amp;#8217;s essentially what the app is doing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:14:43] Timothy Jacobs: Yeah, I think so. At its core in Engine Awesome, each field, each bit of data that you&amp;#8217;re putting into your, let&amp;#8217;s say CRM or invoice management system, each one of those fields is a block that you create. So starting from that level of, hey, we have a block, which is a field that data can be entered into. And it doesn&amp;#8217;t just look like, let&amp;#8217;s say a plain text field, it looks something a bit more of a rich application user interfaced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The field and the block being like that common low level bit that we build on top of. Yeah, it does make, I think the block-based paradigm a good fit. There are some struggles with a block-based paradigm, and achieving some more complex layouts where things aren&amp;#8217;t just neatly stacked in rows and stacked in columns, like a grid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that is something that&amp;#8217;s getting more and more possible to with Gutenberg every few releases. But I do think that the block-based nature, being able to map over to every block as a field did make it a good match, of philosophically in that sense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:15:45] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, right from the outset. Matt Mullenweg ages ago, I don&amp;#8217;t exactly know when, he had this, what felt like a really almost crystal ball gazing idea that Gutenberg as the editor would become almost synonymous with entering data across the whole internet. It would become something which was used everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg itself would become bigger than WordPress and all of that kind of thing. Do you see this? Do you see people doing what you are doing out there? In other words, does the Gutenberg interface, is it increasingly cropping up in places just like Engine Awesome?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:16:20] Timothy Jacobs: I&amp;#8217;m not sure if I&amp;#8217;ve seen many cases. There are some that are out there. There is a Laraberg, as I believe the combination of names and how they landed on that one of combining Laravel plus Gutenberg, more for like a page editor context. The same way that is used in WordPress Core.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As well as I believe there&amp;#8217;s a Drupal integration. And I think a couple of other things. Of course, there&amp;#8217;s the isolated block editor project and what Tumblr is doing. I haven&amp;#8217;t seen a lot of people though that are doing it to the degree that we are doing it, in terms of, hey, we&amp;#8217;re letting you build an application as opposed to letting you design a webpage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so I don&amp;#8217;t think we are there yet. But I think the stabilization over the past year has made it more of a possibility for projects who are looking to adopt Gutenberg in that way absolutely can, and I think it&amp;#8217;s something worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:17:10] Nathan Wrigley: How much of the core Gutenberg blocks do you bring along? And how much of it is bespoke work for your application? I&amp;#8217;m presuming, I mean, you alluded to it earlier. I think you said you&amp;#8217;ve got some of your own custom blocks in there. Do you bring almost everything along for the ride, including, I don&amp;#8217;t know, the Vimeo embed block or whatever it may be? Or do you pull out a certain amount and keep a certain amount only?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:17:32] Timothy Jacobs: Yes, this is actually, it&amp;#8217;s a really interesting question in terms of how functionality in Gutenberg these days gets divided. So we don&amp;#8217;t bring in any core WordPress Gutenberg blocks. But what we are able to do is, as we&amp;#8217;ve had the introduction of global styles in the full site editor experience. There&amp;#8217;s been more of a separation of, what are things that are really blocks and what are things that are settings that your blocks can opt in to.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So for instance in Engine Awesome, you can use the margin tools, and the padding tools, and the sizing tools, and the colors, and the text sizes. All of these different systems. And the way that we support that in Engine Awesome is we just say in our block.json, hey, we want this feature. Gutenberg, render me the UI for it. Build me the styles. Save all of it to the block metadata information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg, you handle all of that. And what I&amp;#8217;ll do is I&amp;#8217;ll render the part that you see in the canvas, the actual block UI. But core Gutenberg is able to handle those types of controls. So that&amp;#8217;s where we&amp;#8217;ve really made the delineation, is that we don&amp;#8217;t use the core blocks, but we use all of the features that the core blocks use. And are able to pull them in without having to copy thousands of lines of code. So we for instance, have a text block and a group block, and they&amp;#8217;re a few dozen lines of code that are really just implementing the WordPress core APIs around layout and around rich text.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:19:09] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s interesting because I&amp;#8217;m looking at your homepage now and there&amp;#8217;s a video on there showing what is obviously to me, the Gutenberg interface. I guess to your customers maybe they&amp;#8217;ll recognize it as that, maybe not. But it shows the inserter, the panel on the left opening up, and it really does look the same.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so I made the mistake of thinking they were core blocks because many of them map really similarly. You know, you&amp;#8217;ve got a text field and then you&amp;#8217;ve got a URL and the iconography looks remarkably similarly. You haven&amp;#8217;t really tweaked that in any way. It really, really looks like the interface right down to the colors and everything is exactly the same. Black text, black icons, blue buttons, looks similar. That&amp;#8217;s a curious choice that you decided not to fiddle with the design of it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:19:54] Timothy Jacobs: Yeah, I think the design of the block editor, like Steve was mentioning, is really well proven. And I think there are places where maybe in the future that we do more customization, based off of how our users are going to be using Engine Awesome. And the differences between the block editor in WordPress Core for designing pages and the block editor in Engine Awesome for designing applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#8217;t think we wanted to take an approach of, well, let&amp;#8217;s just redesign it for the sake of redesigning it without knowing hey, here are these specific UX benefits that we want to change and we want to improve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other aspect of it, to be honest, is that some of these components are harder to tweak than others. Like the inserter, for instance, is a very complex component. So we don&amp;#8217;t want to just say like, okay, let&amp;#8217;s rip it all apart. That&amp;#8217;s one of the aspects where I think you can get into a little bit of trickiness with the rapid pace of Gutenberg development. Is that if you rip everything and everything and everything down to its very bare bone bits, then it is a lot harder to stay up to date with Gutenberg and to be on the latest versions. It makes each upgrade a little bit more of a chore. Whereas for us upgrading Gutenberg isn&amp;#8217;t very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:21:15] Nathan Wrigley: So I guess if you&amp;#8217;re a listener to this podcast, the chances are that you&amp;#8217;ve played with Gutenberg in the past and you&amp;#8217;ve experienced how it works and this whole process in Engine Awesome will be really familiar to you. But it also raises the question, you know, in WordPress there&amp;#8217;s a whole ton of different blocks out there now. If you, you know, you can go to the internet and download thousands, possibly tens of thousands of different blocks. And, so you are using that block methodology in your application.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It feels like we&amp;#8217;ve sidestep the, the most important question, which is what on earth, what an earth does this SaaS platform actually do? So it might be a good idea to bring Steve back in at this point and ask what is Engine Awesome? What is it doing?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:21:56] Steve Bruner: Yeah. So like I mentioned before, I&amp;#8217;ve been running a small business for almost 20 years. Full-time for, you know, close to 10. And I&amp;#8217;ve tried every piece of software out there to help you run your business, right? I&amp;#8217;ve tried every CRM. I&amp;#8217;ve tried every project management tool and to-do list and anything you can imagine, I&amp;#8217;ve tried.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And to be honest with you, I haven&amp;#8217;t loved any of &amp;#8217;em. And anybody I&amp;#8217;ve spoken to has said the same thing. Usually when you try these out of the box solutions, you feel like you&amp;#8217;re overpaying for a product where you&amp;#8217;re only using 50, 60% of the features. And they keep loading it up with more features and they keep raising the price.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Engine Awesome you get to build exactly what you want. You build the CRM that you want in the way you work. The way your team works. The way your business works. We have had clients that have taken paper forms that they&amp;#8217;ve used in their business and replicated them in Engine Awesome. And their employees just log in and they know how to use it. There&amp;#8217;s nothing strange here anymore. They see the same form they&amp;#8217;ve been using for years, it&amp;#8217;s just a digital version. So training comes down and training costs come down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, there are other no-code platforms out there. We realize that there are others that are doing this. Our goal is to make it simple. To make it really, really simple for you to get your application up, right. Tim and I always talk about getting our clients up and running in minutes, not months. You don&amp;#8217;t have to know anything about databases to use Engine Awesome. You don&amp;#8217;t have to know about key fields and indexing fields. You don&amp;#8217;t have to know how to build relationships. You don&amp;#8217;t have to do any of that stuff. Engine Awesome takes care of it for you very easily. Just drag and drop some blocks, check a box, press save, and you&amp;#8217;re ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:23:55] Nathan Wrigley: I&amp;#8217;m seeing when I&amp;#8217;m on your homepage, I&amp;#8217;m seeing what looked like the two UIs. I&amp;#8217;m seeing the Gutenberg UI, which obviously has a purpose, but I&amp;#8217;m also seeing like another UI where I don&amp;#8217;t know what&amp;#8217;s going on there. Is it, do you have a UI to build the blocks themselves and then they&amp;#8217;re created inside of Gutenberg to drop in whatever data it is that you need to put into that particular block?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:24:18] Timothy Jacobs: Yeah, so we have two different base points. They&amp;#8217;re both Gutenberg. But the first step of building your Engine Awesome application is deciding what fields that you want to support. So what data you want to collect. And this is just dragging from the inserter, a URL, or a name, or a color, and bringing them into a separate editor where you see all the list of fields that you&amp;#8217;ve created for this particular, what we call an object type. For WordPress users it would kind of be most analogous to a custom post type.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so your contact, for instance, might have a name field, a phone, an address, things like that. Those fields that you define when you&amp;#8217;re editing your object type, make up the inserter, make up the block library when you then edit your layouts. So you first define your kind of data that you&amp;#8217;re looking to collect. And then you can define as many different user interfaces that you want to show that data or collect that data. And Steve can give some good examples of how that interface building portion happens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:25:19] Steve Bruner: Yeah, so a lot of our clients come from using spreadsheets, for instance. Just giant spreadsheets. 30 columns, thousands of rows. And it&amp;#8217;s really easy for them to work with Engine Awesome, right. So as Tim mentioned, first they define their object and then they literally are transferring those fields from a spreadsheet to Engine Awesome using the blocks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then they go and start creating their layouts. And the layouts are, they could be forms, right? Where you&amp;#8217;re entering data. They could be tables where you are viewing data. They can be queries where you&amp;#8217;re searching for data. And those layouts also are conditional.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They can change based upon data that&amp;#8217;s entered. So, for instance, if you have quote that you provided through an Engine Awesome system, and that quote is in maybe an open status, you will see certain fields that are there. But once that quote gets changed to an approved status, those fields will be locked, right?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;re not changing the quote after it&amp;#8217;s been approved. So fields are locked. Nobody on your team can enter data or edit data anymore. And then you can move through a process. And again, I just want to reiterate, that is not a set process in Engine Awesome, that&amp;#8217;s a process that somebody would&amp;#8217;ve built, right? Everything is custom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So those layouts, change in Engine Awesome. One other UI I guess that we have. We recently brought in the full site editing experience, or I guess the full, Tim can talk more about this, but the full site editing UI as the actual application UI. So when you are building your object and building your layouts, you see the inserter, the settings, Gutenberg like everyone is really familiar with it. But when you&amp;#8217;re using the application, when your team is using the application, when they&amp;#8217;re in the field or in the office, we are using the full site editing experience with the full site editing menu. And Tim, maybe you want to elaborate on that?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:27:20] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, please.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:27:21] Timothy Jacobs: Yeah, so you can kind of see this, if you go into our post, Engine Awesome has a new look. And you can kind of see that delineation there. Basically the Gutenberg team introduced a really fantastic collection of navigation elements. And so we were able to use those to say, here&amp;#8217;s how you navigate between different views, between different object types, between different sets of data. And use that navigation experience that the core Gutenberg team provided.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:27:48] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I will link to that post. But anybody listening, there&amp;#8217;s a blog post. Currently it&amp;#8217;s linked in the footer, but I imagine over time it will disappear from the footer of the main homepage. It&amp;#8217;s called Engine Awesome has a new look and you can see the site editor panel on the left and all of that. Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s a really interesting implementation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So you build out the structure of the data you want to consume, you then have the option to display that. Presumably there must be a whole piece of making that data interact with other data points.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, you know, you just mentioned that something is marked as approved. So certain fields get locked up. But presumably there are relationships, child, parent relationships, one-to-one, and so on and so forth, that bind the data together. Otherwise, you&amp;#8217;re looking at a spreadsheet, aren&amp;#8217;t you, really? So there must be something more in here.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:28:35] Timothy Jacobs: Exactly. So when you edit your object type, you can set up a relationship between another bit of data, and then when you do that by dragging a block. So you&amp;#8217;ll see in your inserter, for instance, let&amp;#8217;s say that you are editing a contacts object type, and you already have a company&amp;#8217;s object type set up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The only thing that you need to do is drag a block that says that this contact has one company and then Engine Awesome takes care of the rest. And so then when you&amp;#8217;re building out a layout, let&amp;#8217;s say for a company, you can easily display a list of all of the contacts that are associated with that company or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#8217;re editing a contact, you can say, hey, here&amp;#8217;s a snapshot of information about this company. Maybe their address, their website, a photo of them. Just to give that contextual information. So you can set up all of those object types and all of those relationships just by dragging a block into the block editor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:29:29] Nathan Wrigley: Steve, it sounded like you wanted to chip in there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:29:31] Steve Bruner: I was just going to give you a couple of use cases so you can get a good understanding of how people are using Engine Awesome. So recently a non-profit provided us a spreadsheet, a thousand rows, 26 or 30 columns, and they were tracking their donors in it. And it really is not the best way to do that. In five minutes, and I really mean this, I&amp;#8217;m not joking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Five minutes, maybe six, on a Zoom call with this prospective customer, I built an application for him where he was able to enter donors and then keep a record, a log of donations. See those donations, filter those donations, and get a good understanding of what&amp;#8217;s going on. So it was really really quick and is going to change the way he does his job and his team&amp;#8217;s job, and everyone&amp;#8217;s just going to be, everyone&amp;#8217;s life is going to be easier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have a home cleaning service, a residential home cleaning service. Tim has done a great video, you&amp;#8217;ll find it on our YouTube channel about how to build a service business application, and in 30 minutes, and this is a live video that Tim did, and you&amp;#8217;ll go through it. Tim is not going quickly at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in 30 minutes he built an application that tracks this home cleaning services clients. The jobs they do. Their team members and their teams. They go into people&amp;#8217;s homes, they bring up Engine Awesome on their phone. They view their jobs. They mark their job cleaning when they&amp;#8217;re starting to clean, and then they go through this whole process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when they&amp;#8217;re done, they mark it done. Eventually they&amp;#8217;re going to be taking credit cards using Engine Awesome. So, we have a Zapier integration where when the job is done, the client will get an email automatically with a payment link. And this is changing her business, right? Right now, she deals with cash or check or Zelle. Sometimes people forget. And it&amp;#8217;s just making her life much easier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even something crazy like a marketing company that has displays in Home Depot stores. They are going to be doing a test in a couple of hundred Home Depot stores. And they built a UI in Engine Awesome that tracks stores and products and promotions and using our web hooks and API, they&amp;#8217;re going to be pushing data to those stores, to those displays, and managing it all in Engine Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So ideas that we never even thought of, people are starting to use Engine Awesome for some really, really creative ideas. You know, at the core of it, Tim and I really are passionate about helping businesses be more productive every day. And I think these use cases give a good, broad example of that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:32:06] Nathan Wrigley: I don&amp;#8217;t know if either of you have ever used a piece of software called Airtable? But Airtable came around, I don&amp;#8217;t know, maybe five or six years ago and it felt like a really, quite an interesting piece of technology at the time, in that you could put data in, it was basically a spreadsheet, but then it could show you that data, back at you in a variety of different ways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So that leads me to the question, is that possible here? It sounds like the answer&amp;#8217;s yes. So, as an example, let&amp;#8217;s say that I&amp;#8217;m a real estate agent and I&amp;#8217;m updating data about houses on my roster. And I&amp;#8217;ve input all the fields. I&amp;#8217;ve got images. I&amp;#8217;ve got prices and descriptions and maps of floor plans, all of that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for me to create bespoke layouts of that data? So rather than it just being an Airtable, which looks like, well, a spreadsheet, you&amp;#8217;ve got other options in there, but basically a spreadsheet. Is it possible for me to, I don&amp;#8217;t know, float images right? Or highlight this particular aspect of the text? Make this a heading and you know, add iconography.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words can I make the data engaging to look at? And further to that, can I bind those presentation layers to members of my team? So for example, could the sales director see a different layout of different data and somebody who&amp;#8217;s in marketing, front of shop, might be able to show data to a customer that walks in the store? That kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:33:23] Steve Bruner: Yeah, so it&amp;#8217;s interesting you brought up Airtable, right? Because Airtable is a no-code solution that, like you said, is mostly a spreadsheet. And I want to get back to that because I think Tim and I, we feel a little differently than the way Airtable and some other no-code solutions do their business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But to answer your question, yes. You can build really compelling, beautiful layouts using Engine Awesome. Because you&amp;#8217;re using the Gutenberg design tools, right ? So you&amp;#8217;re essentially designing a webpage, but it&amp;#8217;s a, you know, maybe it&amp;#8217;s a form or tables or some type of layout. But yes, you can float things, right? You can float through things left. You can bold, change colors. We have themes. We brought in themes as well. So with one click you can change the color and style of your application.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In terms of different team members using Engine Awesome and seeing different things and seeing different items. This is a really important point, right. Tim and I are actually going through this right now. How we want the user roles and capability system to work i Engine Awesome. Because our goal, and this is the goal we&amp;#8217;ve had since day one. I think this is also what makes us different from a lot of no-code solutions out there, is that we want your entire team using Engine Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#8217;t charge per user, and I think that&amp;#8217;s a really important point, right? We really are charging per organization or per team. We want everybody, we want your part-timers to use Engine Awesome. You want the CEO to use Engine Awesome. Everybody in between. You shouldn&amp;#8217;t have to pick and choose who needs to use an application. We really believe at our core that when your entire team is on the same page and uses the same application, and can see the same data, your life&amp;#8217;s going to be better. Your business will be better. Everybody will be more productive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#8217;re working really hard to make sure we have this roles and capabilities system that allows to do exactly what you&amp;#8217;re talking about, and really fine tune it. So that everyone is on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:35:28] Nathan Wrigley: Timothy, anything to add to that?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:35:30] Timothy Jacobs: Yeah, I would mention one thing, which is that right now we have things set up so that you can have different levels of permission. So you can have and invite users onto your team that can just read data, for instance, or who can just edit data, but they can&amp;#8217;t make changes to your application. But yeah, the next big thing is figuring out what it looks like and how do you make it intuitive for users to set up an application where they consider different things like permissions and capabilities?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are some tools that, the kind of permission system is really just visibility. And if you&amp;#8217;re a developer, you can sneak under the hood and they throw warnings all over the documentation that, hey, you know, even though you&amp;#8217;re, you think you&amp;#8217;re hiding this data, you&amp;#8217;re not actually hiding this data. Because it still gets sent to every user&amp;#8217;s browser or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So thinking through ways to make it very intuitive for users to say, hey, how do we actually set up our permission model, is the thing we&amp;#8217;re exploring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:36:28] Nathan Wrigley: Will it be possible to change the data on, for want of a better word, the front end? In other words, if you&amp;#8217;ve input the data in one UI, but then you&amp;#8217;re looking at the way it&amp;#8217;s presented, the theme, if you like. Is it possible for, and again, user permissions, we&amp;#8217;ll assume that that&amp;#8217;s coming down the pike, but is it possible to have people change the data in the different displays? Or do you have to always return to the, if you like, WordPress post to amend that data?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:36:55] Timothy Jacobs: Yeah, so you can edit the data everywhere. This is a trend that we&amp;#8217;ve been seeing with a lot of these different tools. Is that they give you different layouts that can present your data, but at the core of it, they all have a data mode where you&amp;#8217;re basically looking at a spreadsheet or a very, I&amp;#8217;ll say charitably, a plainly designed form that doesn&amp;#8217;t have a sense of hierarchy or related bits of information. And then you can present it in any way that you would want.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For us though, the first thing that we wanted to tackle was to make sure that when you presented and created a beautiful layout, that your users could also edit the data in that layout. So right now we don&amp;#8217;t have, for instance, a separate kind of raw spreadsheet like view into your data. That&amp;#8217;s something that is on our roadmap. But our main actual priority is for users to be entering in data through the rich UIs that you create.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:37:48] Nathan Wrigley: I feel that&amp;#8217;s one of the, one of the great advances recently. The ability to change it wherever you are. I think that would be really good. Because it is frustrating if, well, you&amp;#8217;re looking at the data that you want to amend and then you have to, in WordPress parlance, click edit post and then go and find that field and amend that field and then click save and then go back and make sure it looks how it ought to look. That&amp;#8217;s just one of the best things about this whole approach, isn&amp;#8217;t it? Is that you can do it right there on the front end.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just moving slightly. Obviously you&amp;#8217;re a SaaS app. You&amp;#8217;re consuming all sorts of data. Probably you can imagine where this question&amp;#8217;s going. If you are consuming, I don&amp;#8217;t know, email addresses, images, all sorts of financial information, whatever it may be. How are you storing that? Where is that data being kept? If I&amp;#8217;m in the EU, do you have it in a certain jurisdiction? Is it encrypted? Let&amp;#8217;s just leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:38:41] Timothy Jacobs: Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s a great question. So right now we don&amp;#8217;t have a separate EU instance for instance. Unintentional rhyming there. But the way that we&amp;#8217;ve set this up is, we are using MongoDB as our database system. And each team that gets created gets their own, essentially database inside of MongoDB to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So right now that&amp;#8217;s all centrally part of Digital Ocean&amp;#8217;s managed database service and their encryption at rest and so on and so forth. And there are a lot of great security practices. In the future though, what that means is that we&amp;#8217;ll be able to support teams having data that is in a different data center, depending on what their needs are.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And even for potentially more enterprise customers, the need to be able to self-host their own database. Engine Awesome is set up to be able to connect to different database applications. But right now all of that data is stored in Engine Awesome, in Digital Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:39:37] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, thank you. You mentioned enterprise there, but also Steve earlier was talking about examples of local charities and things like that. So is this software basically open to everybody? And on the website, forgive me, it may be that I&amp;#8217;m just not looking all that carefully, but I can&amp;#8217;t see a price. So I don&amp;#8217;t know if that&amp;#8217;s a function of you haven&amp;#8217;t worked out your pricing yet. Or if it&amp;#8217;s a contact us, and we&amp;#8217;ll talk through what it is that we think you&amp;#8217;re going to need, and we&amp;#8217;ll work out the pricing accordingly. But are you aiming at all the people all the time. Enterprise, just small mom and pop stores. How are you launching and what is the pricing model?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:40:14] Steve Bruner: So right now most of our clients are small to medium size businesses. We&amp;#8217;re not writing off enterprise, we just realize that enterprise may need other features that we don&amp;#8217;t have yet. Like single sign-on or maybe a, you know, a dedicated SLA or something of that nature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;#8217;re not there yet. Obviously we&amp;#8217;re happy to talk to enterprise. There is one larger company that expressed an interest in Engine Awesome, and we&amp;#8217;ve been talking to them. But right now, all of our clients have been small to medium sized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pricing model we&amp;#8217;re still playing with. Again, we don&amp;#8217;t want to charge per user. So we&amp;#8217;ve been playing with all sorts of ideas. The number of records you use. Or the resources you use. Our goal is to get you and your entire team on Engine Awesome, and we&amp;#8217;re willing to do whatever it takes to get you there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, right now we have a manual onboarding process. If you sign up for Engine Awesome, you&amp;#8217;re scheduling a Zoom call with me. So we have a talk. I find out what your needs are, how you plan on using Engine Awesome, your pain points. And we talk it through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And at that point we start working out where Engine Awesome fits into your plan. For smaller teams, we&amp;#8217;re in the $10 range a month, $15 range a month, $20 a month. But we&amp;#8217;re not really going much higher than that right now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:41:42] Nathan Wrigley: Are you going to be making use? So we&amp;#8217;re in phase three of Gutenberg, which is for want of a better word, concurrent editing. Think Google Docs. Are you going to be making use of that? I mean, I can see that being incredibly useful if it&amp;#8217;s pulled off. But is that something that you are thinking about implementing?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:42:00] Timothy Jacobs: I would love to. It&amp;#8217;s something that I&amp;#8217;m seeing, and I&amp;#8217;m really, really excited to see how that evolves. I&amp;#8217;m really curious how the core Gutenberg team is going to approach designing that. I think there&amp;#8217;s a lot of UX patterns that are going to be challenging. And seeing them pull that off is going to be really interest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then seeing how that connects to WordPress. Is it going to be like peer to peer? Is it going to go through WordPress, as the PHP backend? What is all that going to look like from a technical perspective I think will also be fascinating. For us, I think one of the benefits of being a SaaS application is that it makes it a little bit easier for us to do that kind of orchestration, because we control what the backend is.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But of course with WordPress, when we&amp;#8217;re building for WordPress, we&amp;#8217;re building for like 45% of the web. So the technical requirements are a lot more of a challenge. Yeah, I&amp;#8217;m keeping a keen eye on that and I&amp;#8217;m really excited to see how that progresses. Because, yeah, I think that&amp;#8217;ll take Gutenberg to high Peaks, and will be something that a lot of different people building on top of the block editor, on top of the Gutenberg project will be able to utilize.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:43:07] Nathan Wrigley: That was kind of like a roadmap question, but in disguise. Let&amp;#8217;s just ask it outright. Just outline for us in the near future, we&amp;#8217;re recording this towards the middle of February, so depending on how long it takes this podcast episode to actually make it out into the public, some of these things may have come a along already. But just outline roughly, maybe let&amp;#8217;s go for six months, eight months, something like that. What&amp;#8217;s the plan? What are you hoping to implement?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:43:32] Steve Bruner: Well, our customers are always giving us ideas, right? So things do change like you mentioned. Our priority of right now is user roles and capabilities. Once that&amp;#8217;s integrated, and that&amp;#8217;s going to take a little bit because not only do we need to plan it out and how it&amp;#8217;s going to work technically. We also need to make it super simple to implement, so clients can do this and feel comfortable that the right people are seeing the right data. So that is going to take a little bit of time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;E-commerce would probably be our next big focus. Our clients want to start taking payments from their clients, right? The cleaning service is a great example. Right now the plan for her is to email a Stripe payment link to her clients, but we want to make things a little bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also that feature would, currently being done through Zapier. Which is an additional charge. So we want to bring that into Engine Awesome, where we can make it seamless and where our clients won&amp;#8217;t have to pay any more for that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those are probably the two major features that we want to roll out in the next six months. There are other things we want to do. We want to do, you know, we want to add scheduling. Again, a lot of our clients are service businesses. So scheduling is a big part of that, and they&amp;#8217;re using services like Calendly, and if we can do something better or bring it into Engine Awesome , make it easier for them to use, then we want to be able to do that as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:44:55] Nathan Wrigley: The introductions at the top of the show made it pretty obvious that you&amp;#8217;ve got a history of giving back to WordPress. So, forgive me if this question sounds ill placed. But given that you are leveraging quite a lot of the Gutenberg project to build out your SaaS app, I&amp;#8217;m just wondering what your posture is in terms of giving back from Engine Awesome. Back to Gutenberg. Again caveat emptor. Sorry, I know that you both do more than enough already, but I just wondered if that was part of the ethics of the business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:45:28] Timothy Jacobs: Yeah, I&amp;#8217;m a big believer in that I think the Gutenberg project gets better the more different use cases that we have. Historically, my contributions to WordPress have been mainly focused on the REST API, and how Gutenberg interacts with the REST API. But I hope to be able to dive in more and more into the core Gutenberg project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I think being good stewards of the open source community is a key aspect to building on top of an open source project. Both from, this is the best thing to do from a kind of community standpoint. But I think also everyone should really be thinking about how they contribute back to Gutenberg. So that we have a say in shaping how Gutenberg moves forward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a lot of work to do, and we all have different pet features or things that we might want to have changed or improved in Gutenberg. And, really the long and short of it is that there&amp;#8217;s more work to do than there are contributors to do the work. So the more of us that can contribute back to the Gutenberg project and the WordPress Core project, the faster we&amp;#8217;re all able to go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:46:39] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you, Steve. Anything there?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:46:42] Steve Bruner: No, Tim said it all. Tim said it best. He&amp;#8217;s been a core contributor for a long time. Our goal from day one, like you mentioned, we&amp;#8217;ve been contributing to the WordPress community in both code and education for a very long time and we want to continue to do that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:46:57] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s a nice answer to hear actually. That&amp;#8217;s very heartening. Thank you. Should anybody have been listening to this podcast, had their interest peaked. They&amp;#8217;re either interested in talking about what you did with Gutenberg from a technological point of view, because maybe they&amp;#8217;re thinking of adopting Gutenberg in their own platform. Or they just want to actually find out what they can do with Engine Awesome themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know if you want to answer this question separately or combined, but where is the best place to get in touch? Is it a contact form? An email address? Is it, dare I say it, Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:47:30] Steve Bruner: Right now our website is really the best place to contact us. So engineawesome.com. On the homepage if you are interested in signing up, or just getting on a Zoom call with me to learn more, there&amp;#8217;s a input right there where you can put in your email address and sign up for that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And we also have a contact form where if you have questions about Gutenberg and how we did this and you want a more heavy developer talk, you want to chat with Tim, then that&amp;#8217;s the place to let us know.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:47:59] Timothy Jacobs: Yeah, you can also always find me on the make make dot WordPress Slack. That&amp;#8217;s also a great place to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:48:05] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. Thank you Timothy Jacobs and Steve Bruner. Thanks for joining me on the podcast today to talk about Engine Awesome. I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:48:13] Steve Bruner: Thank you, Nathan. I really, I really enjoyed this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:48:15] Timothy Jacobs: Thanks for having us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the podcast today we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/users/sbruner/&quot;&gt;Steve Bruner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://profiles.wordpress.org/timothyblynjacobs/&quot;&gt;Timothy Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Steve has been active in the WordPress community for the past 17 years. He&amp;#8217;s a WordPress developer, co-organizer of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/WordPressNYC/&quot;&gt;WordPressNYC Meetup&lt;/a&gt;, and has organised many WordCamps in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Timothy is a WordPress Core Committer for the REST API, and has been a WordPress developer for over ten years. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://stellarwp.com/&quot;&gt;StellarWP&lt;/a&gt;, he leads development of the iThemes Security plugin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What brings them together is that theyâre both founders of a SaaS app called &lt;a href=&quot;https://engineawesome.com/&quot;&gt;Engine Awesome&lt;/a&gt;, where Steve is the CEO and Timothy is the CTO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What has this got to do with WordPress, you might ask. Well, theyâre here today to talk about Gutenberg, but not how you might expect. Itâs Gutenberg outside of WordPress, but Gutenberg nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like all of WordPress, Gutenberg is open source. You are free to download it, modify it, and use it in whatever way you like. When Steve and Timothy began working on their new project, and needed a way for their clients to interact with it, they found Gutenberg was the perfect tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We talk about what benefits theyâve gained by using Gutenberg. How itâs saved them time, and how itâs fast becoming a stable and mature product, which is easy for non-technical users to understand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We get into the details of which parts of Gutenberg they used, and which parts were not suitable for their app. Theyâve been building their own blocks which work well in the UI, but which are more suited to the kinds of data that theyâre gathering.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discussion then moves onto what Engine Awesome actually does. Itâs an app builder in which you can construct your own data containers and theme them so that it displays in any way you like. They tell us about the features which they have so far, as well as the items which are on their roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Towards the end, we talk about their commitment to continue contributing back to the Gutenberg project, and how they feel that itâs in everyoneâs interest if the project gets better from any updates that they have made.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If youâre looking to build your own SaaS app, or youâre just curious about how Gutenberg is being deployed outside of WordPress, this podcast is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Atarim to Host 4th Annual Virtual Web Agency Summit April 25-28</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=143723</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/atarim-to-host-4th-annual-virtual-web-agency-summit-april-25-28</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Atarim is hosting its 4th annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://atarim.io/summit/&quot;&gt;Web Agency Summit&lt;/a&gt; from April 25-28. The virtual event is geared towards web agencies and WordPress professionals, with topics focused on web trends, scaling an agency or freelance business, attracting high-paying clients, and building recurring revenue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Web Agency Summit was born out of the organizers&amp;#8217; frustration with the first WordCamp Asia getting canceled at the beginning of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When WordCamp Asia was first canceled, I had a lot of thoughts, of course,&amp;#8221; ScaleMath founder Alex Panagis said. &amp;#8220;Something that we were somewhat really hoping would help us make a big splash in the industry was pulled away from right under us.Â &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But, instead of letting this setback get to us â we decided we had to do something.Â We decided to step up and host what was then the first (and went on to be the biggest) virtual summit in our industry. Sponsors like GoDaddy, WordPress.org, and many more were quite quick to step in, to the point where we were overwhelmed by the support we received and how well-received the entire summit concept was.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;#8217;s lineup includes representatives from Microsoft, Google, Yoast, Hubspot, XWP, Elementor, and more, including 40+ WordPress experts. Web Agency Summit includes individual speaker sessions, such as &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Headless WordPress &amp;#8211; does this approach make sense?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;The Role of AI in Content &amp;amp; SEO&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221;  Attendees will have the opportunity to join sessions on boosting client acquisition on LinkedIn, growing a freelancing business, productizing designs, launching a podcast, managing contractor teams, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;#8217;s event will also feature seven expert-led panels: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing Tides:&lt;/strong&gt; How Industry Acquisitions &amp;amp; Investments are Shaping the Future of WordPress, and What It Means For Your Agency&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From Connections to Clients:&lt;/strong&gt; Building Communities for Web Design Agency Growth&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From CMS to Digital Powerhouse:&lt;/strong&gt; The Expansive Power of WordPress and How It Can Reshape the Tech Landscape&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building The Future:&lt;/strong&gt; Exploring the Power of Next Generation Website &amp;amp; Page Builders&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cracking The Code:&lt;/strong&gt; How to Choose the Best Web Hosting for Your Business&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embracing AI in Web Design:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlocking Profitability for Agencies &amp;amp; Freelancer&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Viral Videos:&lt;/strong&gt; Maximizing YouTube for Agency Growth &amp;amp; What Comes Next&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Â Attendees will be able to meet sponsors in a virtual festival village to win prizes, and join breakout rooms to network and make new industry connections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://atarim.io/summit/&quot;&gt;Registration&lt;/a&gt; for the Web Agency Summit is free but seats are limited. Every presentation will be recorded and will be available to watch for free live and for 24 hours following the event.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress Contributors Continue Exploring Migration of Public and Private Messages from Slack to Matrix</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=143725</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributors-continue-exploring-migration-of-public-and-private-messages-from-slack-to-matrix</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In early 2023, WordPress and Matrix contributorsÂ proposed a new Meta team subprojectÂ to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/wordpress-project-to-evaluate-replacing-slack-with-matrix-open-source-chat&quot;&gt;explore replacing Slack communication withÂ Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, an open source federated chat system. After the team&amp;#8217;s most recent meeting, Automattic-sponsored contributor Alex Kirk &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2023/04/06/matrix-chat-summary-april-6-2023/&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; an update on the status of recent experiments in migration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After researching more on migrating public messages, Kirk said the team is now evaluating whether the Apache-2.0 licensedÂ &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/slack-matrix-migration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Slack Matrix migration tool&lt;/a&gt;Â could work for this project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It operates on Slack export files and requires a fresh Synapse server,&amp;#8221; Kirk said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We havenât yet been able to confirm whether it actually can import the messages and hope to be able to share more on the next meeting.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the subject of migrating private messages, Kirk said the team is leaning towards ensuring users have the tools to save their own external archives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;For migrating private messages in DMs or private groups weâve concluded that we wonât want to attempt their migration but will look into providing tools for achieving that,&amp;#8221; Kirk said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Here weâve found thatÂ &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/slack-channel-exporter/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;browser&lt;/a&gt;Â &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/robsi-slack-channel-expor/henmphndbgifealbmebncbdfgkilagbe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;extensions&lt;/a&gt;Â exist which allow you to download your own Slack direct messages inside your browser as a text file. Possibly itâll be our recommendation to use those tools to export the messages for yourself.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kirk also addressed some accessibility concerns that WordPress Accessibility Team contributor Alex Stine raised during a &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2023/03/27/matrix-chat-summary-march-23-2023/&quot;&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; at the end of March: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class=&quot;wp-block-quote&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slack is well supported and accessible to a very wide audience. Something that is not up for argument, a lot of these open-source/decentralized concepts are not accessible to all or most.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The decentralized media world walks a fine line between a great thing and a lot of hypocrisy. On one hand, claiming to give users a voice, on the other hand, knowingly excluding users of assistive tech.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Years of&amp;nbsp;GitHub&amp;nbsp;issues do not lie. Matrix has not been around all that long but there are plenty of other examples that have been around long enoughâ¦The Slack accessibility team is best in its class. They are constantly responsive and very engaged with users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kirk linked to an article published by Mozilla accessibility engineerÂ Marco Zehe titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marcozehe.de/how-to-use-element-and-matrix-with-a-screen-reader/&quot;&gt;How to use Element and Matrix with a screen reader&lt;/a&gt;. Mozilla replaced IRC with Matrix in 2020, identifying Matrix as an &amp;#8220;excellentÂ &lt;em&gt;open community collaboration&lt;/em&gt;Â tool, with robust support for accessibility and community safety.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zehe&amp;#8217;s post is essentially a guide to help those using assistive technology find their way around Element and the Matrix Eco system more easily. It also highlights a few things that do not yet work well, including keyboard navigation for the members list and messages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I hope some of these issues are no longer problems,&amp;#8221; Stine said in response to Kirk sharing the article. &amp;#8220;If they still are, this would be no doubt a far worse experience than Slack was in some of its worst times. The fact that users have to switch their screen reader modes just to have basic functionality support is not cool. Here is the way I see it. If modern apps do not follow a similar pattern for your OS to the point where you have to look up docs to figure out how to use it, it is probably too complicated and/or not accessible by my definition.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The question of whether it would be beneficial for the WordPress project to &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2023/01/25/a-meta-subproject-for-evaluating-matrix/&quot;&gt;replace Slack communication with Matrix&lt;/a&gt; is still yet unanswered, but the initial response to the idea was overwhelmingly positive. More research into the logistics of migration will be a necessary part of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Matrix contributors proposing this new exploration will meet again on Wednesday, April 19, for the regularly scheduled bi-weekly meeting and plan to discuss the research on migrating messages from Slack.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>Gutenberg Times: All Women-release squad for 6.4 , Grid Layout , Pattern for front-page designs and more â Weekend edition #250</title>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;Howdy, &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;250 newsletter editions. WOW. It feels like a nice round number and worth a celebration. The weekend edition of the Gutenberg Times officially became a newsletter, sent via Mailchimp, on Feb. 3rd, 2018 with 12 subscribers. It has much evolved since then. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a stable of my life to connect with you weekly and report on Gutenberg. After all these years (&lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/6XqvRGDs5eLQSCyKUBCBGF?si=e4df7a8278b04efa&quot;&gt;cue in Paul Simon&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s Still Crazy),  I am still infinitely curious about what people create with the block editor. Thank you for your great support and trust. It&amp;#8217;s been a great privilege.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordCamp Europe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is around the corner, and I would like to meet as may subscribers as possible there. &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/pauli-haack/wordcamp-europe?month=2023-06&quot;&gt;My public calendar is open.&lt;/a&gt; This method worked very well, and I met an incredible mix of people at WordCamp Asia this way.  Making a deliberate effort and scheduling an appointment, adds certainty to an otherwise chance encounter in the Hallway track. I will be in town before the WordCamp, so the calendar is also open for the 7th of June, if that fits your schedule better, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also hope to see you at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/contributor-day/&quot;&gt;Contributor Day&lt;/a&gt; on 8th of June.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/contributor-day/#register&quot;&gt;Registration is open&lt;/a&gt; for those who already have a WordCamp Europe ticket.  The organizer team of WCEU also announced that &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/wceu-2023-announces-free-childcare-and-workshop-for-kids&quot;&gt;there will be free child care are and a Kids track.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a side note, we signed the lease for our Munich flat and my husband and I will have a new permanent address starting May 1, 2023. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I hope, you have a fabulous weekend! &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yours, ð&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birgit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot; id=&quot;0-word-press-release-information&quot;&gt;Developing Gutenberg and WordPress&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gutenberg 15.5&lt;/strong&gt; was released last week, and it was a great pleasure for me to discuss it all with &lt;a href=&quot;https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-81-wordpress-6-2-interactivity-api/&quot;&gt;Leonardus Nugraha for the Gutenberg Changelog podcast. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ðï¸ &lt;/strong&gt; New episode:  &lt;a href=&quot;https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-82-gutenberg-15-6-and-proposed-schedule-for-wordpress-6-3/&quot;&gt;Gutenberg Changelog #82 â Gutenberg 15.6 and proposed schedule for WordPress 6.3&lt;/a&gt; with Birgit Pauli-Haack and special guest Nick Diego&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hector Prieto &lt;/strong&gt;proposed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/04/14/wordpress-6-3-planning-proposal-call-for-volunteers/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;release schedule for WordPress 6.3 and opened the call for volunteers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the release squad. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes on the heals of &lt;strong&gt;Josepha Haden Chomphosy&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8216;s invitation to the all-women release squad for 6.4. &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/04/07/preparing-for-the-next-women-nonbinary-release-squad/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparing for the Next Women &amp;amp; Nonbinary Release Squad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Raise your hands in the comments if you want to get involved in the WordPress major release process. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Gooding&lt;/strong&gt; reported on the release for the WP Tavern. Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-15-5-introduces-experimental-grid-layout-support&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gutenberg 15.5 Introduces Experimental Grid Layout Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With all the releases last week,  you might have missed the current call for testing from the FSE Outreach Program by &lt;strong&gt;Anne McCarthy&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/03/29/fse-program-exploration-build-a-block-theme/&quot;&gt;FSE Program Exploration: Build a block theme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; She wrote: &amp;#8220;If youâve never built a block theme, consider this an invitation to give it a try. Tooling has come a long way and the power of whatâs being built is that it allows more folks to dive into the future (and present) of WordPress.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;For this experience, youâll use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/create-block-theme/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Create Block Theme&amp;nbsp;plugin&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;to facilitate the creation and export process, so you can keep what you create!&amp;#8221; To leave your feedback and share your observations, use the comment section of the post. &lt;/p&gt;

With byte-sized news, Tadlock invites you to dive deeper into certain topics, or let you know about new features and updated APIs. The post is for plugin and theme developers alike. It might be worth bookmarking each of the post, so you can quickly skim editions, when looking for a specific feature or update. &lt;/p&gt;

The guide for the exploration is the release post of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/news/2023/03/dolphy/&quot;&gt;WordPress &amp;#8220;Dolphy&amp;#8221; 6.2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

The new sticky option is available when wrapping a header or banner in a Group block. It ensures the block remains within the viewport and is stuck to the top of the page when the content is scrolled.&lt;/p&gt;

Together with the Single Product Details block, store owners can now assemble their unique Single product template together with the block themes. &lt;/p&gt;

	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=143574</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/wceu-2023-announces-free-childcare-and-workshop-for-kids</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Preparations for WordCamp Europe (WCEU) 2023 in Athens are moving forward as the team &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WCEurope/status/1644304356236312577&quot;&gt;will soon be contacting speakers&lt;/a&gt; selected for the event. Organizers have launched a &lt;a href=&quot;https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/speaker-support-program/&quot;&gt;Speaker Support Program&lt;/a&gt; aimed at encouraging more diversity on stage by connecting speakers with companies that are willing to financially support them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WCEU has also opened &lt;a href=&quot;https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/contributor-day/&quot;&gt;registration for Contributor Day&lt;/a&gt;, which will take place on June 8, kicking off the event. Those who are unable attend in person can join in the #contributor-day channel on Slack as well as the specific channels for the contributor teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside Contributor Day, WCEU has announced it will be hosting an interactive &lt;a href=&quot;https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/workshop-for-kids/&quot;&gt;Workshop for Kids&lt;/a&gt; on June 8, to introduce future generations to WordPress. It will cover the basics of WordPress, how to create a website, choose a theme, and publish content. The workshop is open to kids aged 13-16 and all materials will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WCEU will also have free childcare available during the Contributor Day and the main conference from June 8-10, to make the WordCamp more accessible for parents and guardians. Children aged 16 and younger are eligible to attend but must &lt;a href=&quot;https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/childcare-registration/&quot;&gt;register by May 20&lt;/a&gt;, as there is limited availability for childcare.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/call-for-volunteers/&quot;&gt;call for volunteers&lt;/a&gt; is still open with a variety of roles available. Volunteers will receive one or two collectable volunteer t-shirt(s), a free ticket, and an invite to the Social, as well as the experience of contributing back to the WordPress community at one of its largest events.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: BuddyPress to Host Virtual Contributor Day on April 20</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=143652</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/buddypress-to-host-virtual-contributor-day-on-april-20</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the BuddyPress core team will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/2023/04/lets-meet-in-paris-during-the-french-community-contributor-day/&quot;&gt;hosting a contributor day&lt;/a&gt; alongside the French WordPress Community Contributor Day in Paris on April 20, 2023. This in-person event has filled up its registration and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpfr-net.translate.goog/programme-de-la-journee-de-contribution-organisee-a-paris-le-20-04-2023/?_x_tr_sl=fr&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=fr&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&quot;&gt;posted its schedule&lt;/a&gt; already, but BuddyPress core developer Mathieu VietÂ is inviting people to join online to contribute to BuddyPress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As weâre currently working on a very ambitious 12.0 release with the main goal of migrating from our Legacy URL parser to using the WordPress Rewrite API, there are many areas getting your contributions would really help us and make a huge difference,&amp;#8221; Viet said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/buddypress-12-0-to-focus-on-merging-bp-rewrites-into-core-moving-legacy-widgets-into-bp-classic-plugin&quot;&gt;BuddyPress 12.0&lt;/a&gt; is expected to be released May 31, 2023, and merging the BP Rewrites feature plugin into the core plugin will be a major change that impacts the entire BuddyPress ecosystem. The effort to migrate BuddyPressâ custom URI parser to use WordPressâ Rewrite API has been in the works for the past decade. Contributors will also be providing backwards compatibility via a new plugin calledÂ &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buddypress/bp-classic&quot;&gt;BP Classic&lt;/a&gt;Â that will contain BuddyPressâ legacy widgets. The virtual contributor day will organize code contributions towards these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to code, people can also contribute to documentation regarding how developers can prepare their themes and plugins to be ready for BP Rewrites, and documentation for end users on how the change will benefit their BuddyPress experience. Viet also intends to organize some common troubleshooting tips for the inevitable support forum requests that the major change will generate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The event will run fromÂ &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20230420T0815&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;08:15 UTC&lt;/a&gt;Â toÂ &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20230420T1530&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;15:30 UTC&lt;/a&gt;. Although virtual attendees may miss out on the hot drinks and pastries, they can be equal participants by joining &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/buddypress&quot;&gt;BuddyPress&amp;#8217; Slack channel&lt;/a&gt; and jumping in on one of the projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>BuddyPress: Letâs meet in Paris during the french community contributor day</title>

	<link>https://buddypress.org/2023/04/lets-meet-in-paris-during-the-french-community-contributor-day/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The BuddyPress Core Team is very happy to be represented at the Contributor Day the french WordPress community is organizing in Paris on April 20, 2023. Here&amp;#8217;s a link to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpfr-net.translate.goog/programme-de-la-journee-de-contribution-organisee-a-paris-le-20-04-2023/?_x_tr_sl=fr&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=fr&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;translated page of the event schedule&lt;/a&gt; (Hours are in Central European Summer time).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/04/48766199826_c0187b9999_c.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;533&quot; src=&quot;https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/04/48766199826_c0187b9999_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-329088&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mathieu Viet (@imath / me!) explaining BP contribution during &lt;a href=&quot;https://paris.wordcamp.org/2019/contributor-day/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;WC Paris Contributor day in 2019&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;span id=&quot;more-329085&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;bp-suggestions-mention&quot; href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/members/imath/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;@imath&lt;/a&gt; will be there to lead the BuddyPress contributing squad and we&amp;#8217;ll have a lot of work! As we&amp;#8217;re currently working on a very ambitious 12.0 release which main goal is to migrate from our Legacy URL parser to using the WordPress Rewrite API, there are many areas getting your contributions would really help us &amp;amp; make a huge difference! Below are the most important tasks we need to accomplish:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4954&quot;&gt;BP Rewrites merge process&lt;/a&gt; is still in progress&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Code: we need to build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buddypress/bp-classic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;BP Classic back compatibility plugin&lt;/a&gt; to give end users a plan B if some of their plugins are not ready yet when 12.0 will be released.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Documentation: we need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.buddypress.org/plugins/&quot;&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; third party Plugin/Theme developers what they need to do to make their work progressively &amp;#8220;BP Rewrites&amp;#8221; ready.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Documentation: we need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://codex.buddypress.org/&quot;&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; end-users how the switch we&amp;#8217;re performing will improve their BuddyPress experience (customizable slugs, plain text link compatibility&amp;#8230;).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Support: we need to have some most common troubleshoot replies ready in order to face the questions or requests for help we&amp;#8217;ll probably receive into our &lt;a href=&quot;https://buddypress.org/support/&quot;&gt;support forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you do not have a chance to attend IRL to this contributor day, no worries: you can virtually join us to get involved into these tasks going into our &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/buddypress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Slack channel&lt;/a&gt; on April 20, 2023 from &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20230420T0815&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;08:15 UTC&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20230420T1530&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;15:30 UTC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s contribute to BuddyPress!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: WooCommerce 7.6 Introduces Single Product Details Block and âAdd to Cartâ Form Block</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=143628</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-7-6-introduces-single-product-details-block-and-add-to-cart-form-block</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/04/13/woocommerce-7-6-released/&quot;&gt;WooCommerce 7.6&lt;/a&gt; was released today with two new blocks merged from the WooCommerce Blocks plugin. The Single Product Details block and the &amp;#8220;Add to Cart&amp;#8221; Form block are now available to store owners who want to use the Site Editor to design their own Single Product Templates. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with the button, the &amp;#8220;Add to Cart&amp;#8221; form block will automatically display additional options, depending on if the product has a set available quantity or variations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img /&gt;image credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/04/13/woocommerce-7-6-released/&quot;&gt;WooCommerce 7.6 release post&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In templates where store owners are displaying multiple products, attributes filtering has been improved for the Products block. Inside the editor, there is now a collapsible menu for selecting attributes and filtering the display. It also shows a live preview of the products that will be included in this view.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those who are designing pages and templates with patterns, WooCommerce 7.6 makes it much easier to get a consistent design with improved, scalable margins for patterns using the Products block.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This release also improves the Mini Cart block&amp;#8217;s performance, with content preloaded, and an appearance that more closely matches the site&amp;#8217;s active theme.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WooCommerce 7.6 includes several important updates for developers, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clearer, renamed event names in block-based Checkout&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reintroduced cache for orders (after it was reverted due to causing an infinite loop on activation) when custom tables are enabled &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Added an encoding selector to the product importer&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Add/Remove order coupon actions are now logged in notes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Products widget can now be sorted by menu_order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a more detailed look at the 673 commits in 7.6, check out the full &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/release/7.6/plugins/woocommerce/readme.txt&quot;&gt;changelog&lt;/a&gt;, which references each pull request included in the release. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WooCommerce has also released its &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/04/13/woocommerce-contributor-day-guide/&quot;&gt;Contributor Day Guide&lt;/a&gt; today for the upcoming 24-hour virtual event on April 19, 2023. There are instructions for how to get your development environment set up for contributing and how to join the Woo Community Slack. The guide outlines specific topics and tickets that will be addressed, with dedicated Slack channels for each.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In this conversation, they share their experiences and challenges in creating the plugin, including the importance of user feedback and testing. They also talk about their decision to make the plugin open-source, the potential benefits of doing so, and the importance of community involvement in the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poststatus.com/planet/feed/#h-transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript&lt;/a&gt; â&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this episode, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/corymiller303&quot;&gt;Cory Miller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/coreymaass&quot;&gt;Corey Maass&lt;/a&gt; share their insights and experience about the challenges of finding the right balance between simplicity and complexity and the importance of testing and documentation. They also share their personal stories of how they got started with WordPress and how their experiences have shaped their approach to plugin development. For anyone interested in developing WordPress plugins, especially if you are looking to improve your development process and create more user-friendly plugins, this episode is a must-listen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Takeaways:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a successful plugin requires a deep understanding of user needs and pain points: &lt;/strong&gt;Understanding your users&amp;#8217; needs and pain points to develop a plugin that solves their problems effectively is critical. This requires continuous user testing and feedback to improve functionality and user experience.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration and communication are crucial for plugin development: &lt;/strong&gt;Plugin development is a team effort that requires effective communication, collaboration, and project management. Clear communication channels, regular meetings, and shared project management tools help ensure everyone is on the same page.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monetization strategies should align with user value: &lt;/strong&gt;Considering various monetization strategies for plugins, including premium features, subscriptions, and sponsorships, is helpful. Your chosen strategy should align with the user&amp;#8217;s value proposition and offer a fair exchange of value. Being transparent with users about the plugin&amp;#8217;s monetization strategy and how it impacts their experience is important for successful adoption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;eplus-wrapper wp-block-heading&quot; id=&quot;h-transcript&quot;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h2 class=&quot;wp-block-heading&quot;&gt;Session 9 Corey &amp;amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; [00:00:00] So we&amp;#8217;ll also, um, so re read me as the, the big one?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. I think that&amp;#8217;s what we cover today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. So we&amp;#8217;ll also, uh, okay. All right. Could you hear me?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Uh, first I can, yeah. Oh, okay. The echo you mean? Yeah. Yeah. The same thing. Mute it. Yeah. Open up YouTube and then close YouTube. But I, I keep the comments open if anybody&amp;#8217;s weighing in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All right, Corey, this is session nine and we talked last week and we made the decision that we&amp;#8217;re gonna be one this with a couple change. And call it good for now and move on to another [00:01:00] project, um, let it sit and simmer a little bit. Um, so any thoughts that you had based on last week or anything else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I, I guess I just, I, I&amp;#8217;m glad that we&amp;#8217;re doing this, like I, and, and if for the, for the, the six people watching, You know, but hi, in historically this will be significant. You know, this is where we, uh, figured out how to make our millions. Right. Um, right. But I, I have had a lot of success not in a, in a project sense in the past of letting things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Uh, and so I definitely like, cuz we could keep banging away at Crop Express, adding more features. And there&amp;#8217;s still a few things that I wanna add. Like, I definitely wanna put a bow on it. Um, and I definitely think that it&amp;#8217;s something for [00:02:00] us to talk about, promote, you know, we&amp;#8217;ll send copies to, um, blogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like let&amp;#8217;s still have some of those conversations that, um, you talked about. As much because I want to talk to those people. I think it&amp;#8217;d be fun. Um, but I also think that it takes the pressure off of us like, you know, Having this, having this thing and going, okay, what, what&amp;#8217;s happening with it today?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s hap when Sometimes you just honestly need some time to go by. Um, and some people to mess with it and some people do mess with it enough to say, oh man, I wish it did this. And then, and then still ha use it for two more days before they finally do send us an email that&amp;#8217;s like, okay, hey, I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about this for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boy, I wish it did this, you know? Just because we&amp;#8217;re thinking a lot about it doesn&amp;#8217;t mean anybody else&amp;#8217;s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And I think there&amp;#8217;s two things when you&amp;#8217;re saying that came to mind is the get something [00:03:00] out, sit on it a bit, let it just kind of cook or just kind of be Yeah. I think it&amp;#8217;s interesting. And then, um, is, is great for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then second is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I forgot what I was gonna say. Um, but the second is we have the feedback loop, right. Um, within the plugin. So, you know, we, we never know. Um, might be something I think we, we felt like there was something. Better to chase that. We discovered through this, which I look at product as discovery, you know, especially our product, you know, when you got a working product and you&amp;#8217;re just adding things, that&amp;#8217;s way easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, working product, meaning people are paying money for it in my mind. Um, we already know it&amp;#8217;s functional and works. Um, but yeah, and I think, you know, just to talk about our decision for a second, we saw. More [00:04:00] opportunity on another direction that we discovered something you&amp;#8217;d been working on in parallel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, we&amp;#8217;re not ready to talk about that just yet cause we wanna get some things going, but I think that&amp;#8217;s part of the product trail is, you know, discovery, what&amp;#8217;s over the next mountain. And I don&amp;#8217;t know about you, but I go, I gotta put multiple things in the. To see what actually hits. Oh, yeah. Um, I, I feel like you and I built enough of a case for the other thing that, um, is really interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It seems like there&amp;#8217;s something there. So coming back to the cycle of like, okay, we&amp;#8217;d like this. We think this would be good. Mm-hmm. Other people, you know, would help. Um, anyway, I don&amp;#8217;t wanna get off on that for a second, but I did wanna at least unpack a little bit of our decision. You know, Colin v1 with a couple of these tweaks, um, good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And all that, and say, it&amp;#8217;s always a safari. Yes. [00:05:00]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. And I, you know, I, it&amp;#8217;s an ongoing conversation, I think is the other good metaphor. It&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s literal for, in our case, but it&amp;#8217;s also a good metaphor that as you talk, you uncover more things. You go, oh, I didn&amp;#8217;t think about this. And it&amp;#8217;s, um, so I guess the analogy too is, Concepts have to simmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ideas have to simmer, you know, the cadence of you and I chatting once a week, you know, occasionally a little bit more, but, uh, gives us a chance to go, okay, so this happened this week where this new other thing came out this week where this new, um, you know, product caught my eye that isn&amp;#8217;t related, but it sparked an idea, dot, dot, dot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like it&amp;#8217;s, you know, trying to, trying to get it all done, you know, hackathon. Is a neat exercise, but I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s the, the true arc of, of most products journeys. So, um, but I definitely, [00:06:00] oh, the one thing that I didn&amp;#8217;t tell you about is I did get my first email from crop.express, the website of somebody asking specifically, I have a client website, they need the image to be exactly these pixel proportions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So not even an aspect ratio. And uh, I was like, oh, okay. You know, so I think that I, I want to think about again, as we&amp;#8217;re talking about sort of putting a bow on v1 uh, accounting for that situation, and then to me that kind of, again, we&amp;#8217;ve, we&amp;#8217;ve completed a. Product. It solves the problem. It solves the problem everywhere that we think that it matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, it solves the problem for all of the scenarios that we currently know about. And this is where, like you said, we&amp;#8217;re wait, waiting for feedback. We&amp;#8217;re waiting for people to say, oh, hey, you know, aspect ratio [00:07:00] isn&amp;#8217;t really what I need, but I need is image or is pixel size. Uh, which technically can be done in the, I had added bin and max pixel stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like I, I think, you know, kind of like your feedback last week, like this settings page is the advanced settings, or it feels, you know, um, it feels like a 200 level class or whatever. Um, And so, you know, looking at simplifying that, but then, uh, yeah, letting it, letting it ride. Um, and, and at that point, like I said, I&amp;#8217;m really excited about getting it at actually installing it onto my client&amp;#8217;s websites and going, all right, Guinea pigs dance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You now have to use my plugin. But I&amp;#8217;ve, even, this week it came up again where, um, one of my clients was like, you know, trying to, trying to get an image. Onto the site correctly. And I had to walk her through some stuff. It&amp;#8217;s like, don&amp;#8217;t mention the plugin yet. Don&amp;#8217;t mention the [00:08:00] plugin yet, but as soon as I introduce it and walk them through it, you know, so I think it&amp;#8217;ll solve problems for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, a absolutely. Um, it, this whole conversation, and this relates to crop express now,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;uh, made me think of. But also kudos for like a, you, you saw an opportunity there with your client, like, so that&amp;#8217;s like the validation of, you know, is this, is this a valuable thing? Mm-hmm. You&amp;#8217;ve seen this a bunch of times where I wanted to share for anybody that&amp;#8217;s listened later is I always come back to this, so it seems like, like I&amp;#8217;ve majored in the pains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, specifically with utility software in the past. The thing that&amp;#8217;s really always compelling to me is gains. And I know you worked at O Opt Montreal at one point and I go, that was my classic example. We did utility things that [00:09:00] I themes and you know, you look at the gain, you look at like an e-commerce site or something, a marketing software or something like that, and it&amp;#8217;s like that&amp;#8217;s, I haven&amp;#8217;t really camped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Had a product. I don&amp;#8217;t think that camps out in the gain side. Yeah. Um, but I think we&amp;#8217;ve been doing this work too, is coming back to who is our customer for this. Mm-hmm. Whether it&amp;#8217;s ourselves for sure. And then we&amp;#8217;re developing out the profile for there. Like could this be something that&amp;#8217;s something when we start and talk about the next project publicly, um, so that we can, that&amp;#8217;s something I want to do better is go, okay, let&amp;#8217;s identify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The person that might have this problem or frustration or issue. This is a whole concept I&amp;#8217;m trying to get to. What&amp;#8217;s the amount of pain? Somebody goes, I&amp;#8217;ll pay for it. What&amp;#8217;s the amount of gain? Somebody goes, I&amp;#8217;ll pay for it. You know? Yep. That&amp;#8217;s [00:10:00] some of my learning as I&amp;#8217;ve gone, is gone. Okay. Like when we created backup buddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, the de the developer goes, Hey, I think we should, WordPress needs a holistic backup solution. And I was like, I just go, yeah, because a hundred percent theoretical market at that time. Um, so it&amp;#8217;s pretty easy. I think WordPress has got enough things out there. It&amp;#8217;s interesting from a competitive standpoint is where&amp;#8217;s that ideal place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, I don&amp;#8217;t know, I wanna throw some of that up to you and see if you had any comments. Cause you always have something really help. Uh, that changes my perspective a little bit, but it&amp;#8217;s like this balance, this is a formula for how products and services, different things get up and then, you know, nailing that customer, they go, oh man, that, that would, you know, when you get that feeling of like, oh, this would help me so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s the magic right there. Yeah.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; And. [00:11:00] I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m definitely, I&amp;#8217;ve also had some similar thoughts in that it&amp;#8217;s, it is a, I think, a slightly different way of thinking about product. Right. And the looking for pain is a very popular, um, Hundred level, I guess. Apparently I&amp;#8217;m making college analogies today. Um, but like you look at, um, Amy Hoy, Justin Jackson, uh, Rob Walling, like the, the startup thought leaders, um, who put out a lot of great content and have done for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Arguably, um, the, the thinking for a long time has been okay. You are an aspir. Probably solopreneur. You are a entrepreneur, and I don&amp;#8217;t mean that negatively, but the, like you are an aspiring, uh, you, you have an entrepreneurial spirit without [00:12:00] experience, right? So you, you&amp;#8217;re, you want to start your entrepreneur journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, and, uh, a very popular formula to start with because honestly, I think. I know it&amp;#8217;s generally more reliable as a beginner, um, is pain. And so there&amp;#8217;s all these ideas about like, okay, you get on a forum for fishermen where all the fishermen are talking and you kind of listen to their conversations and, and when they keep talking about like, boy at dawn I wish I had, you know, a certain kind of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s where you go, ah, That&amp;#8217;s a pain. Now I can go try to solve it. Um, which is very different from, oh, I&amp;#8217;m now, I&amp;#8217;m blanking on the name. Um, but there was, um, a product that came out years ago and it just [00:13:00] popped up on my radar again. Oh, Prezi. P r e z I. Mm-hmm. I think, right?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Mm-hmm. Yeah. I remember Prezi,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; that was a hundred percent a solution, looking for a.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was a really neat, in, in, I mean, we still have the slides paradigm, the, you know, uh, PowerPoint, Google presentation paradigm, rectangle, rectangle, rectangle. And Prezi had this really neat software that they built online, which was very impressive at the time, cuz again, it was probably 10 years ago, but where you had a, it was kind of like a, an interactive mind map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so you had a point that had something. Concept off of it. And you&amp;#8217;d zoom around, you&amp;#8217;d sort of fly around this, this presentation and it was extremely novel. But I think every person built one presentation in it and was like, this is neat, but it&amp;#8217;s very clear that I&amp;#8217;m using this software cuz it does one thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, and they did a really good [00:14:00] job, I think, of marketing and finding a use for this and marketing it, but they. Couldn&amp;#8217;t become the presentation standard that they&amp;#8217;d hoped to because they changed. It was too specific, you know? Um, and that&amp;#8217;s always the fear. It&amp;#8217;s definitely more fun sometimes. Um, and I&amp;#8217;ve definitely built a lot of products that were a concept and it was like, oh, I think I have a different way of approaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Uh, you know, project management to-do lists, time tracking the standard paradigms, but like, uh, instead of it being a vertical list, you know, it&amp;#8217;s horizontal or whatever the, whatever, it&amp;#8217;s, um, and I think that it&amp;#8217;s you, it&amp;#8217;s then tough because if you&amp;#8217;re, if you&amp;#8217;re on one end of the spectrum, you can, you can only present gain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like Prezi, where it&amp;#8217;s a, where it&amp;#8217;s, I hate to use the word gimmick, [00:15:00] but where it&amp;#8217;s, again, a, a prob a solution looking for a problem that&amp;#8217;s dangerous, that&amp;#8217;s very, very difficult to change a paradigm. Like they did not change the way all presentations are. Look, they couldn&amp;#8217;t. Um, and then on the other end of the spectrum, you know, what we&amp;#8217;ve, what we&amp;#8217;ve talking about is, um, a hundred percent solving for a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s. Fishermen need a flashlight at dawn, build the flashlight. You&amp;#8217;re done. And so what we start talking about is somewhere in the middle. Um, and it&amp;#8217;s, and it, again, I think just a different way of, of thinking, uh, it&amp;#8217;s gonna be more challenging for you, marketing it, more challenging for both of us or anybody to talk about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, if it isn&amp;#8217;t a problem that people are already trying to solve. And I think what we&amp;#8217;re, you know, I do, I do anticipate landing [00:16:00] somewhere in the middle, like crop Express I think is a good example of, it&amp;#8217;s definitely a pain, but people are solving it by going elsewhere. They&amp;#8217;re going to Photoshop, they&amp;#8217;re going to crop.express, and we&amp;#8217;re kind of bringing it to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, and so I think that I, I hope to still kind of do some of that stuff. Um, but then also, You know, maybe introduce concepts that, that WordPress doesn&amp;#8217;t currently have, paradigms that, that WordPress doesn&amp;#8217;t currently, uh, have its arms around. And so I&amp;#8217;m kinda excited for all that. It&amp;#8217;s also, I think it being more on that spectrum, it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s more creative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s more fun for us.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah. So yeah, a absolutely. You know, we, it seems like we&amp;#8217;re using that whole thing is build something for yourself. And we&amp;#8217;re using problems we see for ourselves using the new [00:17:00] thing we&amp;#8217;re talking about, using word pr, um, post status and your clients and things. And it makes me think like the game pain conversation on that when we show that we can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What I wrote down when, when we, just a minute ago was, you know, in the classic consulting bible, I think it&amp;#8217;s Alan Weiss, he talks about the job of a consultant is to improve the client&amp;#8217;s condition. Mm-hmm. In some way. Mm-hmm. And I&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot of thoughts about consulting cause I&amp;#8217;ve tried it a couple of times and, uh, have failed miserably at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, uh, I&amp;#8217;m still trying. And, but from the. From that consulting thing. If you think about that just for a second, you&amp;#8217;re like, how do I help improve the client&amp;#8217;s condition, or in this case, our potential customer&amp;#8217;s condition? And I think we&amp;#8217;ve done a lot of that work in Crop Express is precisely thinking about the outcome they&amp;#8217;re wanting.[00:18:00]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, uh, I&amp;#8217;ll save the rest for our, for our next conversation. But, um, so I. Anything you learned, and I know we still need to do the readme, but, um, anything takeaways from what we&amp;#8217;ve done so far? Other takeaways?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; I, in a, to be honest, I do think that we have, I&amp;#8217;m thinking out loud here, so I, I, I reserve the right to take all of this back. Um, but at least some. The process that we&amp;#8217;re going through, have gone through is the same, uh, falls in the same trap in that I do think that we have, we know there&amp;#8217;s a problem. We, we&amp;#8217;ve had the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#8217;t like how, um, propping and inserting images into WordPress currently [00:19:00] works. Um, we. Got excited and said, okay, there&amp;#8217;s something here. We both felt, you know, felt it in our gut, but then as we got into it, there&amp;#8217;s definitely been, I don&amp;#8217;t, it&amp;#8217;s not like I expect, you know, a million news, a million installs overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, but there&amp;#8217;s, there&amp;#8217;s something, I don&amp;#8217;t know what we could have done differently, but they&amp;#8217;re, I haven&amp;#8217;t felt. The spark didn&amp;#8217;t ignite, I guess is what I&amp;#8217;m, kinda what I would say. It&amp;#8217;s like there&amp;#8217;s something here. We&amp;#8217;ve built a nice little utility. I almost, it almost feels like we&amp;#8217;ve kind of, uh, you know, we, we saw a sparkle of something on the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We started digging. There might have been a couple of other glimmers of like, oh, there&amp;#8217;s a, maybe a li a hint of gold. It kept us digging, but I kind of feel like we&amp;#8217;ve reached a point where, You know, we&amp;#8217;ve dug around, we&amp;#8217;ve dug up all the earth around what we thought might have been a vein of gold and said, okay, [00:20:00] yeah, no, I guess there&amp;#8217;s nothing here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, and not that that isn&amp;#8217;t part of the process. Um, I don&amp;#8217;t know what we could have done differently. I, I only question if there was a way to have arrived there sooner. Um, mm-hmm. And again, none of this is to say that I don&amp;#8217;t think that what we&amp;#8217;ve created has value. Um, and we kept sort of going, okay, well let&amp;#8217;s, you know, we keep having really good high level conversations, which again, has led to other ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, and so that&amp;#8217;s, that&amp;#8217;s not invaluable. Um, but we were sort of like, take a step forward and see, take a step forward and see. And now that we&amp;#8217;re ready to kind of put a bow on version one, it&amp;#8217;s like, yeah, this might be. You know, which is okay. Um, but it&amp;#8217;s very, it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s a, it&amp;#8217;s definitely a little hard to accept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Do you know what I mean? Like just [00:21:00] the sunk cost fallacy or whatever it is. Like you Yeah. We&amp;#8217;ve put in time and effort and, and so much thinking that we, we, part of me still really wants it to be something more than what it may. You know, and I know, and this, this conversation may be just as in, um, as premature as, uh, as what I&amp;#8217;m alluding to, right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of like, early on we were very optimistic that we would find something bigger down the road anyway. So I have a thought&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; I, on that thought. I have, I have a thought for when we go to the next conversation. Hmm. Um, how we could maybe approach that even better.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; But I guess I like what I do like is the meta, um, the meta of you and I recording all of these conversations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right. And I think, like, I remember one, one of the, a a, a mental image, but a [00:22:00] conversation, a memory that, that often pops into my head is when I still worked at we. Um, yes, the one that&amp;#8217;s in the documentary, you can see my bald spot in, in the back of some of the shots, um, where they talk about, you know, the demise of, of WeWork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, so yeah, I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m WeWork famous. Um, but, uh, at the time I sat at the table with, uh, five other entrepreneurs, everybody pursuing different projects and it was great because it was an an instant mastermind and very frequently we. Just say, Hey, could I, you know, buy you lunch and, and pick your brain about such and such?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I remember a buddy of mine, Joel, coming to a real crossroads in, uh, in product and in business. Um, and again, him saying, Hey, could I just, could we take a walk? I&amp;#8217;m like, you know, vexed about this and [00:23:00] we. Uh, in soho and we walked over to the river and just like standing at the railing and looking at, um, what, what would it have been, um, the Hudson River and looking over to New Jersey and him talking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And there was this moment of me just feeling very, this is, this is feeling very grown up and very, like, we were having important conversations and, um, You know, and it, it felt great that I hopefully was helping him work through some problems and stuff. But, um, anyway, uh, the value in that experience, that camaraderie and, and then ultimately, like there were other conversations where he helped me just as much as maybe I helped him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, but I&amp;#8217;m hoping that at a high level, even though you and I like session seven, whatever this is, we, we are where we are. It is where it isn&amp;#8217;t, where we expect it to. We are going to continue, but I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m hoping that people watching this are having some of that same, like, [00:24:00] oh, other people have these, these thoughts or go around in these circles or, you know, ramble to themselves just like I do&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I, I think so many times, uh, I&amp;#8217;m not just, I don&amp;#8217;t wake up born with a gift of know. What the pro products are. Um, I&amp;#8217;ve gotta figure it out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Ands am working with you, man. I know. I, I was counting on million dollar idea overnight, the magic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Um, you know, and uh, so I&amp;#8217;ve done a lot of thinking about products for the last 15 years, obviously, and gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okay. You get, so I think we&amp;#8217;re pulling together some components, comparing experiences too, and. Plowing the new head forward. Um, so yeah, I mean, the camaraderie&amp;#8217;s been amazing. I do it just for that. But second is I think we&amp;#8217;re building some experience about what products work, what, what products don&amp;#8217;t. I, I think there&amp;#8217;s a tendency for me is think [00:25:00] people do have magic and just know it, but there&amp;#8217;s, there&amp;#8217;s, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of things that go into that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And there&amp;#8217;s a lot of. Professionally about this particular topic, but there&amp;#8217;s a reason why comp big companies buy smaller companies because they found the magic and they were pulled in, you know, kind of thing. Um, at least that&amp;#8217;s how I think about it in my humility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, and so I, in the last few years have learned to make things around my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I. My carpentry skills are getting better. I&amp;#8217;m not good. But, uh, I have now, you know, built a big roof over my patio. I&amp;#8217;ve built shelves, I&amp;#8217;ve, you know, um, helped my father-in-law fix his roof, stuff like that. Um, and I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;ve definitely had the experience where I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m working generally with people who know what they&amp;#8217;re.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But not always. [00:26:00] Uh, I have, I can always jump on YouTube and, and Google things. Um, but I definitely felt the, so a little, a little insight to me like. Years and years ago, I was an artistic genius. Um, in my own mind, absolutely. Like I was, uh, a musician. I still am. I was starting to build product. I still do, but at the time I was convi, utterly convinced that I&amp;#8217;m very smart and I will, I can, I can figure out magic, um, and, uh, an aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Turning middle-aged or whatever it is, is like, I&amp;#8217;m just another human. And yes, I might do some amazing things. Um, but most humans in one sense or another, do some amazing things. Um, but everybody also, everybody has to start from somewhere. And a lot of the times it&amp;#8217;s a group of people. And so, uh, going back to like learning how to repair or I, I got to be, [00:27:00] I was, uh, helped a bunch of people literally build a house in a.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. And the, the, the, in the crew, it was a dad and some son, his sons all work construction, all build houses, so they know how to knock together, literally knock together a house in a day. And I had no idea how to knock together a house in a day. Um, And so they are amazing at what they do now from experience, and they are smart people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, and then that gets shared with the rest of us. There&amp;#8217;s this trickle down, and I&amp;#8217;m not saying I could go build a house in a day, but at least I have some sense of how it is done. And so this summer when I build a shed, I might be able to build a shed with a couple of other people in a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know what I mean? Mm-hmm. Um, and so there&amp;#8217;s, there&amp;#8217;s definitely. You know, we, we always talk about the Steve [00:28:00] Jobs or the whoever, um, you know, the artistic geniuses. The, the people who can snap their fingers and, and creativity comes out, and then the rest of us have to work at it, you know? And, and that&amp;#8217;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s, it&amp;#8217;s a little bit of luck and it&amp;#8217;s a little bit of timing and it&amp;#8217;s a little bit of the people around you, and it&amp;#8217;s a little bit of the industry you&amp;#8217;re in. And then it&amp;#8217;s the practice that you&amp;#8217;ve done. And you and I have both been thinking about product for, you know, 15 years or whatever it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so I&amp;#8217;m walking around, I&amp;#8217;m in San Francisco this week, so I&amp;#8217;m walking around in San Francisco thinking, The amount of, you know, tech and, and whatnot that&amp;#8217;s here. Um, but what it really comes down to is like, I was driving on the highway last night. Judging harshly, all of the ridiculous billboards, because I&amp;#8217;m like, who is Twilio think they&amp;#8217;re advertising to?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or who is, um, who else did we see monday.com? And I&amp;#8217;m not necessarily picking on their billboards. They&amp;#8217;re fine. But it&amp;#8217;s like, [00:29:00] okay, th this is, these, these is, this isn&amp;#8217;t, that&amp;#8217;s most of these products I don&amp;#8217;t think. Attributable to one person&amp;#8217;s genius. These are products that were built by teams and companies that were built up over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#8217;s a marketing team, and now I&amp;#8217;m questioning some of the marketing decisions, but I&amp;#8217;m like, who are they marketing to? You know? And how does that differ from like the online billboards ads and such that I&amp;#8217;m seeing when I&amp;#8217;m in New Hampshire versus in. You know, I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m essentially in Silicon Valley, you know, so it&amp;#8217;s, uh, humbling, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I mean, they&amp;#8217;re exp spending tens of thousands on billboards that I think are not very good. Um, but at the same time, they&amp;#8217;ve arrived there over time, you know? And did it start with conversations like this? Did it, you know, who was the team involved? Who were the people involved? What were their experience?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;#8217;s all fascinating. I wish most [00:30:00] companies. There was just a, a thread on Hacker News. Um, was it Hack News or Reddit? Like what are your favorite postmortems? Um, and it&amp;#8217;s, I, I like the people on that thread were wishing that they were more write-ups of, um, You know, there&amp;#8217;s probably a little bit of morbid curiosity, um, but also like, you know, what are the lessons we can learn, but also a, a lot of it&amp;#8217;s just the stories are fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a reason why there&amp;#8217;s 101 podcasts interviewing founders, many of whom haven&amp;#8217;t reached the success that most of us would, would want, themselves included. Um, but the stories are fascinating, you know.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it, it, I&amp;#8217;ve, I read the founders at workbook and it was really cool, but, and a lot of it is serendipity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And it&amp;#8217;s like, I was gonna use a band analogy cuz of your music background [00:31:00] and just go like, you know, how does. Um, I know some mu musicians and I&amp;#8217;m like, one pretty dang popular in the nineties, eighties and nineties. Mm-hmm. And, uh, spent some time with him. Really great guy, but I was like, I always wanna go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How did the, like he&amp;#8217;s played with that, his band for, you know, A long time and they&amp;#8217;ve had success together and it&amp;#8217;s like, how do you, how does that come together? Is always the magic for me. And then how do they make this great music that a lot of the best bands I&amp;#8217;ve heard, you know, they need, like Dave Matthews was the continuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;re like, man, great voice. But I&amp;#8217;ve also heard like he wouldn&amp;#8217;t be Dave Matthews and Dave Matthews band without all the incredible musicians around him. He happens to get the names stands,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; the connections he had and stuff like that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that was very much, iThemes , by the way, I got way more credit and I can&amp;#8217;t sing so[00:32:00]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; well. But um, yeah, and I think that, thank you. I think you&amp;#8217;ve sort of. In some ways summarized what, what I, my rambling was trying to get at is the, it&amp;#8217;s everything is the sum of its parts, right? And so it&amp;#8217;s like, there was a point where I thought that I would snap my fingers, um, and not that I didn&amp;#8217;t work really, really hard, um, but I now understand that it&amp;#8217;s so much more as the building blocks, the sum of the building blocks, um, and the culmination of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And like a lot of bands, you know, I love, in fact, I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m rereading Elton John&amp;#8217;s book. Um, great read by the way. I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of Elton John. I, when I read it the first time, I went back and literally tried to listen to some of his music and I couldn&amp;#8217;t get through most of it. It&amp;#8217;s just so not to my taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, I&amp;#8217;m wrong. Don&amp;#8217;t, there? There is no question that I am, I am wrong. Literally, [00:33:00] billions of people love his music and I don&amp;#8217;t, so I am wrong here. But the book is really fun. Um, well written self effacing. Self self deprecating. Um, and, and I&amp;#8217;m a music history nerd. Um, but it&amp;#8217;s the, you know how things came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, you know, and he definitely is magical, musically. Um, but he, he watch the past tense of grind grounded. He, he worked really, really hard for a really long time and with a lot of people, and people came and went and stuff like that, you know, so at some point you and I are. Reach a a point where you&amp;#8217;re gonna fire me and hire somebody better and keep going with the band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, and I will be the pee best. Um, you know, the long lost drummer, original drummer of the Beatles, um, who will die in obscurity. [00:34:00] And I accept,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#8217;t think so, cuz you, you, you forget. I don&amp;#8217;t know how to sing and it&amp;#8217;s not gonna be as fun at all without the drums and guitar solo and everything you&amp;#8217;ve done so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; But anyway, why don&amp;#8217;t, why don&amp;#8217;t you share your screen if you have the, the read me. I think, I feel like the brainstorming we did last time worked well. Like you were typing, typing, typing, um, while we were both chatting, if that works. Yep. So we&amp;#8217;re here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nice. Oh, so there&amp;#8217;s an edit option. That&amp;#8217;s cool. Uh, bottom left, there&amp;#8217;s a button that&amp;#8217;s an edit. Can we make our changes right in it? Cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; You know what, we&amp;#8217;ll wanna go back when we do the, the new brand that we talked about, we&amp;#8217;ll wanna come back and put the links here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, for sure. [00:35:00] Okay,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;so I go to, we&amp;#8217;re press. Slash plugins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and I search for crop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and I&amp;#8217;m seeing what else comes up. And like there&amp;#8217;s a, yeah, image aspect ratio. Custom fields for, um, a ACF crop and image as keywords. Um, I also heard from, I did a, um, a call with um, Matt Cromwell and, um, I hate to say it, but Leslie Pizza, um, cuz I can never remember her last name and I think she actually, like a lot of people call her Leslie Pizza.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, But, uh, they were helping me [00:36:00] review one of my other plugins and said that we can actually have up to 12 keywords. Uh, just the first, I think, five show up. So, uh, I was actually misinformed that, or I, under, I had the wrong knowledge that, uh, I thought we could only have a few keywords. So, um, I think on that, on that first screen, Plug in maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I saw tags. So, um,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;like I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m wondering if, I mean this is, and this is all always speculation, but is, is it better to have image crop or is it better to just have crop? To me, you don&amp;#8217;t crop, you don&amp;#8217;t crop anything that isn&amp;#8217;t an image. So I, it might ju we might, image, crop might be. Cropping is good though.[00:37:00]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; So I had crop and cropping. Since we can add more tags, that&amp;#8217;s good knowledge,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In WordPress, uh, featured images are often called thumbnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, oh, media library. Now that we have that, it&amp;#8217;s probably, you know, if people are looking for ways that they are manipulating images in the media library, maybe they search for media library.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, I can&amp;#8217;t imagine that people are looking for the term aspect. Um,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More likely they&amp;#8217;re looking for, oh, image size, right? Like we had the, the guy message me and say, I need, you know, I need [00:38:00] all images, need to ultimately be 700 by 500 or whatever it was, like image size. Um, so anyway, I feel like that flushes it out a lot more. Okay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s awesome. I mean, that&amp;#8217;s really good base level things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We gotta just check the box for. Uh, do I push saver update code? I&amp;#8217;m always the Control s. Control s. Command desk. Command desk, right.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Um, I probably save, I I imagine that Save actually does both. I just remember that Save took a long time. Okay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Um. Okay. I put cropping here and I put precise. I took out feature damages, but is there anything else you see that we should probably like a list of features maybe[00:39:00]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; I. So up to 150 characters, um, I&amp;#8217;m still looking at the description first. Um, it seems like, uh, do you have a, something that&amp;#8217;ll tell us how many characters we&amp;#8217;re using there? Go stick it in a fake tweet or something though. So I guess they just give you. A counter,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think like, so I do, I [00:40:00] think we could just say crop images in WordPress Z or is that a sentence? It&amp;#8217;s awesome. I think that&amp;#8217;s really good. WordPress easily, but I, I guess my point is I, we&amp;#8217;re not using 150 characters. Let&amp;#8217;s, let&amp;#8217;s add more words. Um, and WordPress easier. Dash featured image media library.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, it&amp;#8217;s a little bit of, um, keyword.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I mean, we had the block too. Mm-hmm. Prop images and WordPress.[00:41:00]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Uh,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;say Guttenberg block,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;like, um, image crop or guttenberg block. I just always feel like we need, I, I&amp;#8217;m not convinced that people. Only at like truly think of it, it&amp;#8217;s just the block editor. Do you know what I mean? Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:42:00] Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Probably have all these memorized, but I was gonna go back into the plugin. So we have mm-hmm. Go ahead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Um, just the, that we can, um, keyword stuff, the title too. So going back to the plugin tab, crop express,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;crop express, four featured images or, um,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m just trying to think of what the key, what the keywords might be like. Hmm. [00:43:00] I don&amp;#8217;t think we need WordPress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I was trying to say something like car is a,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;it keeps it native, I guess. Like you don&amp;#8217;t have to go outside of WordPress. There&amp;#8217;s a better term for that, I&amp;#8217;m sure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Right, but I guess this, this is more like, this is more search rankings. I literally think repeating Crop Express for featured images for media library for Gutenberg block. Um,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;yeah, I think, I think that that&amp;#8217;s, to me, that&amp;#8217;s what, what the purpose would be. It&amp;#8217;s, it doesn&amp;#8217;t hurt, like those are human readable words, but I do think it helps the seo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okay. [00:44:00] And I put block, I don&amp;#8217;t know how long this can be, right? Uh, I mean, short pixels is pretty long. Say what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am, I&amp;#8217;m comparing other ones in the repo and like short, short pixel image optimizer Dash Optimize Image is Convert WebP and a V I f. Like they&amp;#8217;re, they&amp;#8217;re, the title of theirs is 66 characters, so I feel like we&amp;#8217;re, we&amp;#8217;ve got room to play with.[00:45:00]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Uh, the sentence above, you can take out featured images, so crop express speeds up your content workflow. Uh, giving you uniform images for your blog post. I think you can take out featured because we now have expanded, but I still love this intro. Um, so even the title at the top, make cropping featured images you can take out featured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So making&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;that what you meant right here. Yeah, and, and again, that I think that could be similar to the short description. So rather than make cropping images, we could just say crop images easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yep. I think it&amp;#8217;s bad English, [00:46:00] but I think it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But I think, yeah, we define the problem, we define the high level solution well, and then talk about features, which is the formula you&amp;#8217;re kind of supposed to follow. Mm-hmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I would even add another one, uh, below that first one you just said. Say, um, something like, uh, round avatar images or something like that. Like shapes is shapes and down the road we can add [00:47:00] stars and rainbows and unicorns if we want. But you know, I still think that it&amp;#8217;s pretty amazing that you can crop a circle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Uh, yeah, there you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Love it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;and the set sizing defaults give. I don&amp;#8217;t know if guardrails communicate cross cultures, but um, to me it&amp;#8217;s like put those Boeing bumpers on your client, right? From like doing crappy stuff. So giving some, you&amp;#8217;re kind of making it easier on your client by giving them some base. You&amp;#8217;re, you&amp;#8217;re actually taking out the [00:48:00] possibility of error on the client you deliver work for by giving them some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So keep them for,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; um, Prevent uploading the wrong,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;wrong image, like it&amp;#8217;s really wrong size and shape image, but that&amp;#8217;s really wordy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Huge images that slow down your site. There you go. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Um, you could also, uh, another, you another new under the, the second item is, um, media library.[00:49:00]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Just throw things out just to get us going.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah, we&amp;#8217;ve got, at this point we&amp;#8217;ve got the three integration points, featured images, media library, and Gutenberg block. Um, and then we&amp;#8217;ve got settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:50:00] Settings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Got the block you said, I&amp;#8217;m sorry. Feature damage image and then the standalone block? Mm-hmm. Okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m just testing that. I don&amp;#8217;t know if it works. [00:51:00] I almost feel like putting this above here and then, you know, new, like the first one is the block. Yep. That&amp;#8217;s cool. It&amp;#8217;s in post copy images by sizes set. Image&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;three, need it. Let&amp;#8217;s see. I almost feel like this needs to be, I don&amp;#8217;t know. I don&amp;#8217;t want to nitpick it too much. Image sizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okay. Anything I missed?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; No, I think this is a great next version. Okay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Save it. Mm-hmm.[00:52:00]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Can you do custom ratios? Mm-hmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where already said that. See, so it&amp;#8217;s really a square circle or&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; you&amp;#8217;re accustom, right? I I feel like, I mean, it&amp;#8217;s circle, circle or anything else. So, um, pick the most pocket aspect ratios or create your own. Crop a circle if you want to kind of thing. Yeah, I mean they&amp;#8217;re, cuz they&amp;#8217;re all,[00:53:00]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;yeah, I think that&amp;#8217;s great. You&amp;#8217;re done. Okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now do you just need this? Yeah, so if you&amp;#8217;ve hit update code and it updated, uh, cuz I&amp;#8217;m not seeing our new tags in there, so I don&amp;#8217;t think we&amp;#8217;ve updated. Oh. Update code. There we go. There we go. Yeah. So send that to me and I&amp;#8217;ll, I&amp;#8217;ll drop it in. Cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Done. Great. Um, so I actually need to bounce. Okay. Um, But yeah, you send that to me. Uh, we&amp;#8217;ll plug that in. I&amp;#8217;ll upload it later today. And then, um, again, I I, there&amp;#8217;s a little bit of a long tail, there&amp;#8217;s a couple more the settings that we wanted to add and [00:54:00] stuff like that, but, um, you know, let&amp;#8217;s, again, I&amp;#8217;m, I&amp;#8217;m excited to kind of let it, let it simmer for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay. Sounds good to me. I&amp;#8217;m gonna put some notes about the next topic. In chat, um, just so that We&amp;#8217;ll, they&amp;#8217;ll be there and I won&amp;#8217;t lose them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corey Maass:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, yeah. I&amp;#8217;m sorry. I&amp;#8217;ve, I&amp;#8217;m, yeah, no problem. I&amp;#8217;m getting lost, but, um, yeah, we could also, let&amp;#8217;s, you know, let&amp;#8217;s schedule a call, uh, tomorrow, Friday, too. Okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sounds&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cory Miller:&lt;/strong&gt; good, man. Enjoy San Francisco.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>WPTavern: Yoast SEO 20.5 Drops Support for PHP 5.6, 7.0, and 7.1</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=143580</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/yoast-seo-20-5-drops-support-for-php-5-6-7-0-and-7-1</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-april-11-2023&quot;&gt;Yoast SEO 20.5&lt;/a&gt; was released this week with several security fixes and an improved Google SERP preview. The preview shows mobile and desktop snippets with Google&amp;#8217;s current styling so users can see exactly how their snippets will look and tweak how they optimize them for Google Search results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another highlight of this release is that Yoast SEO has dropped compatibility with PHP 5.6, 7.0 and 7.1. The plugin now requires PHP 7.2.5 or higher (along with WP 6.0). While this may seem extreme at first glance, approximately 89.9% of WordPress sites are running on PHP 7.2+. WordPress doesn&amp;#8217;t cross-reference these stats with WP version numbers, but it&amp;#8217;s possible sites running on much older versions of WordPress are also on unsupported versions of PHP.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;img /&gt;WordPress &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/stats/&quot;&gt;PHP Version Stats&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; 4/11/2023



&lt;p&gt;Getting WordPress sites to update to the latest versions of PHP is a slow-moving process, but historically Yoast SEO has been a force for change in pushing users to upgrade their PHP versions. In version 4.5, released in 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/yoast-seo-4-5-urges-users-to-upgrade-to-php-7&quot;&gt;Yoast SEO threw the weight of its estimated 6.5 million user base behind the movement to push hosts to upgrade their customers to PHP 7&lt;/a&gt;. That version of the plugin introduced a large, non-dismissible notice urging site administrators to upgrade to PHP 7.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;âTo move the web forward, we need to take a stand against old, slow, and unsafe software,&amp;#8221; Yoast founder Joost de Valk said at that time. âBecause web hosts are not upgrading PHP, we have decided to start pushing this from within plugins.&amp;#8221; He contended that the WordPress ecosystem was losing good developers because the project was moving too slowly and also made the case for security and speed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the latest version 20.5 will be incompatible with approximately 10% of WordPress sites running unsupported versions of PHP, this move forward is necessary for maintaining a healthy and secure ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: WordPress Gears Up for 2nd Women and Nonbinary Release Squad</title>
	<guid>https://wptavern.com/?p=143582</guid>
	<link>https://wptavern.com/wordpress-gears-up-for-2nd-women-and-nonbinary-release-squad</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy is &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/04/07/preparing-for-the-next-women-nonbinary-release-squad/&quot;&gt;coordinating a second women and nonbinary release squad&lt;/a&gt; for the 6.4 release, which is anticipated to land in &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/&quot;&gt;November 2023&lt;/a&gt;. In 2020, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-6-simone-includes-new-twenty-twenty-one-theme-and-improved-editor&quot;&gt;WordPress 5.6 &amp;#8220;Simone&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; was led by an all-women and non-binary identifying release squad, a first in WordPress&amp;#8217; history, and Haden Chomphosy is proposing the project go for it again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Having a release squad comprised of folx we donât typically see in technology also has a goal of increasing the number of underrepresented people who have experience maintaining, managing, and shipping software in anÂ open sourceÂ project,&amp;#8221; Haden Chomphosy said. &amp;#8220;All contributions to the release and release process are welcome.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WordPress 6.3, which is targeted for a mid-July release, will give prospective 6.4 squad members the opportunity to shadow more experienced contributors and gain new skills by working with mentors and assisting with the release. She is calling for mentors to join in preparing this new round of leaders. The process is a several-months long commitment that gives contributors a head start on understanding their roles in the squad, though it is not required for participation in the 6.4 release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Haden Chomphosy emphasized that anyone will be able to contribute to the release but the leaders in the 6.4 squad will be limited to this specific group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I short-hand the release to &amp;#8216;women and nonbinary&amp;#8217; for easy referencing in our day-to-day collaboration, but the release squad will be open to anyone who identifies as a woman, nonbinary, or gender-expansive,&amp;#8221; she said. &amp;#8220;All contributions are welcome as always, regardless of how you identify or what groups you feel part of.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;WordPress has gained valuable new contributors and leaders from this initiative in the past, including 6.2 Core Tech Co-Leads Tonya Mork.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Before joining the 5.6 Release Squad, I hadÂ &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;Â contributed to the project,&amp;#8221; Mork said. &amp;#8220;I had no idea how the release cycle worked or where to start. Yup, I was a contributing noob. But with mentoring, I wasÂ &lt;em&gt;well supported&lt;/em&gt;Â in my onboarding.Â &lt;em&gt;And you will be too! The experience was and still is incredible!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on the response to Haden Chomphosy&amp;#8217;s proposal, there should be no shortage of contributors and volunteers available to help with the women and nonbinary 6.4 release squad. She is requesting anyone who wants to be part of the squad or help as a mentor leading up to the release to leave a comment on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/04/07/preparing-for-the-next-women-nonbinary-release-squad/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<title>WPTavern: #71 â Nathan Ingram on How To Manage Contracts With Your WordPress Clients</title>

	<description>Transcription&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[00:00:00] Nathan Wrigley: Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case how to manage your website client contracts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you have a topic that you&amp;#8217;d like us to feature on the show, I&amp;#8217;m very keen to hear from you and hopefully get you or your idea on the podcast as soon as possible. Head over to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So on the podcast today, we have Nathan Ingram. Nathan is the host at iThemes Training, where he teaches WordPress and business development topics via live webinar. Based in Birmingham, Alabama, he has been working with clients to build websites since 1995.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#8217;s also the creator of MonsterContracts, which helps WordPress professionals create contracts for their client work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve worked directly with clients, then you&amp;#8217;ll know that things don&amp;#8217;t always go according to plan. Assets might not be delivered on time. The client does not respond to your emails. The expectations of the client begins to creep away from the original proposal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whilst there&amp;#8217;s unlikely to be a perfect system to ensure that all projects run according to the plan, you can protect yourself from some of the worst aspects. And for this, you may need a contract.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nathan is on the podcast today to talk about why he thinks contracts are an essential part of any client facing WordPress work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We begin by talking about how the contract is designed as a tool to bring clarity to both parties. You, the website builder, can set out the constraints within which you work and the client can understand what they can, and cannot, expect from you. Nathan thinks that setting these expectations before the project begins leads to fewer problems later on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We talk about the fact that contracts don&amp;#8217;t need to contain overly complex legal language, but they do need to be checked by a qualified legal professional before they&amp;#8217;re deployed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nathan also explains how he&amp;#8217;s refined his contract over the years, tweaking the wording and the structure, depending upon the project at hand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We then get into what you can realistically do should your client breach the contract. Are you able to turn off their website, or withhold work that you&amp;#8217;ve completed? Nathan&amp;#8217;s not really in favour of sending in the lawyers as soon as something goes wrong. Rather trying to resolve any conflict through better communication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s an interesting conversation, which makes contracts seem less adversarial and more about ensuring that your WordPress website projects run as smoothly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&amp;#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so without further delay, I bring you Nathan Ingram.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am joined on the podcast by Nathan Ingram. Hello, Nathan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:04:07] Nathan Ingram: Hey Nathan, how are you?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:04:08] Nathan Wrigley: That&amp;#8217;s strange. I&amp;#8217;ve not had that before. Two Nathan&amp;#8217;s on the podcast today. Very different levels of experience in the subject that we&amp;#8217;re going to be talking about. Nathan Ingram is here today and he&amp;#8217;s going to be talking to us about the legal aspects of hiring clients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You might describe it in one word as contracts, I guess. And there&amp;#8217;s a whole treasure trove of things that we&amp;#8217;re going to unpack there. But before we do that, Nathan, if anybody hasn&amp;#8217;t heard of you before and hasn&amp;#8217;t seen the things that you are doing online, would you just spend a few minutes introducing yourself? You can go back as far as you like but, give us yourself in the WordPress context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:04:44] Nathan Ingram: Yeah, sure. So I&amp;#8217;ve been working with WordPress exclusively since right around 2010. I run a small agency down in Birmingham, Alabama. I&amp;#8217;ve been working with clients since 1995. So I&amp;#8217;ve been around the webspace for quite a while. I also am the host at iThemes Training. So we do live training webinars three days a week through iThemes. And then I also do some business coaching, and I have a product called MonsterContracts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:05:08] Nathan Wrigley: Tell us about the iThemes thing for a minute, because I know you do trainings over there. How did that all come about? Was it like a happy coincidence that you ended up doing that? Were you making content, training content, elsewhere that got you into that position?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:05:22] Nathan Ingram: No goodness. So it&amp;#8217;s really an interesting story and we could take a whole , a whole episode on how do people find their way in the WordPress community? So for me, iThemes was actually iThemes training at that time. Early on it was called webdesign.com. They had leased that really awesome domain name.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it was where I learned WordPress. At that point I was sort of in a, the Macromedia ecosystem, and I had resisted WordPress for quite a while. Decided this is coming and I&amp;#8217;ve got to go with the flow and move into WordPress, because a lot of my clients were looking for WordPress sites. Or sites they could log in and edit themselves. I found iThemes as a theme company, and the training went hand in hand, and that&amp;#8217;s where I learned WordPress. And gradually over time, I started presenting one or two webinars and then gradually rolled into the presenter role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:06:08] Nathan Wrigley: That&amp;#8217;s nice. And so you do that regularly, three times a week. You go live and give trainings about a whole range of different subjects, right?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:06:15] Nathan Ingram: Yeah, like just yesterday we did our monthly news roundup on iThemes training. So look at the news in the WordPress world. Particularly from the perspective of people who build and manage websites. That&amp;#8217;s really our audience on iThemes training. What news is important for people who do what I do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:06:29] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so that&amp;#8217;s really excellent. Unfortunately, it&amp;#8217;s not the topic that we&amp;#8217;re going to be talking about today. We&amp;#8217;re talking about one of the areas, I think in web design that really can cause the blue touch paper to be lit, and the firework to go off. This is the whole thing of relationships with clients and the boundaries that you set, and whether you should have contracts, and whether you should be getting involved with lawyers and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And there are very few parts of the business that I used to run, which would cause me to become upset, irritable, and in some cases quite angry. But relationships with clients could do that. It&amp;#8217;s quite unique, isn&amp;#8217;t it?.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:07:15] Nathan Ingram: Oh, it really is, and I&amp;#8217;ll tell you, it is certainly one of the common challenges that people who do WordPress things run into. You go to WordCamps, back when we used to have those things, so we actually just had our WordCamp Birmingham two weeks ago, and it was wonderful to see people in person. But when you get a group of people who work with clients around, you know, a table eating lunch at an event like a WordCamp, inevitably the conversation turns to bad clients and everybody has a story.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:07:40] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, it&amp;#8217;s just one of those things. I&amp;#8217;ve got a whole litany of stories. On the whole I think I was able to manage this scenario fairly well, but there was a lot of things probably that I shouldn&amp;#8217;t have done. So I gave way in many cases because I believed that the things that the client was asking for didn&amp;#8217;t really push the boundaries too far, although they certainly stepped over the expectations that I had.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But your premise really, the reason why you&amp;#8217;ve been getting into this and talking about this is because you want to prepare people and educate people to give them a kind of legal framework. And you describe it in terms of boxing in a client if you like. That&amp;#8217;s probably too harsh a word.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You go about it in much more conciliatory language than that. But the point is, you are educating people to get themselves into a position where they&amp;#8217;ve got some piece of paperwork, some contract. Something written down somewhere where you can all go back and say, okay, these are the boundaries, these are the constraints. If we step outside of these, one of us is at fault. So tell us a little bit more about your approach there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:08:47] Nathan Ingram: That&amp;#8217;s a great question. So years ago I put talk together about dealing with problem clients. And the title of the talk was &amp;#8220;dealing with problem clients, building fences around friendly monsters&amp;#8221;. And it&amp;#8217;s a book, actually now I turned that into a book on Amazon. But, it&amp;#8217;s really positioning the client, every client as what I would call a friendly monster.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meaning they&amp;#8217;re friendly, but they still have teeth. The idea is we need to build fences around the clients that we work with, because we never know what kind of person we&amp;#8217;re dealing with. And the fences that I talk about are the systems and processes in our business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Four in particular. We need to establish clarity. We need to have good commitments between us and our clients. We need to have communication and documentation. And those four fences can show up in a lot of different ways depending on your particular business and how you work. And there may be additional fences you&amp;#8217;d want to build, but those four at least have to be in place in order to have good ongoing client relationships.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And a lot of those things show up in a contract. But they start as just part of your regular business system, the way you work, the way you deal with clients. Clarity, commitments, communication, documentation. And that&amp;#8217;s where it all has to start. Like you&amp;#8217;ve got to get your house in order before you can really bring in a good document, like a contract to, make your rules clear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:10:10] Nathan Wrigley: I think the clarity piece coming first is really intriguing. Because that was always the misstep that I felt I&amp;#8217;d made. In that I was very often in a position where I felt that I had explained myself clearly, and assuming the clients were being honest when they were explaining their frustration with the way things were going.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I clearly hadn&amp;#8217;t done that. I maybe expressed it in a way which I understood, maybe that was too technical. And later down the road it became obvious that there was a complete disconnect between what I was trying to achieve, and what they, in their head, had got designed. And so yeah, the clarity piece, I think is perfect at the beginning, but also quite difficult to achieve. How do you, how do you advise that? What are some of the strategies that you&amp;#8217;ve got in place around that?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:10:57] Nathan Ingram: Yeah, it really is difficult, and one of the first things I think you have to realize is that agreement on the surface does not equal clarity. So, if there&amp;#8217;s no meeting of the minds, like maybe we use technical jargon, or maybe the client doesn&amp;#8217;t tell you everything at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t tell you how many projects I&amp;#8217;ve gotten into where the client, we&amp;#8217;ll get three quarters of the way through the project, and they&amp;#8217;re like, oh, well where do my clients log in? Well, wait, we haven&amp;#8217;t talked about this at all. And in those sorts of situations you ask yourself, well, whose fault is that?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And I would say it&amp;#8217;s probably 50 50. And so one of the great skills that we can develop in in way, but specifically in our way of working with people on the web, is learning the skill of asking great questions. If you learn the skill of asking great questions, and continuing to ask until you reach that point of clarity. That skill can really set you apart from other people that are doing client work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asking a question, asking why, and following up with additional questions until you really get down to the root of what the client expects. If you don&amp;#8217;t do that, then oftentimes you can be saying one thing, the client can be saying another, and you&amp;#8217;re both shaking your head up and down, but nobody is really clear on what we&amp;#8217;re saying. Assumptions are made.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:12:08] Nathan Wrigley: In the work that you do, do you typically do all of that client exploration work prior to beginning the build? And then in a sense, that process is closed off, and you go away and you take six weeks, whatever it takes to complete your initial first offering and then go back to the client? Or do you, do you encourage a more agile approach where you iterate with the client? I mean, I know that they&amp;#8217;re completely different ways of doing things. Curious as to know what your process is.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:12:36] Nathan Ingram: So it really depends on the complexity of the build. We try to get some understanding of that at the very beginning, when we&amp;#8217;re trying to create the scope of work. If it&amp;#8217;s a project we&amp;#8217;ve done before, if it&amp;#8217;s a simple, just a basic identity piece, a brochure site, that&amp;#8217;s fairly simple.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you get into something that is a lot more complicated, maybe there&amp;#8217;s lots of different content types, or you&amp;#8217;ve got to do some really interesting thing with data. A lot of times what we&amp;#8217;ll end up doing, and I picked this up from my friend Beth Livingston, a change budget. So adding a change budget into the original pricing, that as we go forward and the client gets more ideas where things are uncovered, that we didn&amp;#8217;t realize, there&amp;#8217;s some pre-approved money sitting there, that the client can say, okay, we&amp;#8217;ll allocate some of that change budget to build this thing that we hadn&amp;#8217;t talked about yet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:13:22] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, we&amp;#8217;re in such a curious industry as well, in that there&amp;#8217;s not many things that I purchase that morph over time. You know, if I go into a shop and I buy some clothes, I&amp;#8217;m just getting what I&amp;#8217;m getting. I can see it right off the bat, and there it is, and I can hold it in my hands, and it&amp;#8217;s either what I want or it&amp;#8217;s not what I want.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not going to purchase that pair of trousers and then turned around a week later and said, actually, you know what? These pockets. I&amp;#8217;ve been wearing these trousers for a couple of weeks now, and the pockets are not deep enough. Can we have an amendment to the pockets please? This curious idea of scope creep that creeps into more or less every project that I was ever involved in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Are you getting your clients, after your initial discussions then, are you getting them to a point where you draw up some contract which in effect puts the four fences around the friendly monster that you were describing?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:14:12] Nathan Ingram: In our world we would call that the scope of work, which is part of the proposal. That comes from the original conversation. Or if it&amp;#8217;s a complicated project, maybe there&amp;#8217;s a discovery phase that happens first to really flesh out, what is the scope of work? What are we trying to accomplish in this project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then depending on the complexity of the project, the longer, or the more complex a project is, the greater chance of scope creep. Or honestly, the longer a project takes, because the client delays on content or something else. The longer a project takes also, you tend to have scope creep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you talk about scope creep, people&amp;#8217;s eyes roll. They hate scope creep. But I&amp;#8217;ll tell you what, I love scope creep as long as there&amp;#8217;s corresponding price creep, right? If you want more things, that&amp;#8217;s great. It&amp;#8217;s just we can&amp;#8217;t do more for the same price. In your analogy about, we don&amp;#8217;t use the word trousers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:15:00] Nathan Wrigley: Oh yeah, you use pants don&amp;#8217;t you? I apologize.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:15:02] Nathan Ingram: Yeah. When you&amp;#8217;re talking about something like that, it&amp;#8217;s a little bit different because, well some people sell websites more as a product rather than a custom service. We&amp;#8217;re more on the custom build side. Everything we do is bespoke. But you know, if you&amp;#8217;re selling websites as a service, that is a good analogy because you&amp;#8217;re in package three and this is what it comes with and this is your pair of pants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But for us it would be more like, I&amp;#8217;m hiring a contractor to come in and do a remodel on a kitchen .And this is kind of what we talk about at the beginning, but as we go, maybe we had a problem we didn&amp;#8217;t anticipate. Or maybe my wife sees something on television that she wants to add. And so we want to add to it and we change it along the way. That&amp;#8217;s really a closer analogy, I would think, to a custom website.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:15:44] Nathan Wrigley: It&amp;#8217;s pretty clear that the audience for this podcast is pretty broad and deep. In other words, there are all sorts of people listening to this doing all sorts of work around the WordPress space. Some of them very new to WordPress and website building at all. Some of them just doing it for their own hobbies. Other people just getting into building websites for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#8217;s speak to that crowd first. The crowd who really are just embarking on a career. They&amp;#8217;re scoping out whether they wish to build websites for other people and charge for that, and make a business out of that. Let&amp;#8217;s speak to the importance of a contract, because it may be that when you&amp;#8217;re starting out, you&amp;#8217;re just doing this with friends and we know that that can turn south quite quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, and also, you know, you may be encouraging businesses in your local area to come on board and they&amp;#8217;re going to be expecting something like a contract. Is this an essential component of the makeup of a web designer? Do you truly need a contract? Or is there any realistic situation where it&amp;#8217;s okay to begin work on a website, charging a fee without some legal protection?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:16:50] Nathan Ingram: Wow, what a great question. For years I worked without a contract. I just had a proposal with a scope of work and a price, and you pay me, I build the thing and there it goes. Then I started running into problems. Expectations that were never really talked about anywhere. For example, oh wait, this would&amp;#8217;ve been like many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But at that point it was maybe Internet Explorer 6 was the browser of choice for everyone. And the person would say, wait this is not working on my Internet Explorer 4. Well, we don&amp;#8217;t design for older browsers, we design for newer browsers. And there was great difference in rendering between those two.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are the sorts of things that you don&amp;#8217;t think about until you have a problem with a client. What I like to say is you don&amp;#8217;t need a contract for good clients. You need a contract for bad clients. But my goodness, it&amp;#8217;s hard to tell them apart at the beginning. So every client gets a contract. And my contract is mostly plain English, and virtually every paragraph in that contract, aside from the necessary legal constructions, everything in that contract is there because I had a problem one time with a client. That now gets added to the contract for the next time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:17:59] Nathan Wrigley: I was very much like you in that I began way back, and it was long before IE6 in fact. I remember writing that into my contracts at one point. We are not supporting IE6. It was exactly the problem you described. I had happily breezed through multiple websites. No problem at all, everything was fine. I had a client who simply was able to push harder than anybody I&amp;#8217;d come across before. In other words everything that I delivered, they would either reject or request it to be entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So this whole notion to me of scope creep and the client who refused to accept that anything was finished, came along. And it really was at that point that I started to look around and try to protect myself. So, I would imagine that your advice is really, it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter on what level you&amp;#8217;re doing this. You need some kind of legal protection, right?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:18:51] Nathan Ingram: So I would even take a step backwards. You need a consistent process that you use for every client, every project, every time. And that process needs to be documented somewhere in something that you and the client agree to. Call it whatever you want. Call it a contract. Call it, as we do, a master services agreement. You could put it in your proposal, but just have some place where everybody&amp;#8217;s agreeing to the process. That&amp;#8217;s that piece of clarity at the beginning where we are clear on how this is going to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where we get into trouble is where we, we think, well we just sort of do every project differently and there&amp;#8217;s not really a consistent process. And so the client is able at that point to dictate how the project goes. Will have at some point, you know, some level of control over your world, as long as you&amp;#8217;re building that website. Instead of realizing, okay, this is the best way to build. We&amp;#8217;re going to document this process out, and have the client agree to it in a contract.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:19:47] Nathan Wrigley: I guess whenever I&amp;#8217;ve read legal contracts before, whether they&amp;#8217;re for my car insurance or what have you. I&amp;#8217;m always confounded by the language used, within moments of beginning the reading of it. I&amp;#8217;m coming across, not only words which I haven&amp;#8217;t encountered before, but the sentence construction is entirely bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, it can be read by a lawyer. Sometimes I&amp;#8217;m confused as to whether or not it&amp;#8217;s written deliberately to be hard read or whether or not it&amp;#8217;s the most expedient way of hammering something down perfectly. I can never parse that. Either way, I&amp;#8217;m left confounded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So given that lawyers very often end up with this language, which is impenetrable. And you mentioned that your contracts are in plain English. Is it possible to nail things down, absolutely watertight with plain English? And do you feel yourself equipped to do that? Or is this really the domain of a lawyer? Do we need to get a lawyer to go through your contract and inspect it to make sure that in every scenario it&amp;#8217;s having your back?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:20:59] Nathan Ingram: So, just first of all, I&amp;#8217;ll answer this from my perspective as a person who&amp;#8217;s been working with clients, doing web things for over 25 years. I&amp;#8217;m not an attorney. This is not legal advice or anything like that. But my experience has been sort of a blend of both.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important to have good, practical experience working with clients and knowing what the problems are. But you also do need the legal language. Because if the worst thing happens and you end up in court with a client, there&amp;#8217;s a reason that attorneys write things the way they do. You know, this is language that has been proven out and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so if you take a contract that is exclusively plain English, you can get tied up with defining what the meanings of this word and that word and so forth are, and it turns into a mess. So, if you went out today and you did a search for a web design contract on the web, you would find two types of contracts in general.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You would find some that are just absolutely plain English with no legal constructions whatsoever. And those are okay. They do establish clarity, or give you kind of a template to establish some clarity. But they don&amp;#8217;t have the legal protections. On the other side, it&amp;#8217;s like the total opposite end of the spectrum. Contracts that are a hundred percent legalese, and I don&amp;#8217;t understand what some of these things mean. And this is what you were talking about a bit earlier. And I&amp;#8217;m not sure if that really gives clarity to the client, because nobody really knows what any of this means unless you&amp;#8217;re an attorney.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so what I found to be the best approach, and this is what I&amp;#8217;ve done, is I began years ago explaining our process. Explaining what we do, what we don&amp;#8217;t do. Explaining some of the issues like browser compatibility, and what happens if you hire a digital marketing person that comes in and they break your website. Are we responsible for that because we&amp;#8217;re managing your website.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All of the bad experiences I&amp;#8217;ve had with clients, I started putting those things down in a document and then I gave that to an attorney and said, okay, make this legal. And so they added all the necessary legal constructions, and patched the holes. Over time this has become my agency contract, and that&amp;#8217;s what I ultimately turned into MonsterContracts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:23:02] Nathan Wrigley: With your contracts, did you find that the nature of the project at hand, in other words, the one that you&amp;#8217;re working on right now. Given that each client website is slightly different and it may have different constraints. It may need, I don&amp;#8217;t know, let&amp;#8217;s imagine, a WooCommerce store or something like that. We really are getting into a completely different variety of website. Or it may be a simple brochure site. Or it may be that there&amp;#8217;s a bespoke plugin, for example, has to be written for that website.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Do you advise taking those contracts that you&amp;#8217;ve had written, or rather inspected by lawyers, do you take them back and get them to look, more of a scan through each time and append to it, the bits and pieces that are needed? Or have you settled on a contract which you think is broadly good enough to fit any situation?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:23:50] Nathan Ingram: It&amp;#8217;s a great question. So this exact situation is why I recommend a two document approach. So we have a proposal of services that deals with the scope of work and the price for every individual project. And those are going to be different every time. But then we have a master services agreement, or a contract, that has the rules of the road for every project. These don&amp;#8217;t change. And so we present those documents together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So the contract that the master services agreement covers the process. All these things that we do and timeframes, and what happens if you don&amp;#8217;t pay and, here&amp;#8217;s how the website management works, and we don&amp;#8217;t guarantee results for SEO.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All these things that need to be in a contract that don&amp;#8217;t change from project to project, are there in the contract. But then the scope of work of we&amp;#8217;re going to build this plugin, or we&amp;#8217;re going to add a store, we&amp;#8217;re going to do whatever. Those are in the proposal, which is the scope of work and the price for that individual project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:24:43] Nathan Wrigley: Right, okay, that&amp;#8217;s an intriguing separation. Yeah, so two different documents. One which is more bespoke and one which is more generic and you can reuse over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:24:53] Nathan Ingram: Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:24:54] Nathan Wrigley: So, given that we&amp;#8217;ve got a contract. Given that it&amp;#8217;s been written by a lawyer, and there may be aspects in there that are impenetrable to us. I guess there&amp;#8217;s always going to be a need to go back to the lawyers. I can imagine the fees of this starting to tick up quite quickly actually. Because if a client comes back to you and you believe they&amp;#8217;re in breach of the contract in some way, but the contract is difficult to read, it&amp;#8217;s in that legal language. That&amp;#8217;s an important thing to do, isn&amp;#8217;t it? You really do have to understand the ins and outs of your contract.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So given any scenario of inverted commas, wrongdoing by the client, you are able to say to them with confidence, look, this is what you signed. This is what this clause in the contract meant. In other words, you have to know what it says in plain English in your head. Otherwise you can&amp;#8217;t really enforce it, because you wouldn&amp;#8217;t be sure what you were able to enforce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:25:47] Nathan Ingram: Right, and this is why if you were to open my agency contract, or if you were to look at MonsterContracts. You would see things like payment terms, and they&amp;#8217;re all in plain English. Again, this is why I said earlier, I want to have my system documented ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like I want to know, internally, this is how we deal with late payments. This is what happens if the client disappears during a project, all these things. We have our policies internally for this. Those are then put into the contract in very plain wording that can be easily pointed to. There have to be legal constructions, but these are, they&amp;#8217;re really at the end of the document and they don&amp;#8217;t pertain, nearly as much to these practical issues that come up with the client.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:26:28] Nathan Wrigley: Do you ever, so this is a question more directed at you personally, given that you&amp;#8217;ve got all these contracts and you&amp;#8217;ve thought all of this through. Do you ever let things slip, in other words, you&amp;#8217;re having a conflict internally. Part of you saying, I know that this client is now in breach of what the, not only the spirit, but the letter of the contract said. But I&amp;#8217;ve got a bit of a spidey sense that I can let this one go. It feels like it&amp;#8217;s going to be all right. Because there be monsters down there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s so easy. I did that and probably continue to do that quite a bit, because sometimes I feel that if I push the legal button, I really have transformed everything. I&amp;#8217;ve suddenly gone from it being a fairly friendly relationship, albeit fraught at times. To a really adversarial relationship where the lawyers are getting involved and so on. So I&amp;#8217;m just wondering whether or you permit yourself to ignore your contracts in some scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:27:24] Nathan Ingram: Oh, what a great question. So the answer to that question, it revolves around emotional intelligence, right? you have to make a judgment call on, is this a situation that is worth really enforcing the contract or not. And honestly, many times, let&amp;#8217;s just say, here&amp;#8217;s the situation. The client, we&amp;#8217;ve been waiting for three months for the client to supply assets that are needed to build the website, and that happens all the time, right? Clients delay, delay, delay for content, and photography and everything.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, in the contract, it says if we haven&amp;#8217;t heard from you in 30 days, then your project is suspended. And there&amp;#8217;s some things that happen as a result of that. Now, can we choose to change that? Sure, but oftentimes what will solve that problem is a simple email to the client. Hey, we haven&amp;#8217;t heard from you in the last 30 days. At this point your project is about to go into suspended status. And this is what that means.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We explain in the contract. And just having a clarifying email like that can oftentimes shake up the client and get them refocused on the project. If it doesn&amp;#8217;t, then you have to make a judgment call on, is this a salvageable project or not?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:28:34] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I feel like I&amp;#8217;ve encountered many different interpretations of this. On the one hand, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of people out there in the wild who really are proponents of, look, the minute it goes wrong, start lawyering. Just protect yourself. Get the lawyers involved. You cease communication with the client and start to go through the lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s this idea of, it&amp;#8217;s not working out. I need you to do what you&amp;#8217;ve agreed right now, otherwise it doesn&amp;#8217;t work. We also hear constantly about firing clients and the joy that that can bring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, I feel that, like you said, you have to judge off your own instincts sometimes whether there is a legitimate reason behind there. And that has happened to me. You know, I&amp;#8217;ve had clients that have not delivered things, and then it turns out there&amp;#8217;s not only a plausible reason, but a reason, which if it were me in their shoes, I would desperately want the web designer to understand my crisis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Something personal has happened, some event in their life has meant that they literally have been away from the computer for weeks on end. And so it&amp;#8217;s not really their fault. I guess the answer is use your judgment. Invoke the spidey sense, and figure out which is the best way to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:29:42] Nathan Ingram: For sure. I mean, we&amp;#8217;re dealing with people here, right? And so my default dealing with people is generally grace. I&amp;#8217;m very gracious with people. Understanding about issues that come up. On the other hand, it&amp;#8217;s important to have a document that protects you. If you get to the point where you have to fire the client.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s a great conversation. And, and you hear a lot, especially on social media and Facebook groups and places like that. Oh, we got to fire the client. This whole discussion, right? But that&amp;#8217;s complicated. If you want to fire the client, can you even do that? Do you have a contract that specifies what happens if you want to terminate the relationship?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s where having a good document that protects you is critical, because you know at some point, oh, the client didn&amp;#8217;t pay me, so I&amp;#8217;m going to turn their website off. Well, guess what? If you just turn their website off for non payment, and they haven&amp;#8217;t agreed to that stipulation, then you can get sued for that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well you didn&amp;#8217;t give me due process and whatever. And you can find yourself in a lot of trouble if you don&amp;#8217;t have a good document that protects you. So my advice is always have a great contract that is weighted towards you as the service provider, and then you can choose to be gracious when you want.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:30:44] Nathan Wrigley: So let&amp;#8217;s get into that bit. You were mentioning about switching the website off. So it&amp;#8217;s almost like the sanctions piece. What do you have in your arsenal as a web designer, which you can bring to bear should you need to apply a little bit of pressure to make sure that things are moving? So I&amp;#8217;m describing a scenario now where things have clearly gone south.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re definitely in the territory of miscommunication has been heaped upon miscommunication. We&amp;#8217;re at the point of almost falling out. Communication is breaking down, and so we now need to bring out the big guns, if you like. What have we got? You mentioned turning off the website, that&amp;#8217;s obviously one thing that we could do, given that that was in a contract.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m thinking we could refuse to do any additional work. There&amp;#8217;s obviously the refusal to communicate unless you go through lawyers at this point. What are the kind of things that you would put in your contracts that you would allow yourself to have as an option?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:31:40] Nathan Ingram: So it would obviously depend on where we are in the process of the project. But if you&amp;#8217;re in the middle of building the site, the client is texting you at 2:00 AM, or whatever. This is clearly not going to work, and we&amp;#8217;ve tried to communicate and tried to request the client to change their behaviour, and they just simply won&amp;#8217;t do it for whatever reason, and you need to pull the plug on the project. Then, you know at that point, at least my contract says, we as an agency get to evaluate the work that&amp;#8217;s been done and say, okay, 78% has been completed and so you owe this much more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Or if we&amp;#8217;ve already received full payment, we&amp;#8217;ll refund that much or whatever. You need some process by which you can mitigate or decide who gets what at the end of this. So if you&amp;#8217;re in the middle of the project, and you want to pull the plug, somebody has to figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#8217;s a client that&amp;#8217;s maybe in a management phase and they&amp;#8217;re just not paying their bill or they&amp;#8217;re asking for too much or whatever, it&amp;#8217;s always a conversation. What&amp;#8217;s going on here? And is there something we don&amp;#8217;t understand about this? But, at some point you have to have an agreement that if you don&amp;#8217;t pay your bill within certain time, then we do suspend the website from view.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:32:46] Nathan Wrigley: I guess there is also a point where you have to cease communication through anything other than the lawyers. Because at some point any stream of email going left, right, and center has to be mediated by a professional who&amp;#8217;s removed from all of this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:33:03] Nathan Ingram: Yeah, you really do. And you know, we first tried to do arbitration, just to try to keep things out of court. That&amp;#8217;s just a personal preference. But at some point you have to do that. Now, thankfully I&amp;#8217;ve never even gotten close to anything like that, and I&amp;#8217;ve heard horror stories of where it&amp;#8217;s gotten to that point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You know, a lot of this is, as you work with clients and you have good client experiences and bad client experiences. You start to develop, like you said earlier, this spidey sense. This radar of early on, like before you even sign a proposal with a client, getting better at filtering out the bad clients at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hopefully over time that becomes part of this, where you don&amp;#8217;t have nearly the issues. Early on I had bad clients. They would take advantage of me. they didn&amp;#8217;t want to pay. They wanted to pay a just a little bit, not really what the work was worth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They would constantly second guess and question my professional decisions. It was just terrible. I began to realize there are better clients out there and, not let those difficult clients in our world to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:34:02] Nathan Wrigley: It&amp;#8217;s interesting as this podcast has gone on, we&amp;#8217;ve concentrated on the negative aspect of contracts, in the, you know, we&amp;#8217;re protecting ourselves. This horrible thing could happen, so make sure you&amp;#8217;ve got some protection. Oh, and this horrible thing could happen. But really, it&amp;#8217;s the opposite, isn&amp;#8217;t it? The contract is there to give you peace of mind. It&amp;#8217;s to create a sort of positive scenario.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And so hopefully you won&amp;#8217;t find yourself in these positions. If the contract is robust enough, everybody signed it, read it, understood it, then those boundaries are in place so that these disasters don&amp;#8217;t occur. So there&amp;#8217;s a bit of silver lining on this cloud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:34:38] Nathan Ingram: Oh, it absolutely is. There&amp;#8217;s this old story about this mother who&amp;#8217;d warned her children about playing next to the road because they lived next to this busy highway. And oh, don&amp;#8217;t get close to the road because, you know, you could get hit by a car or whatever. And so the kids would not go just a few feet from the house because they were terrified of this road.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then they realized, well, our kids aren&amp;#8217;t even playing in our yard. So they put up a fence between the yard and the road. And the kids then could play within the boundaries of the fence and weren&amp;#8217;t afraid of the road anymore. And that&amp;#8217;s just a little example of put up a fence, a contract, and it really frees you to work better with clients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And in my experience, it&amp;#8217;s if a client out of the gate, if the client pushes back against some of the things in our contract, it&amp;#8217;s a huge red flag that we probably don&amp;#8217;t want to work with this client, just right away. Because everything that is in our contract is there for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I tell the clients that. It&amp;#8217;s a rather long document, but everything is there for a purpose. And if you have questions about it, I&amp;#8217;m happy to answer those, you know, happy to talk through why we do this. But it&amp;#8217;s there for a reason and it really establishes the boundaries of our relationship.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And the remarkable thing about all of this is, people look at a contract, well, I&amp;#8217;m afraid to get my clients to sign this, it&amp;#8217;s really long or whatever. The good clients have no problem signing contracts like this. They welcome it. It&amp;#8217;s a mark of your professionalism that you&amp;#8217;ve thought through your business well enough to have a well crafted document that governs this whole process of us working together.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:36:03] Nathan Wrigley: You&amp;#8217;ve obviously given this a great deal of thought in the past. You live in the United States and you mentioned Alabama. Obviously America&amp;#8217;s a tapestry of different states with laws and, honestly I don&amp;#8217;t understand that a little bit. But in the UK we have UK law and then there&amp;#8217;s EU law, and then obviously there&amp;#8217;s law in other jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This, I suppose is something which we might mention right now, towards the end of our recording. You&amp;#8217;ve got to have that in mind as well. It really does matter where you are and where the clients are because I guess you&amp;#8217;ve got to think about the law. Should it go wrong, are you protected correctly given where the client is and where you are?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:36:40] Nathan Ingram: Yeah, for sure. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of local laws that govern things that you wouldn&amp;#8217;t think about. And that&amp;#8217;s why it&amp;#8217;s critical to have a local attorney that understands technology and things like intellectual property and these sorts of things, to take a look at whatever document you have.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges with MonsterContracts was, okay, I&amp;#8217;ve got this document that I have a hundred percent faith in for my work here, and really even state to state. There are very few things that would have to change from state to state, using in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But then we started getting some people buying the product internationally. And I began to wonder, wow, how is this going to work? I did have some experience. I had a coaching client, somebody that I was working with in business development who lived there in the UK. I provided her a copy of the contract and she had it vetted through a local attorney there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were just very few changes. So, the way that at least my contract works is most of it, and I would just, pulling a number out of the air, say 80% of the document is just plain language about processes and things like that. And the legal language is at the end. So the attorney in the area, whether it&amp;#8217;s internationally or locally in a different state or whatever, they could just substitute the little bits of standard legal language at the end and make it work wherever you are. And we now have people who&amp;#8217;ve bought MonsterContracts all over the world and they&amp;#8217;re having that experience where the attorney can review it with maybe one or two hours of time. It works great for their location.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:38:05] Nathan Wrigley: So just give us the quick elevator pitch of MonsterContracts. It sounds like that it&amp;#8217;s a service that you can essentially log in, pay your subs, and then you can extract from it contracts, which hopefully you can then use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:38:19] Nathan Ingram: That&amp;#8217;s basically it. And so again, this is, it&amp;#8217;s based on my contract that over 25 years of working with clients, I&amp;#8217;ve gradually made better until it&amp;#8217;s virtually bulletproof, I think, in my opinion. The MonsterContracts is simply a Word document. You log in, you purchase the document. You take this. You tweak anything that&amp;#8217;s there to match your processes or the, you know, if you don&amp;#8217;t do things in the same order that the contract specifies, change that around. Plain simple wording. And then the recommendation is always take that to your local attorney to allow them to, you know, run through it and make any changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And universally the response has been, one or two hours of time and it&amp;#8217;s done. So, for most people they&amp;#8217;re going to have one of the two types. So if they&amp;#8217;re using a contract, they have the type that&amp;#8217;s just plain English and full of holes, or it&amp;#8217;s just a bunch of legalese that no one understands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;MonsterContracts it addresses the specific situations that we encounter as web professionals, and it provides the cover that you need to grow your business. It addresses all the things that we deal with in client work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:39:16] Nathan Wrigley: I think you&amp;#8217;ve got a system whereby you can submit amendments that you&amp;#8217;ve had made. So let&amp;#8217;s say for example, in my case, the UK. I could make amendments and then submit them back to MonsterContracts so that other people can benefit from that as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:39:32] Nathan Ingram: Yeah, exactly. So we have the ability to do that. That&amp;#8217;s an area of MonsterContracts that I&amp;#8217;m really working on growing this year. We haven&amp;#8217;t had as many members do that as I had hoped originally. And so that&amp;#8217;s one of our goals this year is to expand those revisions. MonsterContracts is a subscription, just to keep access because we do have the contract vetted by an attorney annually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And, there are usually at least a few changes to the contract every year to just keep up to date with things that are happening in client work. The subscription gives you access to those changes as well as any revisions that people upload. And if you upload a revision that&amp;#8217;s accepted we credit you for that year&amp;#8217;s cost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:40:06] Nathan Wrigley: So a scary subject hopefully somewhat tamed by having contracts. Nathan, thanks for chatting to us today and putting our minds at rest and giving us some advice. If the listeners to this would like to get in touch or figure out where you are or begin a chat with you, what are the best, some of the best places to find you online?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:40:26] Nathan Ingram: Yeah, sure. So, monstercontracts.com is, the place to find the MonsterContracts product. There&amp;#8217;s a great contact form there if you want to reach out to me about any contract related questions. My coaching website is nathaningram.com. That is available out there for coaching work or questions around that subject. And I&amp;#8217;m online three days a week with iThemes training, at training.ithemes.com.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:40:48] Nathan Wrigley: Nathan Ingram, thank you so much for chatting to us on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;[00:40:52] Nathan Ingram: Thanks, Nathan. I enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the podcast today, we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://nathaningram.com/&quot;&gt;Nathan Ingram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nathan is the host at iThemes Training where he teaches WordPress and business development topics via live webinar. Based in Birmingham, Alabama, he has been working with clients to build websites since 1995.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heâs also the creator of MonsterContracts, which helps WordPress professionals create contracts for their client work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If youâve worked directly with clients, then youâll know that things donât always go according to plan. Assets might not be delivered on time. The client does not respond to your emails. The expectations of the client begins to creep away from the original proposal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whilst thereâs unlikely to be a perfect system to ensure that all projects run according to the plan, you can protect yourself from some of the worst aspects, and for this, you may need a contract.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nathan is on the podcast today to talk about why he thinks contracts are an essential part of any client facing WordPress work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We begin by talking about how the contract is designed as a tool to bring clarity to both parties. You, the website builder, can set out the constraints within which you work, and the client can understand what they can, and cannot, expect from you. Nathan thinks that setting these expectations before the project begins leads to fewer problems later on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We talk about the fact that contracts donât need to contain overly complex legal language, but they do need to be checked by a qualified legal professional before theyâre deployed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nathan also explains how heâs refined his contracts over the years, tweaking the wording and the structure, depending upon the project at hand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We then get into what you can realistically do should your client breach the contract. Are you able to turn off their website or withhold work that youâve completed? Nathanâs not really in favour of sending in the lawyers as soon as something goes wrong, rather trying to resolve any conflict through better communication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Itâs an interesting conversation which makes contracts seem less adversarial and more about ensuring that your WordPress website projects run as smoothly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://wptavern.com/limit-login-attempts-plugin-patches-severe-unauthenticated-stored-xss-vulnerability</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Wordfence has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2023/04/update-now-severe-vulnerability-impacting-600000-sites-patched-in-limit-login-attempts/&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a security advisory about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-1912&quot;&gt;a severe unauthenticated stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts&quot;&gt;Limit Login Attempts&lt;/a&gt; plugin, which is active on more than 600,000 WordPress sites. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The security issue was discovered by Wordfence security researcher Marco Wotschka in January 2023. It was submitted to the WordPress Plugin Security Team, which acknowledged receipt of the report nearly two months later on March 24, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This can be leveraged by unauthenticated attackers to facilitate a site takeover by injecting malicious JavaScript into the database of an affected site that may execute when a site administrator accesses the logging page,&amp;#8221; Wotschka said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts/&quot;&gt;Version 1.7.2&lt;/a&gt; of the plugin patches the vulnerability. It was released on April 4 with a note in the changelog that simply says &amp;#8220;Security fixes.&amp;#8221; Version 1.7.1 and previous versions remain vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In August 2021, the plugin had more than 900,000 active users, and more than 2 million in 2018, but seems to be dying a slow death and is no longer maintained, as it hasn&amp;#8217;t been updated in years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wordfence has more details in the advisory on how the plugin might be exploited and advises users update immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
