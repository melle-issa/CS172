<p>Blockchain. Cryptocurrency. Ethereum. NFTs. DAOs. Smart Contracts. web3. It&#8217;s impossible to avoid the blockchain hype machine these days, but it&#8217;s often just as difficult to decipher what it all means.</p>



<p>On top of that, discourse around web3 is extremely polarising: everyone involved is very keen to a) pick a team, and b) get you to join their team. If you haven&#8217;t picked a team, you must be secretly with the other team.</p>



<p>Max Read made a compelling argument that the web3 debate is in fact two different debates:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>But, OK, what is the root disagreement, exactly? The way I read it there are two broad &#8220;is web3 bullshit?&#8221; debates, not just one, centered around the following questions:</p><p>Can the blockchain do anything that other currently existing technology <em>cannot</em> do and/or do anything <em>better or more efficiently </em>than other currently existing technology?</p><p>Will the blockchain form the architecture of the internet of the future (i.e. &#8220;web3&#8221;), and/or will blockchain-native companies and organizations become important and powerful?</p><cite><a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/is-web3-bullshit">Max Read — Is web3 bullshit?</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>I&#8217;m inclined to agree with Max&#8217;s analysis here: there&#8217;s a technical question, and there&#8217;s a business/cultural question. It&#8217;s hard to separate the two when every day sees new headlines about <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/126367/crypto-exchange-bitmart-reportedly-hacked-for-100-million">millions of dollars being stolen or scammed</a>; or thousands of people putting millions of dollars into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConstitutionDAO">highly optimistic ventures</a>. There are extreme positives and extreme negatives happening all the time in the web3 world.</p>



<p>With that in mind, I want to take a step back from the day-to-day excitement of cryptocurrency and web3, and look at some of the driving philosophies espoused by the movement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="philosophies-of-web3">Philosophies of web3</h2>



<p>There are a lot of differing viewpoints on web3, every individual has a slightly different take on it. There are three broad themes that stand out, however. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="decentralised">Decentralised</h3>



<p>Blockchain-based technology is inherently distributed (with some esoteric caveats, but we can safely ignore them for now). In a world where the web centres around a handful of major services, where we&#8217;ve seen the harm that the likes of Facebook and YouTube can inflict on society, it&#8217;s not surprising that decentralisation would be a powerful theme drawing in anyone looking for an alternative.</p>



<p>Decentralisation isn&#8217;t new to the Internet, of course: it&#8217;s right there in the name. This giant set of &#8220;<strong>inter</strong>connected <strong>net</strong>works&#8221; has been decentralised from the very beginning. It&#8217;s not perfect, of course: oppressive governments can take control of the borders of their portion of the Internet, and we&#8217;ve come to rely on a handful of web services to handle the trickier parts of using the web. But fundamentally, that decentralised architecture is still there. I can still set up a web site hosted on my home computer, which anyone in the world could access.</p>



<p>I <em>don&#8217;t</em> do that, however, for the same reason that web3 isn&#8217;t immune from centralised services: Centralisation is convenient. Just as we have Facebook, or Google, or Amazon as giant centralised services on the current web, we can already see similar services appearing for web3. For payments, Coinbase has established itself as a hugely popular place exchange cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies. For NFTs, OpenSea is the service where you&#8217;ll find nearly every NFT collection. MetaMask keeps all of your crypto-based keys, tokens, and logins in a single &#8220;crypto wallet&#8221;.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Centralisation is convenient.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>While web3 proponents give a lot of credence to the decentralised nature of cryptocurrency being a driver of popularity, I&#8217;m not so sure. At best, I&#8217;m inclined to think that decentralisation is table stakes these days: you can&#8217;t even get started as a global movement without a strong commitment to decentralisation.</p>



<p>But if decentralisation isn&#8217;t the key, what is?</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ownership">Ownership</h3>



<p>When we talk about ownership in web3, NFTs are clearly the flavour of the month, but recent research indicates that the entire NFT market is massively artificially inflated.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Analysis of 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs shows that the top 10% of traders have traded 97% of NFTs which definitely puts meat on the bones of the hypothesis that a lot of NFT trades are wash sales intended to artificially boost prices. <a href="https://t.co/ufgmhE2iBi">https://t.co/ufgmhE2iBi</a></p>&mdash; Dare Obasanjo (@Carnage4Life) <a href="https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life/status/1465811132954800131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Rather than taking pot-shots at the NFT straw man, I think it&#8217;s more interesting to look at the idea of ownership in terms of <em>attribution</em>. The more powerful element of this philosophy isn&#8217;t about who owns something, it&#8217;s who created it. NFTs do something rather novel with attribution, allowing royalty payments to the original artist every time an NFT is resold. I love this aspect: royalties shouldn&#8217;t just be for movie stars, they should be for everyone.</p>



<p>Comparing that to the current web, take the 3 paragraphs written by Max Read that I quoted above. I was certainly under no <em>technical</em> obligation to show that it was a quote, to attribute it to him, or to link to the source. In fact, it would have been easier for me to just paste his words into this post, and pretend they were my own. I didn&#8217;t, of course, because I feel an <em>ethical</em> obligation to properly attribute the quote.</p>



<p>In a world where unethical actors will automatically copy/paste your content for SEO juice (indeed, I expect this blog post to show up on a bunch of these kinds of sites); where massive corporations will consume everything they can find about you, in order to advertise more effectively to you, it&#8217;s not at all surprising that people are looking for a technical solution for taking back control of their data, and for being properly attributed for their creations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The interesting element of this philosophy isn&#8217;t about who owns something, it&#8217;s who created it.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>That&#8217;s not to say that existing services discourage attribution: a core function of Twitter is retweets, a core function of Tumblr is reblogging. WordPress still supports trackbacks, even if many folks turn them off these days.</p>



<p>These are all blunt instruments, though, aimed at attributing an entire piece, rather than a more targeted approach. What I&#8217;d really like is a way to easily quote and attribute a small chunk of a post: 3 paragraphs (or blocks, if you want to see where I&#8217;m heading <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />), inserted into my post, linking back to where I got them from. If someone chooses to quote some of this post, I&#8217;d love to receive a pingback just for that quote, so it can be seen in the right context.</p>



<p>The functionality provide by Twitter and Tumblr is less of a technologically-based enforcement of attribution, and more of an example of paving the cow path: by and large, people want to properly attribute others, providing the tools to do so can easily become a fundamental part of how any software is used.</p>



<p>These tools only work so long as there&#8217;s an incentive to use them, however. web3 certainly provides the tools to attribute others, but much like SEO scammers copy/pasting blog posts, the economics of the NFT bubble is clearly a huge incentive to ignore those tools and ethical obligations, to the point that existing services have had to build additional features just to detect this abuse.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-mel-magazine wp-block-embed-mel-magazine"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="I2XJqG2LZy"><a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/art-theft-nfts">Digital Bandits: The New Art Thieves Selling Stolen Works As NFTs</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Digital Bandits: The New Art Thieves Selling Stolen Works As NFTs&#8221; &#8212; MEL Magazine" src="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/art-theft-nfts/embed#?secret=I2XJqG2LZy" data-secret="I2XJqG2LZy" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="monetisation">Monetisation</h3>



<p>With every major blockchain also being a cryptocurrency, monetisation is at the heart of the entire web3 movement. Every level of <a href="https://web3.foundation/about/">the web3 tech stack</a> involves a cryptocurrency-based protocol. This naturally permeates through the entire web3 ecosystem, where money becomes a major driving factor for every web3-based project.</p>



<p>And so, it&#8217;s impossible to look at web3 applications without also considering the financial aspect. When you have to pay just to participate, you have to ask whether every piece of content you create is &#8220;worth it&#8221;.</p>



<p>Again, let&#8217;s go back to the 3 paragraphs I quote above. In a theoretical web3 world, I&#8217;d publish this post on a blockchain in some form or another, and that act would also likely include noting that I&#8217;d quoted 3 blocks of text attributed to Max Read. I&#8217;d potentially pay some amount of money to Max, along with the fees that every blockchain charges in order to perform a transaction. While this process is potentially helpful to the original author at a first glance, I suspect the second and third order effects will be problematic. Having only just clicked the Publish button a few seconds earlier, I&#8217;m already some indeterminate amount of money out of pocket. Which brings me back to the question, is this post &#8220;worth it&#8221;? Will enough people tip/quote/remix/whatever me, to cover the cost of publishing? When every creative work <em>must</em> be viewed through a lens of financial impact, it fundamentally alters that creative process.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>When you have to pay just to participate, you have to ask whether every piece of content you create is &#8220;worth it&#8221;.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Ultimately, we live in a capitalist society, and everyone deserves the opportunity to profit off their work. But by baking monetisation into the underlying infrastructure of web3, it becomes impossible to opt-out. You either have the money to participate without being concerned about the cost, <em>or</em> you&#8217;re going to need to weigh up every interaction by whether or not you can afford it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="web3-philosophies-in-wordpress">Web3 Philosophies in WordPress</h2>



<p>After breaking it all down, we can see that it&#8217;s not all black-and-white. There are some positive parts of web3, and some negative parts. Not that different to the web of today, in fact. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> That&#8217;s not to say that either approach is the correct one: instead, we should be looking to learn from both, and produce something better.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="decentralised-1">Decentralised</h3>



<p>I&#8217;ve long been a proponent of leveraging the massive install base of WordPress to provide distributed services to anyone. Years ago, I spoke about an idea called &#8220;<a href="https://wordpress.tv/2016/07/02/gary-pendergast-connected-wordpress/">Connected WordPress</a>&#8221; that would do exactly that. While the idea didn&#8217;t gain a huge amount of traction at the time, the DNA of the Connected WordPress concept shares a lot of similar traits to the decentralised nature of web3.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of decentralised technologies as a way for individuals to claw back power over their own data from the governments and massive corporations that would prefer to keep it all centralised, and I absolutely think we should be exploring ways to make the existing web more resistant to censorship.</p>



<p>At the same time, we have to acknowledge that there are certainly benefits to centralisation. As long as people have the freedom to choose how and where they participate, and centralised services are required to play nicely with self hosted sites, is there a practical difference?</p>



<p>I quite like how <a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid</a> allows you have it both ways, whilst maintaining control over your own data.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ownership-attribution"><s>Ownership</s> Attribution</h3>



<p>Here&#8217;s the thing about attribution: you can&#8217;t enforce it with technology alone. Snapchat have indirectly demonstrated exactly this problem: in order to not lose a message, people would screenshot or record the message on their phone. In response, Snapchat implemented a feature to notify the other party when you screenshot a message from them. To avoid this, people will now use a second phone to take a photo or video of the message. While this example isn&#8217;t specifically about attribution, it demonstrates the problem that there&#8217;s no way to technologically restrict how someone interacts with content that you&#8217;ve published, once they&#8217;ve been granted access.</p>



<p>Instead of worrying about technical restrictions, then, we should be looking at how attribution can be made easier.</p>



<p><a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a> is a great example of how this can be done in a totally decentralised fashion.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="monetisation-1">Monetisation</h3>



<p>I&#8217;m firmly of the opinion that monetisation of the things you create should be opt-in, rather than opt-out.</p>



<p>Modern society is currently obsessed with monetising everything, however. It comes in many different forms: hustle culture, side gigs, transforming hobbies into businesses, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme_stocks">meme stocks</a>, and cryptocurrencies: they&#8217;re all symptoms of this obsession.</p>



<p>I would argue that, rather than accepting as <em>fait accompli</em> that the next iteration of the web will be monetised to the core, we should be pushing back against this approach. Fundamentally, we should be looking to build for a post scarcity society, rather than trying to introduce scarcity where there previously was none.</p>



<p>While we work towards that future, we should certainly be easier for folks to monetise their work, but the current raft of cryptocurrencies just aren&#8217;t up to the task of operating as&#8230; currencies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-should-you-do">What Should You Do?</h2>



<p>Well, that depends on what your priorities are. The conversations around web3 are taking up a lot of air right now, so it&#8217;s possible to get the impression web3 will be imminently replacing everything. It&#8217;s important to keep perspective on this, though. While there&#8217;s a lot of money in the web3 ecosystem right now, it&#8217;s dwarfed by the sheer size of the existing web.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re excited about the hot new tech, and feeling inspired by the ideas espoused in web3 circles? Jump right in! I&#8217;m certain you&#8217;ll find something interesting to work on.</p>



<p>Always wanted to get into currency speculation, but didn&#8217;t want to deal with all those pesky &#8220;regulations&#8221; and &#8220;safeguards&#8221;? Boy howdy, are cryptocurrencies or NFTs the place for you. (Please don&#8217;t pretend that this paragraph is investment advice, it is nothing of the sort.)</p>



<p>Want to continue building stuff on the web, and you&#8217;re willing to learn new things when you need them, but are otherwise happy with your trajectory? Just keep on doing what you&#8217;re doing. Even if web3 does manage to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3887767/understanding-gartner-s-hype-cycles">live up to the hype</a>, it&#8217;ll take a long time for it to be adopted by the mainstream. You&#8217;ll have years to adapt.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>There are some big promises associated with web3, many of which sound very similar to the promises that were made around web 2.0, particularly around open APIs, and global interoperability. We saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">what happened when those kinds of tools go wrong</a>, and web3 doesn&#8217;t really solve those problems. It may exacerbate them in some ways, since it&#8217;s impossible to delete your data from a blockchain.</p>



<p>That said, (and I say this as a WordPress Core developer), just because a particular piece of software is not the optimal technical solution doesn&#8217;t mean it won&#8217;t become the most popular. Market forces can be a far stronger factor that technical superiority. There are many legitimate complaints about blockchain (including performance, bloat, fit for purpose, and security) that have been levelled against WordPress in the past, but WordPress certainly isn&#8217;t slowing down. I&#8217;m not even close to convinced that blockchain is the right technology to base the web on, but I&#8217;ve been doing this for too long to bet everything against it. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Markets can remain irrational a lot longer than you and I can remain solvent.</p><cite>—A. Gary Shilling</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>As for me, well&#8230; <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>I remain sceptical of web3 as it&#8217;s currently defined, but I think there&#8217;s room to change it, and to adopt the best bits into the existing web. Web 1.0 didn&#8217;t magically disappear when Web 2.0 rolled in, it adapted. Maybe we&#8217;ll look back in 10 years and say this was a time when the web fundamentally changed. Or, maybe we&#8217;ll refer to blockchain in the same breath as pets.com, and other examples from the dotcom boom of the 1990&#8217;s.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.</p><cite>—John Gilmore</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>This quote was originally referring to Usenet, but it&#8217;s stayed highly relevant in the decades since. I think it applies here, too: if the artificial scarcity built into web3 behaves too much like censorship, preventing people from sharing what they want to share, the internet (or, more accurately, the billions of people who interact with the internet) will just&#8230; go around it. It won&#8217;t all be smooth sailing, but we&#8217;ll continue to experiment, evolve, and adapt as it changes.</p>



<p>Personally, I think now is a great time for us to be embracing the values and ideals of projects like <a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid</a>, and <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>. Before web3 referred to blockchains, it was more commonly used in reference to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">Semantic Web</a>, which is far more in line with WordPress&#8217; ideals, whilst also matching many of the values prioritised by the new web3. As a major driver of the Open Web, WordPress can help people own their content in a sustainable way, engage with others on their own terms, and build communities that don&#8217;t depend on massive corporations or hand-wavy magical tech solutions.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t get too caught up in the drama of whatever is the flavour of the month. I&#8217;m optimistic about the long term resilience of the internet, and I think you should be, too. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f973.png" alt="🥳" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Back at<a href="https://pento.net/2021/01/18/wordpress-importers-stating-the-problem/"> the start of this series</a>, I listed four problems within the scope of the WordPress Importers that we needed to address. Three of them are largely technical problems, which I covered in previous posts. In wrapping up this series, I want to focus exclusively on the fourth problem, which has a philosophical side as well as a technical one — but that does not mean we cannot tackle it!</p>



<div class="wp-block-group alignwide is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-center">Problem Number 4</p>



<p class="alignwide has-extra-large-font-size"><strong>Some services work against their customers, and actively prevent site owners from controlling their own content.</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>Some services are merely inconvenient: they provide exports, but it often involves downloading a bunch of different files. Your CMS content is in one export, your store products are in another, your orders are in another, and your mailing list is in yet another. It&#8217;s not ideal, but they at least let you get a copy of your data.</p>



<p>However, there&#8217;s another class of services that actively work against their customers. It&#8217;s these services I want to focus on: the services that don&#8217;t provide any ability to export your content — effectively locking people in to using their platform. We could offer these folks an escape! The aim isn’t to necessarily make them use WordPress, it’s to give them a way out, if they want it. Whether they choose to use WordPress or not after that is immaterial (though I certainly hope they would, of course). The important part is freedom of choice.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth acknowledging that this is a different approach to how WordPress has historically operated in relation to other CMSes. We provide <em>importers</em> for many CMSes, but we previously haven&#8217;t written <em>exporters</em>. However, I don&#8217;t think this is a particularly large step: for CMSes that already provide exports, we&#8217;d continue to use those export files. This is focussed on the few services that try to lock their customers in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Should WordPress Take This On?</h2>



<p>There are several aspects to <em>why</em> we should focus on this.</p>



<p>First of all, it&#8217;s the <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/">the WordPress mission</a>. Underpinning every part of WordPress is the simplest of statements: </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Democratise Publishing</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The freedom to build. The freedom to change. The freedom to share.</em></p>



<p>These freedoms are the pillars of a Free and Open Web, but they’re not invulnerable: at times, they need to be defended, and that needs people with the time and resources to offer a defence.</p>



<p>Which brings me to my second point: WordPress has the people who can offer that defence! The WordPress project has so many individuals working on it, from such a wide variety of backgrounds, we&#8217;re able to take on a vast array of projects that a smaller CMS just wouldn&#8217;t have the bandwidth for. That&#8217;s not to say that we can do <em>everything</em>, but when there&#8217;s a need to defend the entire ecosystem, we&#8217;re able to devote people to the cause.</p>



<p>Finally, it’s important to remember that WordPress doesn’t exist in a vacuum, we’re part of a broad ecosystem which can only exist through the web remaining open and free. By encouraging all CMSes to provide proper exports, and implementing them for those that don’t, we help keep our ecosystem healthy.</p>



<p>We have the ability to take on these challenges, but we have a responsibility that goes alongside. We can&#8217;t do it solely to benefit WordPress, we need to make that benefit available to the entire ecosystem. This is why it&#8217;s important to<a href="https://pento.net/2021/01/20/wordpress-importers-defining-a-schema/"> define a WordPress export schema</a>, so that any CMS can make use of the export we produce, not just WordPress. If you’ll excuse the imagery for a moment, we can be the knight in shining armour that frees people — then gives them the choice of what they do with that freedom, without obligation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Can We Do It?</h2>



<p>Moving on to the technical side of this problem, I can give you some good news: the answer is definitely <em>not</em> screen scraping. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Scraping a site is fragile, impossible to transform into the full content, and provides an incomplete export of the site: anything that&#8217;s only available in the site dashboard can&#8217;t be obtained through scraping.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve recently been experimenting with an alternative approach to solving this problem. Rather than trying to create something resembling a traditional exporter, it turns out that modern CMSes provide the tools we need, in the form of REST APIs. All we need to do is call the appropriate APIs, and collate the results. The fun part is that we can authenticate with these APIs as the site owner, by calling them from a browser extension! So, that’s what I’ve been experimenting with, and it’s showing a lot of promise.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested in playing around with it, <a href="https://github.com/pento/free-as-in-speech">the experimental code is living in this repository</a>. It&#8217;s a simple proof of concept, capable of exporting the text content of a blog on a Wix site, showing that we can make a smooth, comprehensive, easy-to-use exporter for any Wix site owner.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="904" height="446" src="https://pento.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-20-at-5.26.38-pm.png" alt="Screenshot of the &quot;Free (as in Speech)&quot; browser extension UI." class="wp-image-5527" srcset="https://pento.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-20-at-5.26.38-pm.png 904w, https://pento.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-20-at-5.26.38-pm-300x148.png 300w, https://pento.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-20-at-5.26.38-pm-768x379.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /></figure>



<p>Clicking the export button starts a background script, which calls Wix&#8217;s REST APIs <em>as the site owner</em>, to get the original copy of the content. It then packages it up, and presents it as a WXR file to download.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="972" height="948" src="https://pento.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-20-at-5.27.38-pm.png" alt="Screenshot of a Firefox download dialog, showing a Wix site packaged up as a WXR file." class="wp-image-5528" srcset="https://pento.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-20-at-5.27.38-pm.png 972w, https://pento.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-20-at-5.27.38-pm-300x293.png 300w, https://pento.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-20-at-5.27.38-pm-768x749.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 972px) 100vw, 972px" /></figure>



<p>I&#8217;m really excited about how promising this experiment is. It can ultimately provide a full export of any Wix site, and we can add support for other CMS services that choose to artificially lock their customers in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where Can I Help?</h2>



<p>If you’re a designer or developer who’s excited about working on something new, head on over to the repository and <a href="https://github.com/pento/free-as-in-speech/issues">check out the open issues</a>: if there’s something that isn’t already covered, feel free to open a new issue.</p>



<p>Since this is new ground for a WordPress project, both technically and philosophically, I&#8217;d love to hear more points of view. It’s being discussed in <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/01/19/dev-chat-agenda-for-january-20-2021-january-21-2021/#comment-40563">the WordPress Core Dev Chat this week</a>, and you can also let me know what you think in the comments!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>While schemata are usually implemented using language-specific tools (eg, XML uses <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/xml/schema">XML Schema</a>, JSON uses <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>), they largely use the same concepts when talking about data. This is rather helpful, we don&#8217;t need to make a decision on <a href="https://pento.net/2021/01/19/wordpress-importers-getting-our-house-in-order/">data formats</a> before we can start thinking about how the data should be arranged.</p>



<p><em>Note: Since these concepts apply equally to all data formats, I&#8217;m using &#8220;WXR&#8221; in this post as shorthand for &#8220;the structured data section of whichever file format we ultimately use&#8221;, rather than specifically referring to the existing WXR format.</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why is a Schema Important?</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s fair to ask why, if the WordPress Importers have survived this entire time <em>without</em> a formal schema, why would we need one now?</p>



<p>There are two major reasons why we haven&#8217;t needed one in the past:</p>



<ul><li>WXR has remained largely unchanged in the last 10 years: there have been small additions or tweaks, but nothing significant. There&#8217;s been no need to keep track of changes.</li><li>WXR is currently very simple, with just a handful of basic elements. In a recent experiment, I was able to implement a JavaScript-based WXR generator in just a few days, entirely by referencing <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-admin/includes/export.php">the Core implementation</a>.</li></ul>



<p>These reasons are also why it would help to implement a schema for the future:</p>



<ul><li>As work on WXR proceeds, there will likely need to be substantial changes to what data is included: adding new fields, modifying existing fields, and removing redundant fields. Tracking these changes helps ensure any WXR implementations can stay in sync.</li><li>These changes will result in a more complex schema: relying on the source to re-implement it will become increasingly difficult and error-prone. Following Gutenberg&#8217;s lead, it&#8217;s likely that we&#8217;d want to provide official libraries in both PHP and JavaScript: keeping them in sync is best done from a source schema, rather than having one implementation copy the other.</li></ul>



<p>Taking the time to plan out a schema now gives us a solid base to work from, and it allows for future changes to happen in a reliable fashion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WXR for all of WordPress</h2>



<p>With a well defined schema, we can start to expand what data will be included in a WXR file.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Media</h3>



<p>Interestingly, many of the challenges around media files are less to do with WXR, and more to do with importer capabilities. The biggest headache is retrieving the actual files, which the importer currently handles by trying to retrieve the file from the remote server, as defined in the <code>wp:attachment_url</code> node. In context, this behaviour is understandable: 10+ years ago, personal internet connections were too slow to be moving media around, it was better to have the servers talk to each other. It&#8217;s a useful mechanism that we should keep as a fallback, but the more reliable solution is to include the media file with the export.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Plugins and Themes</h3>



<p>There are two parts to plugins and themes: the code, and the content. Modern WordPress sites <em>require</em> plugins to function, and most are customised to suit their particular theme.</p>



<p>For exporting the code, I wonder if a tiered solution could be applied:</p>



<ul><li>Anything from WordPress.org would just need their slug, since they can be re-downloaded during import. Particularly as WordPress continues to move towards an auto-updated future, modified versions of plugins and themes are explicitly not supported.</li><li>Third party plugins and themes would be given a filter to use, where they can provide a download URL that can be included in the export file.</li><li>Third party plugins/themes that don’t provide a download URL would either need to be skipped, or zipped up and included in the export file.</li></ul>



<p>For exporting the content, WXR already includes custom post types, but doesn&#8217;t include custom settings, or custom tables. The former should be included automatically, and the latter would likely be handled by an appropriate action for the plugin to hook into.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Settings</h3>



<p>There are a currently handful of special settings that are exported, but (as I just noted, particularly with plugins and themes being exported) this would likely need to be expanded to included most items in&nbsp;<code>wp_options</code>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Users</h3>



<p>Currently, the bare minimum information about users who’ve authored a post is included in the export. This would need to be expanded to include more user information, as well as users who aren’t post authors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WXR for <em>parts</em> of WordPress</h2>



<p>The modern use case for importers isn&#8217;t just to handle a full site, but to handle keeping sites in sync. For example, most news organisations will have a staging site (or even several layers of staging!) which is synchronised to production.</p>



<p>While it&#8217;s well outside the scope of this project to directly handle every one of these use cases, we should be able to provide the framework for organisations to build reliable platforms on. Exports should be repeatable, objects in the export should have unique identifiers, and the importer should be able to handle any subset of WXR.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">WXR Beyond WordPress</h2>



<p>Up until this point, we&#8217;ve really been talking about&nbsp;WordPress→WordPress migrations, but I think WXR is a useful format beyond that. Instead of just containing direct exports of the data from particular plugins, we could also allow it to contain &#8220;types&#8221; of data. This turns WXR into an intermediary language, exports can be created from any source, and imported into WordPress.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s consider an example. Say we create a tool that can export a Shopify, Wix, or GoDaddy site to WXR, how would we represent an online store in the WXR file? We don&#8217;t want to export in the format that any particular plugin would use, since a WordPress Core tool shouldn&#8217;t be advantaging one plugin over others.</p>



<p>Instead, it would be better if we could format the data in a platform-agnostic way, which plugins could then implement support for. As luck would have it, <a href="https://schema.org/">Schema.org</a> provides exactly the kind of data structure we could use here. It&#8217;s been <a href="https://schema.org/docs/releases.html">actively maintained for nearly nine years</a>, it supports a <a href="https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html">wide variety of data types</a>, and is intentionally platform-agnostic.</p>



<p>Gazing into my crystal ball for a moment, I can certainly imagine a future where plugins could implement and declare support for importing certain data types. When handling such an import (assuming one of those plugins wasn&#8217;t already installed), the WordPress Importer could offer them as options during the import process. This kind of seamless integration allows WordPress to show that it offers the same kind of fully-featured site building experience that modern CMS services do.</p>



<p>Of course, reality is never quite as simple as crystal balls and magic wands make them out to be. We have to contend with services that provide incomplete or fragmented exports, and there are even services that deliberately don&#8217;t provide exports at all. In the next post, I&#8217;ll be writing about why we should address this problem, and how we might be able to go about it.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://pento.net/2021/01/18/wordpress-importers-stating-the-problem/">previous post</a> talked about the broad problems we need to tackle to bring our importers up to speed, making them available for everyone to use.</p>



<p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to focus on what we could do with the existing technology, in order to give us the best possible framework going forward.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Reliable Base</h2>



<p>Importers are an interesting technical problem. Much like you&#8217;d expect from any backup/restore code, importers need to be extremely reliable. They need to comfortable handle all sorts of unusual data, and they need to keep it all safe. Particularly considering their age, the WordPress Importers do a remarkably good job of handling most content you can throw at it.</p>



<p>However, modern development practices have evolved and improved since the importers were first written, and we should certainly be making use of such practices, when they fit with our requirements.</p>



<p>For building reliable software that we expect to largely run by itself, a variety of comprehensive automated testing is critical. This ensures we can confidently take on the broader issues, safe in the knowledge that we have a reliable base to work from.</p>



<p>Testing <em>must</em> be the first item on this list. A variety of automated testing gives us confidence that changes are safe, and that the code can continue to be maintained in the future.</p>



<p>Data formats must be well defined. While this is useful for ensuring data can be handled in a predictable fashion, it&#8217;s also a very clear demonstration of our commitment to data freedom.</p>



<p>APIs for creating or extending importers should be straightforward for hooking into.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Performance Isn&#8217;t an Optional Extra</h3>



<p>With sites constantly growing in size (and with the export files potentially gaining a heap of extra data), we need to care about the performance of the importers.</p>



<p>Luckily, there&#8217;s already been some substantial work done on this front:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-make-wordpress-core wp-block-embed-make-wordpress-core"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QY1tHLBe4x"><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/11/18/wordpress-importer-redux/">WordPress Importer Redux</a></blockquote><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;WordPress Importer Redux&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core" src="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/11/18/wordpress-importer-redux/embed/#?secret=QY1tHLBe4x" data-secret="QY1tHLBe4x" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>There are other groups in the WordPress world who&#8217;ve made performance improvements in their own tools: gathering all of that experience is a relatively quick way to bring in production-tested improvements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The WXR Format</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s worth talking about the WXR format itself, and determining whether it&#8217;s the best option for handling exports into the future. XML-based formats are largely viewed as a relic of days gone past, so (if we were to completely ignore backwards compatibility for a moment) is there a modern data format that would work better?</p>



<p>The short answer&#8230; kind of. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>XML is actually well suited to this use case, and (particularly when looking at performance improvements) is the only data format for which PHP comes with a built-in streaming parser.</p>



<p>That said, WXR is basically an extension of the RSS format: as we add more data to the file that clearly doesn&#8217;t belong in RSS, there is likely an argument for defining an entirely WordPress-focused schema.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Alternative Formats</h3>



<p>It&#8217;s important to consider what the priorities are for our export format, which will help guide any decision we make. So, I&#8217;d like to suggest the following priorities (in approximate priority order):</p>



<ul><li><strong>PHP Support</strong>: The format should be natively supported in PHP, thought it is still workable if we need to ship an additional library.</li><li><strong>Performant</strong>: Particularly when looking at very large exports, it should be processed as quickly as possible, using minimal RAM.</li><li><strong>Supports Binary Files</strong>: <a href="https://pento.net/2021/01/18/wordpress-importers-stating-the-problem/#comment-37926">The first comments on my previous post</a> asked about media support, we clearly should be treating it as a first-class citizen.</li><li><strong>Standards Based</strong>: Is the format based on a documented standard? (Another way to ask this: are there multiple different implementations of the format? Do those implementations all function the same?</li><li><strong>Backward Compatible</strong>: Can the format be used by existing tools with no changes, or minimal changes?</li><li><strong>Self Descriptive</strong>: Does the format include information about what data you&#8217;re currently looking at, or do you need to refer to a schema?</li><li><strong>Human Readable</strong>: Can the file be opened and read in a text editor?</li></ul>



<p>Given these priorities, what are some options?</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">WXR (XML-based)</h4>



<p>Either the RSS-based schema that we already use, or a custom-defined XML schema, the arguments for this format are pretty well known.</p>



<p>One argument that hasn&#8217;t been well covered is how there&#8217;s a definite trade-off when it comes to supporting binary files. Currently, the importer tries to scrape the media file from the original source, which is not particularly reliable. So, if we were to look at including media files in the WXR file, the best option for storing them is to base64 encode them. Unfortunately, that would have a serious effect on performance, as well as readability: adding huge base64 strings would make even the smallest exports impossible to read.</p>



<p>Either way, this option would be mostly backwards compatible, though some tools may require a bit of reworking if we were to substantial change the schema.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">WXR (ZIP-based)</h4>



<p>To address the issues with media files, an alternative option might be to follow the path that Microsoft Word and OpenOffice use: put the text content in an XML file, put the binary content into folders, and compress the whole thing. </p>



<p>This addresses the performance and binary support problems, but is initially worse for readability: if you don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s a ZIP file, you can&#8217;t read it in a text editor. Once you unzip it, however, it does become quite readable, and has the same level of backwards compatibility as the XML-based format.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">JSON</h4>



<p>JSON could work as a replacement for XML in both of the above formats, with one additional caveat: there is no streaming JSON parser built in to PHP. There are 3rd party libraries available, but given <a href="http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php">the documented differences between JSON parsers</a>, I would be wary about using one library to produce the JSON, and another to parse it.</p>



<p>This format largely wouldn&#8217;t be backwards compatible, though tools which rely on the export file being plain text (eg, command line tools to do broad search-and-replaces on the file) can be modified relatively easily.</p>



<p>There are additional subjective arguments (both for and against) the readability of JSON vs XML, but I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s anything to them beyond personal preference.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">SQLite</h4>



<p>The <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> team wrote <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/affcase1.html">an interesting (indirect) argument</a> on this topic: OpenOffice uses a ZIP-based format for storing documents, the SQLite team argued that there would be benefits (particularly around performance and reliability) for OpenOffice to switch to SQLite.</p>



<p>They key issues that I see are:</p>



<ul><li>SQLite is included in PHP, but <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/sqlite3.installation.php">not enabled by default on Windows</a>.</li><li>While the SQLite team have a strong commitment to providing long-term support, SQLite is not a standard, and the only implementation is the one provided by the SQLite team.</li><li>This option is not backwards compatible at all.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">FlatBuffers</h4>



<p><a href="http://google.github.io/flatbuffers/">FlatBuffers</a> is an interesting comparison, since it&#8217;s a data format focussed entirely on speed. The down side of this focus is that it <em>requires</em> a defined schema to read the data. Much like SQLite, the only standard for FlatBuffers is the implementation. Unlike SQLite, FlatBuffers has made no commitments to providing long-term support.</p>

<p>As with any decision, this is a matter of trade-offs. I&#8217;m certainly interested in hearing additional perspectives on these options, or thoughts on options that I haven&#8217;t considered.</p>



<p>Regardless of which particular format we choose for storing WordPress exports, every format should have (or in the case of FlatBuffers, <em>requires</em>) a schema. We can talk about schemata without going into implementation details, so I&#8217;ll be writing about that in the next post.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s time to focus on the WordPress Importers.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not talking about tidying them up, or improve performance, or fixing some bugs, though these are certainly things that should happen. Instead, we need to consider their purpose, how they fit as a driver of WordPress&#8217; commitment to Open Source, and how they can be a key element in helping to keep the Internet Open and Free.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The History</h2>



<p>The WordPress Importers are arguably <em>the</em> key driver to WordPress&#8217; early success. Before the importer plugins existed (before WordPress even supported plugins!) there were a handful of <code>import-*.php</code> scripts in the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-admin?rev=688"><code>wp-admin</code> directory</a> that could be used to import blogs from other blogging platforms. When other platforms fell out of favour, WordPress already had an importer ready for people to move their site over. One of the most notable instances was in 2004, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/trunk/Content/Part%202/9-freedom-zero.md">when Moveable Type changed their license and prices</a>, suddenly requiring personal blog authors to pay for something that had previously been free. WordPress was fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right time: many of WordPress&#8217; earliest users came from Moveable Type.</p>



<p>As time went on, WordPress became well known in its own right. Growth relied less on people wanting to switch from another provider, and more on people choosing to start their site with WordPress. For <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13307">practical reasons</a>, the importers were moved out of WordPress Core, and into their own plugins. Since then, they&#8217;ve largely been in maintenance mode: bugs are fixed when they come up, but since export formats rarely change, they&#8217;ve just continued to work for all these years.</p>



<p>An unfortunate side effect of this, however, is that new importers are rarely written. While a new breed of services have sprung up over the years, the WordPress importers haven&#8217;t kept up.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The New Services</h2>



<p>There are many new CMS services that have cropped up in recent years, and we don&#8217;t have importers for any of them. WordPress.com has a few extra ones written, but they&#8217;ve been built on the WordPress.com infrastructure out of necessity.</p>



<p>You see, we&#8217;ve always assumed that other CMSes will provide some sort of export file that we can use to import into WordPress. That isn&#8217;t always the case, however. Some services (notable, <a href="https://support.wix.com/en/article/exporting-or-embedding-your-wix-site-elsewhere">Wix</a> and <a href="https://godaddy.com/community/Websites-Marketing-Website/Exporting-Website-Builder-Site-to-Word-Press/td-p/124526">GoDaddy Website Builder</a>) deliberately don&#8217;t allow you to export your own content. Other services provide incomplete or fragmented exports, needlessly forcing stress upon site owners who want to use their own content outside of that service.</p>



<p>To work around this, WordPress.com has implemented importers that effectively scrape the site: while this has worked to some degree, it does require regular maintenance, and the importer has to do a lot of guessing about how the content should be transformed. This is clearly not a solution that would be maintainable as a plugin.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group alignwide is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-center">Problem Number 4</p>



<p class="alignwide has-extra-large-font-size"><strong>Some services work against their customers, and actively prevent site owners from controlling their own content.</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>This strikes at the heart of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/#bill-of-rights">WordPress Bill of Rights</a>. WordPress is built with fundamental freedoms in mind: all of those freedoms point to owning your content, and being able to make use of it in any form you like. When a CMS actively works against providing such freedom to their community, I would argue that we have an obligation to help that community out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A Variety of Content</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s worth discussing how, when starting a modern CMS service, the bar for success is very high. You can&#8217;t get away with just providing a basic CMS: you need to provide all the options. Blogs, eCommerce, mailing lists, forums, themes, polls, statistics, contact forms, integrations, embeds, the list goes on. The closest comparison to modern CMS services is&#8230; the <em>entire</em> WordPress ecosystem: built on WordPress core, but with the myriad of plugins and themes available, along with the variety of services offered by a huge array of companies.</p>



<p>So, when we talk about the importers, we need to consider how they&#8217;ll be used.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group alignwide is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-center">Problem Number 3</p>



<p class="alignwide has-extra-large-font-size"><strong>To import from a modern CMS service into WordPress, your importer needs to map from service features to WordPress plugins.</strong></p>
</div></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Getting Our Own House In Order</h2>



<p>Some of these problems don&#8217;t just apply to new services, however.</p>



<p>Out of the box, WordPress exports to WXR (WordPress eXtended RSS) files: an XML file that contains the <em>content</em> of the site. Back when WXR was first created, this was all you really needed, but much like the rest of the WordPress importers, it hasn&#8217;t kept up with the times. A modern WordPress site isn&#8217;t just the sum of its content: a WordPress site has plugins and themes. It has various options configured, it has huge quantities of media, it has masses of text content, far more than the first WordPress sites ever had.  </p>



<div class="wp-block-group alignwide is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-center">Problem Number 2</p>



<p class="alignwide has-extra-large-font-size"><strong>WXR doesn&#8217;t contain a full export of a WordPress site.</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>In my view, WXR is a solid format for handling exports. An XML-based system is quite capable of containing all forms of content, so it&#8217;s reasonable that we could expand the WXR format to contain the entire site.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Built for the Future</h2>



<p>If there&#8217;s one thing we can learn from the history of the WordPress importers, it&#8217;s that maintenance will potentially be sporadic. Importers are unlikely to receive the same attention that the broader WordPress Core project does, owners may come and go. An importer will get attention if it breaks, of course, but it otherwise may go months or years without changing.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group alignwide is-style-twentytwentyone-border"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-center">Problem Number 1</p>



<p class="alignwide has-extra-large-font-size"><strong>We can&#8217;t depend on regular importer maintenance in the future.</strong></p>
</div></div>



<p>It&#8217;s quite possible to build code that will be running in 10+ years: we see examples all across the WordPress ecosystem. Doing it in a reliable fashion needs to be a deliberate choice, however.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What&#8217;s Next?</h2>



<p>Having worked our way down from the larger philosophical reasons for the importers, to some of the more technically-oriented implementation problems; I&#8217;d like to work our way back out again, focussing on each problem individually. In the following posts, I&#8217;ll start laying out how I think we can bring our importers up to speed, prepare them for the future, and make them available for everyone.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to be nuanced in 280 characters.</p>



<p>The Twitter character limit is a major factor of what can make it so much fun to use: you can read, publish, and interact, in extremely short, digestible chunks. But, it doesn&#8217;t fit every topic, ever time. Sometimes you want to talk about complex topics, having honest, thoughtful discussions. In an environment that encourages hot takes, however, it&#8217;s often easier to just avoid having those discussions. I can&#8217;t blame people for doing that, either: I find myself taking extended breaks from Twitter, as it can easily become overwhelming.</p>



<p>For me, the exception is Twitter threads.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Twitter threads encourage nuance and creativity.</h2>



<p>Creative masterpieces like this Choose Your Own Adventure are not just possible, they rely on Twitter threads being the way they are.</p>

<p>And Tumblr screenshot threads are always fun to read, even when they take a turn for the epic (over 4000 tweets in this thread, and it isn&#8217;t slowing down!)</p>

<p>Everyone can think of threads that they&#8217;ve loved reading.</p>



<p>My point is, threads are wildly underused on Twitter. I think I big part of that is the UI for writing threads: while it&#8217;s suited to writing a thread as a series of related tweet-sized chunks, it doesn&#8217;t lend itself to writing, revising, and editing anything more complex.</p>



<p>To help make this easier, I&#8217;ve been working on a tool that will help you publish an entire post to Twitter from your WordPress site, as a thread. It takes care of transforming your post into Twitter-friendly content, you can just&#8230; write. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>It doesn&#8217;t just handle the tweet embeds from earlier in the thread: it handles handle uploading and attaching any images and videos you&#8217;ve included in your post.</p>

<p>As React (via Gutenberg) becomes more present in the WordPress world, I&#8217;m seeing some common themes pop up in conversations about it. I spoke a bit about this kind of thing at WordCamp US last year, but if you don&#8217;t feel like sitting through a half hour video, let me summarise my thoughts. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>I agree that React is hard. I <em>strongly</em> disagree with the commonly contrasted view that HTML, CSS, PHP, or vanilla JavaScript are easy. They&#8217;re all just as hard to work with as React, sometimes more-so, particularly when having to deal with the exciting world of cross-browser compatibility.</p>



<p>The advantage that PHP has over modern JavaScript development isn&#8217;t that it&#8217;s easy, or that the tooling is better, or more reliable, or anything like that. The advantage is that it&#8217;s familiar. If you&#8217;re new to web development, React is just as easy anything else to start with.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Something I’m seeing a lot.<br><br>Beginners: This makes sense, we understand it.<br><br>Experienced developers: There’s no way beginners would understand it. It’s not like &lt;a thing I learned ten years ago&gt;.</p>&mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) <a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1096784072943300608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2019</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>I&#8217;m honestly shocked when someone manages to wade through the mess of tooling (even pre-Gutenberg) to contribute to WordPress. It&#8217;s such an incomprehensible, thankless, unreliable process, the tenacity of anyone who makes it out the other side should be applauded. That said, this high barrier is unacceptable.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been working in this industry for long enough to have forgotten the number of iterations of my personal development environment I&#8217;ve gone through, to get to where I can set up something for myself which <em>isn&#8217;t awful</em>. React wasn&#8217;t around for all of that time, so that can&#8217;t be the reason web development has been hard for as long as I remember. What is, then?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Doing Better</h2>



<p>Over the past year or so, I&#8217;ve been tinkering with a tool to help deal with the difficulties of contributing to WordPress. That tool is called <a href="https://github.com/pento/testpress/">TestPress</a>, it&#8217;s getting pretty close to being usable, at least on MacOS. Windows support is a little less reliable, but getting better. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> If you enjoy tinkering with tools, too, you&#8217;re welcome to try out the development version, but it does still has some bugs in it. Feedback and PRs are always welcome! There are some screenshots in <a href="https://github.com/pento/testpress/issues/114">this issue</a> that give an idea of what the experience is like, if you&#8217;d like to check it out that way.</p>



<p>TestPress is not a panacea: at best, it&#8217;s an attempt at levelling the playing field a little bit. You shouldn&#8217;t need years of experience to build a reliable development environment, that should be the bare minimum we provide.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">React is part of the solution</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s still a lot of work to do to make web development something that anyone can easily get into. I think React is part of the solution to this, however.</p>



<p>React isn&#8217;t without its problems, of course. Modern JavaScript can encourage iteration for the sake of iteration. Certainly, there&#8217;s a drive to React-ify All The Things (a trap I&#8217;m guilty of falling into, as well). React&#8217;s development model is fundamentally different to that of vanilla JavaScript or jQuery, which is why it can seem incomprehensible if you&#8217;re already well versed in the old way of doing things: it requires a shift in your mental model of how JavaScript works. This is a hard problem to solve, but it&#8217;s not insurmountable.</p>



<p>Perhaps a little controversially, I <em>don&#8217;t</em> think that React is guilty of causing the web to become less accessible. At worst, it&#8217;s continuing the long standing practice of web standards making accessibility an optional extra. Building anything beyond a basic, non-interactive web page with just HTML and CSS will inevitably cause accessibility issues, unless you happen to be familiar with the mystical combinations of accessible tags, or applying aria attributes, or styling your content in just the right way (and none of the wrong ways).</p>



<p>React (or any component-based development system, really) can improve accessibility for everyone, and we&#8217;re seeing this with Gutenberg already. By providing a set of base components for plugin and theme authors to use, we can ensure the correct HTML is produced for screen readers to work with. Much like desktop and mobile app developers don&#8217;t need to do anything to make their apps accessible (because it&#8217;s baked into the APIs they use to build their apps), web developers should have the same experience, regardless of the complexity of the app they&#8217;re building.</p>



<p>Arguing that accessibility needs to be part of the design process is the wrong argument. Accessibility shouldn&#8217;t be a consideration, it should be unavoidable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do Better</h2>



<p>Now, can we do better? Absolutely. There&#8217;s always room for improvement. People shouldn&#8217;t need to learn React if they don&#8217;t want to. They shouldn&#8217;t have to deal with the complexities of the WCAG. They should have the freedom to tinker, and the reassurance that they can tinker without breaking everything.</p>



<p>The pre-React web didn&#8217;t arrive in its final form, all clean, shiny, and perfect. It took decades of evolution to get there. The post-React web needs some time to evolve, too, but it has the benefit of hindsight: we can compress the decades of evolving into a much shorter time period, provide a fresh start for those who want it, while also providing backwards compatibility with the existing ways of doing things.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/">WebAuthn</a> is now a W3C recommendation, bringing us one step closer to not having to use passwords anymore. If you&#8217;re not familiar with WebAuthn, <a href="https://webauthn.io/">here&#8217;s a little demo</a> (if you don&#8217;t own a security key, it&#8217;ll probably work best on an Android phone with a fingerprint reader).</p>



<p>That I needed to add a disclaimer for the demo indicates the state of WebAuthn authenticator support. It&#8217;s nice when it works, but it&#8217;s clearly still in progress, and <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=webauthn">that progress varies</a>. WebAuthn also doesn&#8217;t cover how the authenticator device works, that falls under the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-ps-20190130-pub/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-ps-20190130.html">proposed CTAP standard</a>. They work together to form the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2 Project</a>. Currently, the most reliable option is to purchase a security key, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235173/the-best-hardware-security-keys-yubico-titan-key-u2f">quality varies wildly</a>, and needing to carry around an extra dongle just for logging in to sites is no fun.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What WordPress Needs</h2>



<p>Anything that replaces passwords needs to provide some extra benefit, without losing the strengths of the password model:</p>



<ul><li>Passwords are universally understood as an authentication model.</li><li>They&#8217;re portable: you don&#8217;t need a special app or token to use them anywhere.</li><li>They&#8217;re extendable: strong passwords can be enforced as needed. Additional authentication (2FA codes, for example) can be added, too.</li></ul>



<p>Magic login links are an interesting step in this direction. The WordPress mobile apps added <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2017/08/15/an-updated-login-coming-to-the-wordpress-mobile-apps/">magic login support for WordPress.com accounts</a> a while ago, I&#8217;d love to see this working on all WordPress sites. </p>



<p>A WebAuthn-based model would be a wonderful future step, once the entire user experience is more polished.</p>



<p>The password-less future hasn&#8217;t quite arrived yet, but we&#8217;re getting closer.</p>
