They also share their personal stories of how they got started with WordPress and how their experiences have shaped their approach to plugin development. This episode is a must-listen for anyone interested in developing WordPress plugins, especially if you are looking to improve your development process and create more user-friendly plugins.</p><p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Building a successful plugin requires a deep understanding of user needs and pain points: </strong>Understanding your users' needs and pain points to develop a plugin that solves their problems effectively is critical. This requires continuous user testing and feedback to improve functionality and user experience.</li><li><strong>Collaboration and communication are crucial for plugin development: </strong>Plugin development is a team effort that requires effective communication, collaboration, and project management.

They highlight accessibility as a non-negotiable aspect of web development and provide guidance for leaders, developers, and designers to ensure your websites are accessible to all people.</p><p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Why Value Accessibility? </strong>Accessibility ensures all people have access to the things we create. It can‚Äôt be an afterthought or something for the web dev team to figure out. It must drive the entire creative process and serve as an anchor to ground our teams and our work.</li><li><strong>Requirement vs. Challenge.</strong> Most creative projects work within a set of requirements. These don‚Äôt prohibit the creative process. Instead, they challenge us to enhance the things we build and make them better than we might have without thinking through and within these constraints.</li><li><strong>It‚Äôs All Around Us.</strong> We think of accessibility as a new idea, but in so many spaces, it‚Äôs the norm. We have curb cutouts and braille signage. We see this every day, so tech is catching up.</li><li>Improving Usability. Developing through the lens of accessibility means delivering experiences that solve people‚Äôs problems and help them with tasks.</li><li><strong>It Takes Tools.</strong> The creative and engineering are just rails. Utilizing tools to ensure accessibility when publishing and setting up processes and guidelines will equip you to flex as requirements change. It‚Äôs necessary for your organization to resource accessibility for it to be done effectively.</li></ul><h3>üîó Mentioned in the show<strong>:</strong></h3><ul><li><a href="https://tri.be/">Modern Tribe</a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo.com/148927676">Eric Meyer</a></li><li><a href="https://myspace.com/">MySpace</a></li></ul><h3>üê¶ You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:</h3><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisMKindred">Chris Kindred</a> (Director of Backend Development, <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernTribeAgcy">Modern Tribe</a>)</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahgless">Sarah Gless</a> (Creative Director, <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernTribeAgcy">Modern Tribe</a>)</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/mjklanac">Mike Klanac</a> (Director of Business Development, <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernTribeAgcy">Modern Tribe</a>)</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/corymiller303">Cory Miller</a> (CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/post_status">Post Status</a>)</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/lemonadecode">Olivia Bisset</a> (Intern, <a href="https://twitter.com/post_status">Post Status</a>)</li></ul><p>The <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. üìù<br /><br /><a href="https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/" target="_blank">Browse our archives</a>, and don‚Äôt forget to subscribe via <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008" target="_blank">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA" target="_blank">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast" target="_blank">Stitcher</a>, <a href="https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/" target="_blank">Simplecast</a>, or <a href="https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P">RSS</a>. üéß</p>

AdSanity is a successful example of this, and the team is working on dedicating more resources towards the product to even out development between the two sides of their business. However, it can be difficult to maintain free plugins without generating revenue, and it's important to consider how to incorporate them into the business model.</li><li><strong>Value vs. Spam in Advertising</strong>. For many people, advertising has become a four-letter word, so there is a need to help customers become good advertisers rather than just spamming ads everywhere. It‚Äôs critical to empower your visitors by explaining the importance of creating a community around the site to allow for more meaningful conversations with visitors.</li><li><strong>The Point of Free Plugins</strong>. Building free plugins is more about passion and community engagement than being a lead generator. The main outcome has been connecting with people within the WordPress community, but those connections remember to come to you for solutions. So the increased exposure can lead to revenue in the long term.</li></ul><p>üôè Sponsor: <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/en-ca/pro/hub-dashboard?utm_source=events_sponsor_page&utm_medium=events&utm_campaign=en-us_events_prd_awa_partners_part_poststatus_2022_001">GoDaddy Pro</a>¬†</p><p>Top-Tier Managed WordPress hosting solutions for Enterprise, the Public Sector, and Media companies.

After working as a software developer, he transitioned into WordPress and founded his own agency, <a href="https://devrix.com/">DevriX</a>.

Several other industries utilize retainers because they provide consistent revenue and secure client commitment for ongoing work. The entire world is living around monthly costs. Not aligning your service-based business with that model is counterintuitive. Essentially it is just selling hours in bulk, turning services into products.

      <title>Interview With Product Lead Tiffany Bridge At Nexcess</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/tiffany">Tiffany Bridge</a> has been working in WordPress almost since the beginning of WordPress. She is the Product Manager for WordPress eCommerce at <a href="https://twitter.com/nexcess">Nexcess</a> and talks with Cory Miller about their hosting services and products, specifically highlighting the benefits and capabilities of Store Builder. They dive into optimizing UX in WordPress, the benefits of open source, and more.</p><p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>WooCommerce Simplified with Store Builder. </strong>As you know, WordPress and WooCommerce love to hide settings in layers of menus. Nexcess saw the struggles people had in trying to set up eCommerce sites and created StoreBuilder as an easy tool to go from zero to having an online store. This removes the initial learning curve required to get started in Woo and sets up a DIY tool for merchants.</li><li><strong>A Platform to Grow with You: </strong>One of the great things about setting people up on WordPress and Woo as they start businesses is the flexibility available for future growth. If their model totally shifts, they can just uninstall a plugin and add another to obtain the functionality they need to sustain their business growth without the hassle of migration or the increased fees of a platform.</li><li><strong>Solving for What Users Shouldn‚Äôt Have to Know. </strong>Kadence and so many WordPress and WooCommerce plugins are designed for WordPress professionals. We are working to leverage the power of Kadence by creating a top-notch user experience for people who don‚Äôt know what things like a border radius or gutter are. These tools enhance and expand the power of WordPress, so creating solutions that lower the knowledge barrier to entry is the kind of work that moves WordPress forward.</li><li><strong>You Can Own Your Own Platform. </strong>Often people aren‚Äôt aware that this is an option. From Etsy to Twitter, controversies tend to increase demand for alternatives. Bringing more awareness to individual ownership on the web-for blogs, stores, or anything else-empowers people to show up online and conduct business on their terms.</li></ul><p><strong>üôè Sponsor: </strong><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/en-ca/pro/hub-dashboard?utm_source=events_sponsor_page&utm_medium=events&utm_campaign=en-us_events_prd_awa_partners_part_poststatus_2022_001"><strong>GoDaddy Pro</strong></a></p><p>Manage your clients, websites, and tasks from a single dashboard with <strong>GoDaddy Pro</strong>.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of¬†<strong>Post Status Draft</strong>, Cory is joined by¬†<strong>D'nelle Dowis</strong>, CEO of¬†<strong>Berry Interesting Productions</strong>.

      <title>Tom Willmot on the Challenges and Opportunities Facing Enterprise WordPress ‚Äî Post Status Draft 130</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tom Willmot</strong> has been a WordPress pioneer and leader in the agency space since co-founding <strong>Human Made</strong> in 2010. Just in the past year, <strong>Human Made</strong> has more than doubled its size with a team of 100. Tom is also CEO and co-founder of <strong>Altis DXP</strong>, Human Made's enterprise WordPress digital experience platform. I caught up with Tom this week to find out what he's thinking about the challenges and opportunities of the enterprise market for WordPress agencies today.</p><p>Sparked by <strong>Magne Ilsaas</strong>'s ideas in <a href="https://poststatus.com/the-wordpress-enterprise-paradox/">The WordPress Enterprise Paradox</a>, Tom started <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwillmot/status/1589919739643834370">a Twitter thread</a> and hosted a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1OwxWwmOeykxQ?s=20">live discussion</a> this week about the challenges of not having a well-defined brand and market for enterprise WordPress. In the minds of clients beyond the WordPress and open-source community not to mention unhelpful tech industry analysts, "WordPress" is something you can buy, and it's often confused with any number of related brands: <strong>Automattic</strong>, <strong>WordPress VIP</strong>, and managed WordPress hosts that support enterprise clients.</p><p>After getting an outline of the problem as it stands today, I asked Tom what might help differentiate "Enterprise WordPress" as a collective or entire ecosystem of agencies operating within it. Can open-source values of sharing and cooperation shape a unique global identity for enterprise WordPress agencies? Is it time for an inter-agency association or "guild" to take on these challenges? (Human Made has <a href="https://handbook.hmn.md/working-here/guilds/">an internal "guild" structure of cross-functional teams</a> ‚Äî what could it look like to extend them across the whole agency space?)</p><p>And how might that look within the WordPress ecosystem and others adjacent to it? Are more inter-agency gatherings needed along with greater participation in existing tech and design conferences? Will agencies like Human Made resume hosting conferences like their Day and Week of REST events in the past? Can the larger WordCamps cater to an enterprise track? Does Enterprise WordPress need its own conferences?

      <title>Post Status Excerpt (No. 72) ‚Äî Can We Get to &quot;Yes&quot; on Better UX?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>Can We Get to ‚ÄúYes‚Äù on Better UX?</h2><p>What does WordPress need to do to appeal more to do-it-yourself website builders and creators who are trying to take a business, hobby, or side project online? This week in an article he shared in <a href="https://poststatus.com/#choose-membership"><strong>Post Status Slack</strong></a>, <strong>Eric Karkovack</strong> suggested <a href="https://speckyboy.com/can-wordpress-appeal-to-diy-markets/">some ways to improve the WordPress user experience</a>, especially for DIY users setting up a website for the first time.</p><p>We also have lists of plugins we disrecommend ‚Äî to the point that it's a dealbreaker if a client insists on using them. And of course, these lists change a lot over time.¬†</p><blockquote><p>We all know these things ‚Äî but it's a kind of ‚Äúopen secret‚Äù within professional WordPress circles. That's understandable! Comparison is the thief of joy ‚Äî and possibly revenue.</p></blockquote><p>Some of the things Eric wants to see happen, like a standard interface for plugins and a curated view of the plugin ecosystem, are similar to views commonly expressed by designers, developers, and people in other professional roles at WordPress agencies serving enterprise clients. And why not? In the WordPress enterprise space, are the end users really that much different than mass-market WordPress users in what they <i>don't</i> need to know or see ‚Äî and what they do need to perform routine content creation and management tasks as easily as possible?¬†</p><p>That's where my thinking has been lately, so I had a conversation with Eric to see if we might identify areas where nearly everyone thinks WordPress offers a poor experience and how they might align themselves toward solutions. Can we get everyone to ‚Äúyes‚Äù on a better UX?</p><h2>Don't Play Favorites ‚Äî Recognize Excellence</h2><p>Standardizing admin interfaces and notifications might be easier than figuring out how to curate best-of-breed themes and plugins. But imagine, as Eric and I do in this conversation, some kind of ‚Äúplugin quality score‚Äù at wordpress.org based on neutral, objective data. It might be ‚Äúgamed‚Äù ‚Äî in a positive way. It would encourage developers to do better, deeper, ever-maturing work.</p><p>Personally, I'd like to see the maximum and the average number of queries a plugin adds to a page. That, along with PHP and WordPress versions that have been tested for compatibility (existing features of the plugin repository) would be key code quality indicators. Frequency of updates, reviews, and support responses would indicate a capacity for long-term sustainability. Raising <a href="https://poststatus.com/we-dont-need-no-stinkin-standards/">standards for testing aimed mainly at security</a> would be great too. All of this could be done or encouraged by key players in the WordPress ecosystem coming together to set standards for their industry. It would impact how all users of the plugin directory understand quality.</p><h2>Don't Hide it from the Noobs: Too Many Open Secrets About Quality are Bad for Everyone</h2><p>As of today, there are 60,153 un-curated free plugins at wordpress.org that can only be explored via external search and a limited (<a href="https://poststatus.com/a-visit-from-the-good-idea-fairy/">arguably broken</a>) site search tool. WordPress professionals with high-end client services would never expose their customers to this chaos ‚Äî so why does the WordPress community expose its newcomers to it? Anyone who has developed WordPress sites for very long has a list of plugins they prefer, particularly in combination with each other, for common feature sets and use cases. We also have lists of plugins we dis-recommend ‚Äî to the point that it's a deal breaker if a client insists on using them. And of course, these lists change a lot over time.¬†</p><p>We all know these things ‚Äî but it's a kind of ‚Äúopen secret‚Äù from professional WordPress circles. That's understandable! Comparison is the thief of joy ‚Äî and possibly revenue. But we need to be more open and better at communicating these things in a problem-solving, always-learning way within appropriate channels. Open source security is a different issue, but <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards">performance and code quality standards</a> ‚Äî and the products/people who follow them in exemplary ways ‚Äî should be much more visible and celebrated.</p><p>(What if someone did a tutorial series walking through current WordPress code standards and the <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-coding-standards-has-reached-a/">history</a> of <a href="https://poststatus.com/accessibility-draft-standards-are-ready-for-review/">their</a> <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-coding-standards-1-2-1-has-been/">evolution</a>?)</p><p>Information that maturing developers and product owners can learn from to improve their work doesn't trickle down as openly or as easily as it should. It's inside baseball, and it shouldn't be quite so insider-y. It's not out there alongside independent <a href="https://poststatus.com/kevin-ohashi-deep-history-and-integrity-in-hosting-benchmarks/">plugin performance reviews</a> or clear standards and guidance for anyone who wants them.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>What are the barriers?</p><p>Who can lift them?</p><p>Industry peers and WordPress community members working together on common interests?</p><p>As we end up saying in our conversation, we hope so.</p><img src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gdpro800x500-1-300x188.png" alt="GoDaddy Pro" /><h3>‚ú® Sponsor: <a href="https://poststat.us/godaddypro">GoDaddy Pro</a></h3><p>Manage your clients, websites, and tasks from a single dashboard with <strong>GoDaddy Pro</strong>.

What can WordPress do to appeal to the do it yourself market? , what brought that topic up for you this week, Eric?</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> I think it's a combination of things. For one, you know, we have full site editing that's been around for a little bit now, and, you know, we're not seeing like huge adoption rates with it.</p><p>We're getting people to, um, you know, kind of learn what's involved with that and block themes and, um, [00:02:00] and also at the same time we're, you know, the, the changes that we've seen, The block editor over time and you know, even the, kind of, the genesis of that project I think was to kind of compete with, um, more.</p><p>Content management systems, kind of like, you know, WS or Squarespace and what have you. Um, and it seems like WordPress is just going toward that market more and more as they, as they build on. And so I thought those were really nice steps in that direction, right? So we have tools that. Make it a little bit easier for someone who maybe isn't, uh, familiar with code to go in and and build a, a site.</p><p>But that led me to think about, well, what else should we be doing in that area? What else could WordPress do to make it. Uh, as foolproof as possible, um, to build a basic site, not something necessarily like, um, you know, a complex, you know, high end enterprise site, [00:03:00] but just something basic that someone can do within a couple of hours.</p><p>So that really kind of where that, the post came from.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Have you seen the, uh, videos where Jamie Marsland and, uh, who else did this had, had their daughters or, Um, I think of very different ages too, but it tried to do exactly that. And, um, he had, he had his kids do, um, um, Elementor versus Gutenberg, I think it was.</p><p>Yeah. Yeah. And that was, that was interesting. I mean, you really have to. That totally someone totally different from you, um, using it for the first time and Yeah, I think, I think a lot of, um, thought has gone into that user experience is, is huge. Uh, now, of course, always, always should have been, but um, Gutenberg is, is very squarely focused on the, on the user experience, building out your, your site and, and [00:04:00] pages.</p><p>And, um, my, my thought though was everyone wants that. Um, it's not just the mass market, the lower and middle end, um, of that, but, um, agencies to up. The, uh, those that are serving enterprise, enterprise clients, uh, WordPress, v i p partners, um, I hear, I hear the same things from them, like, you know, even very recent conversations, um, about.</p><p>How having standard interface that doesn't throw you different, totally different screens when you use, uh, a plugin in the back end. Um, that's a, a con basic design principle of there's much less cognitive load on you when the navigation is standard. Even if you've never used WordPress before, um, [00:05:00] you.</p><p>You're f it seems familiar because things are intuitively laid out. Cause it's, it's like a lot of other things. WordPress is, is old enough and in so influential that it's, it's, uh, backend interface has been copied in a lot of ways. It's very, very familiar. Um, interestingly, even if people haven't used it.</p><p>Um, so when you hit a plugin with, you know, crazy level of setting screens or its own interface design, um, that's not, that doesn't. Look good with, uh, with anyone really, but with a enterprise client. I, I think that's an issue. That's one of the things you talk about in here. Um, Yeah, we have you thought about that at all?</p><p>Um, how, Yeah. Pretty much every market, every WordPress market, uh, could benefit from.</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> It's, it's funny you mentioned that cuz I really wasn't thinking of like the enterprise clients. And I [00:06:00] think the reason for that is because usually if I have a client who's a little more higher end on the, on the price scale, I'm usually building things to kind of account for all of that right?</p><p>Where I can, I mean, obviously I can't change a in ui, but I can certainly do things with custom fields or blocks or what have you to try and make the, the content creation and editing process. Simple as possible for them. So by, by doing some of these things at core level, you would take away the need to build all that extra stuff on top to, you know, to make it easier for the corporate client to use.</p><p>So I think it, it, it goes together pretty well. Um, The one example in terms of UI that I have in the article is, uh, you know, just looking at the standard WordPress settings page. We have the reading settings, and then next to it I have, uh, the opening screen of slider Revolution, which is, uh, plugin bundled with [00:07:00] a bunch of different schemes and, uh, like a theme forest, what have you.</p><p>Um, it's like a completely different thing. And to, to that end, even Elementor is as well, I mean the, a lot of. Popular page builder plugins basically take over, uh, the UI and it's like you're in a completely different planet. And think about if you're a brand new user and you've got just Elementor or Slider Revolution on your site, you bought this theme and it comes with these things, you're kind of thinking you're dropped into a middle of Mars or something.</p><p>You're not sure what, you know how to get back to where you were and what the difference is between. You know, that UI based versus, you know, the, the core WordPress ui. Uh, in a lot of ways that doesn't make sense. So I think that's something we have to try and unify. Um, I don't know how we go about doing that at the core level.</p><p>Um, but I, I think if we make core as clean as possible, maybe that's at [00:08:00] least a good start.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, there were, there would have to be, um, some, some standards in reusable. Patterns and, and tools. Um, I, I think that in the long run, the, uh, Gutenberg is, is supposed to eat the entire, you know, it's, it's a true ship of Tesus project where the entire thing gets rebuilt while moving.</p><p>Um, And in, in some way it will be a, the goal is, is to have a unified experience at the end of that, just how quickly that happens depends on, on core contribution. Um, on the velocity of that, um, Yeah, that's for lack of that. I, I think it's, um, it's a bad experience for everyone and Sure. Uh, uh, an enterprise client is really just at bottom end users, uh, employees who have as much experience maybe as the average DIY site builder, a [00:09:00] creator, someone who wants to start a podcast or, or sell a product, um, as a side project or something like that.</p><p>There's, there's really no difference there. Everyone, um, has the same, uh, usability needs in general, and more or less, there's, there's big differences when you, you started talking about compliance needs with accessibility and, and so on and, and things like that. But, um, yeah, it seems like to me that there, there's a lot of opportunity for aligning, um, different parts of, of the word.</p><p>Community and business community where. Plug in. Developers and owners should really want this. The same thing that, uh, agency people, um, do. And that's, they, they support each other. Um, they feed each other business. So I, I'm curious why. That hasn't [00:10:00] happened, and it seems to me like there's some information flows or I don't know.</p><p>There there are probably other, other sticky barriers. Have you, did you, did that question come up for you at all? Why? Um, why?</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Well, I know it's like, it's something we've talked about a little bit, right? I mean, yeah, just on, on a few different levels and with the, uh, you know, Active install data going away from wordpress.org, and maybe these folks need to band together a little more and, and share amongst each other.</p><p>I, I think the reason it hasn't happened yet is because it really hasn't had to, um, you know, maybe they haven't seen necessarily the benefit of it, but when you see kind of the, the yeah. Jumble of the, the UI right now and how it, how different it can be depending on what you have installed. You know, maybe there is something that, you know, some of these larger plugin developers could work together on.</p><p>Sure. Uh, it makes sense. You know, it makes sense for all of them. I mean, [00:11:00] I, I, I somehow see us heading towards some sort of consortium of, of, uh, folks who, who can't necessarily write strict standards, but maybe they have certain. You know, broad outlines of, of what they, they want to, to abide by. And, you know, the more people that do that, the better I think it is for WordPress users and for just really everyone involved, because the software's going to be easier to use and more uniform.</p><p>Right.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. There's, there's a lot that the, um, that, that part of the community could do for itself. I've, uh, Tried to be more vocal about, but I, I think there, there have been a few, few voices behind those ideas of you, Hey, you, there's a lot you can do, um, to shape your own industry. Um, Yeah, if you do have a shared, a shared interface framework and, um, formal or informal standards for [00:12:00] Yeah, we were talking about.</p><p>Admin notifications previously. Um, that's part of it. Um, it, it'd save you a lot of time if there was a base to build on. Um, more than, more than I think exists now. Um, so that, uh, anyone starting, starting out creating a, a new plugin, um, would have some kind of, uh, head start. Really a standard interface or, or guidance at least.</p><p>I don't know that there's that much, um, public information. And, uh, it's curious to me as, as, uh, as things like the W Commerce, um, partnership program kind of is a bit, looks like, a bit like a, getting into, uh, a relationship with WordPress, v i p. Um, there's criteria to go through, uh, that you have, well you have to meet, um, to become, um, a preferred agency working.</p><p>Um, with w commerce.com side with [00:13:00] automatic, um, what those criteria are and what the standards are, should I think, have some kind of trickle down effect, like know what they are and, um, and have them as at least aspirational for everyone. Um, there's been some talk in, in, uh, core of, um, bringing. Some changes on, uh, on standards and testing for, uh, coding, um, coding standards for security.</p><p>Uh, I think primarily performance and security. Um, and I hope those continue to get prioritized that that's what all seems, seems to need to happen to, um, to move this forward. But the one point you mentioned, um, where you're talking about modernizing the onboarding experience, Where you direct people to, where to find themes, where to find plugins that, uh, [00:14:00] that becomes challenging and touches, touches.</p><p>This other recent issue we've talked about, um, it is hard to search in the, in the plugin repository is not in an ideal state and people who are trying to sell. Their plugins there, um, have a number of frustrations with, with trying to surface their, their products as relevant to what people are searching for.</p><p>Um, do you think this could be part of a solution to that if, or a potential conflict point when you're curating, you're, you're curating and recommending, um, certain ones?</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Well, I think as far as, as core goes, um, my idea is more. Just pointing people to the repositories. Mm-hmm. , uh, for themes and plugins, not necessarily being a, uh, a [00:15:00] curator, but, um, I, I, I see the, you know, I see there, there, there should be more impetus to improve the, the repositories and make them easier for folks to search and figure out what it is they're getting and what, you know, um, allow new entries to be a little more, uh, visible.</p><p>But I think they're kind of separate things, you know, just to be able to, I mean, if, if you're installing WordPress now from the, you know, from, from your host, or if you're, you know, FTPing it up to your site, old school style, um, you know, you're, you're gonna get this little. Widget did on the, on the front screen of the dashboard that welcomes you to WordPress and gives you a few handy links, but it doesn't really tell you about how to actually use what you're, you've got.</p><p>And I think that was where I, I thought improvement could be made right now. I mean the person that doesn't understand where themes reside or where plug-ins reside, they're not [00:16:00] gonna know necessarily to go under the appearance menu and look to add a theme or you know, the plug-ins menu. You know, they may find that eventually, but why not put it right out there in front of 'em so that they can easily click and say, Okay, I know what I need.</p><p>I need to get a plugin that does this. And you know, cuz we have a nice interface to actually go in and. Poor plugins and themes, but Right. It's not necessarily, um, in front of, front of your mind when you, when you first install WordPress. So I thought that was, um, something that was important to, uh, you know, to, to emphasize in this.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Sure. Yeah. And that, that seems like it, it's potentially in a good way, open for change with, uh, potential changes to the.org repository. And, and I imagine that as, um, as the.com marketplace. Um, and, you know, potentially other, other things like that. Um, If, if other hosts hosting W Commerce or, or [00:17:00] WordPress were to do something similar, um, that, that, that requires some kind of curation at some point or some, some way of featuring particular things like, this is what you need to do.</p><p>Uh, for, for example, you know, one of my pet things is can you build a, uh, sub stack like, uh, site out of WordPress very quickly. Yes, if you know how. But, um, the, there's act, those documentations kind of emerged relatively recently for doing that with a, a couple of plugins. Um, if you dig around on wordpress.com, um, and I, like Kim Coleman is, uh, for, uh, uh, paid memberships.</p><p>Pro is giving a talk right about now, I think on. On how to do that with, uh, Mail poet and their product, the Coleman's product, uh, paid membership pro. Um, that's, that's something that, um, yeah, [00:18:00] I, I agree. It's, it's tri on the, on the mass market level. It's, it's sort of the level of suggestion of here's if you want to do this, here are some ways you can do that.</p><p>And. What gets recommended there, I, I guess, is, is maybe a, a thorny issue, but as you kind of move up the up the market, um, you don't want give that much. You don't want to have an onboarding screen that says install this and this and this to, uh, you know, an agency's client. Uh, you know, you don't, they don't wanna see that either.</p><p>So, um, you want to actually be making those choices. For them. So it occurs to me that the thing that's not talked about OP openly but is talked about everywhere is that the upmarket WordPress and building even, you know, freelancers, small agencies to v i P agencies generally, um, you know, have their own ways of doing things.</p><p>[00:19:00] That do a lot of curation and like you said, building, building custom materials. But the less you do that, the less you have to support yourself. Um, that they're essentially doing, making these choices and saying, these are the things that work well for these purposes under these conditions. And I've always thought, why should that be a proprietary trade secret, especially when it's out there, but.</p><p>We're hesitant to, uh, convey that or some version of that to the, um, to the mass market. Um, what, what do you, what do you think about that? Do you think there could be some synergies there? Cause there's learning potential too, if you, if you kind of disclose, this is how we're doing it up here. Um, people who are just starting out building with WordPress are learning from leaders then.</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Yeah. Um, well, one of the things I. I, I talked about with curation was, you know, maybe managed hosts are in the best [00:20:00] position to do kind of something like that, because I think some of them already do to, to a degree. I mean, many of them are buying up, you know, plugin and themes anyway. And so, you know, maybe they're in the best position to add something like this, The WordPress, um, for someone that has the fresh install, You know, in the community it's, it's interesting because there's just so many, there's so many plugins and so many opinions that you know mm-hmm.</p><p>I may ask, well how do you build a membership site? And somebody may tell me, paid memberships, pros the way to go. Somebody may say, Member press, or, you know, there there could be five or six other, you know, really big players in that market. Um, same thing for forms and, you know, e-commerce may be a little bit less, but, um, you know, cuz we have one dominant, uh, you.</p><p>Entity there in W Commerce. But, um, you know, if you ask about w commerce extensions, you'll probably get a couple hundred different answers on that, so. Right. You know, the curation is a, a [00:21:00] bit of a tough, a tough call. Like, I, I don't, I certainly don't think, you know, the WordPress project should be, um, doing anything other than generically taking you to the, you know, Repositories and saying, this is where you can find plugins.</p><p>Now, maybe in the future they write, you know, they, they share articles or something about, well, you know, if you're going to build an e-commerce site, maybe you should consider X, Y, and Z. Not necessarily talking about. Specific plugins, but things you need to consider on your end and find to help you find the, the tool that works best for your needs and, you know, design for what your workflow is going to be.</p><p>Um, so maybe if we can add some guidance in that way without necessarily favoring one product over another. Um, but I, I, I think they're, you know, for the new user, the person who wants to just build their own basic site, Having some sort of guidance in [00:22:00] not only what plugins to use, but just how to use WordPress, I think could be, you know, extremely helpful.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yes. Uh, yeah, I, I agree with you. Um, you know, the way you, you put it here was, um, Uh, yeah, the, who would be responsible for curating is the, is the really tough issue. You'd need a, a third party of some, some kind to take that on. Um, and yeah, in the mass market where everyone's competing, um, with, with their product or service, um, that's a difficult one to do.</p><p>Who, who would be a third party? Who could, who could potentially navigate those, those waters? And are, are there things that the plugin repo could do that are sufficiently neutral with the kind of data that, that could be reported out that would, um, help that? Um, do we need something like Kevin Ohashi doing, um, you know, [00:23:00] plugin performance?</p><p>WP plugin performance reviews, like his hosting, uh, reviews.</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Yeah, that, that's interesting. You could, you, you could certainly see the repo. I mean, you know, again, you don't wanna play favorites. That's definitely, you know, gonna cause a lot of problems. Um, maybe there could be, you know, stats for, you know, different types of sites.</p><p>Um, if you are into publishing, these are the most popular plugins in that category. Because we don't, It may even be listed that way now, but we don't necessarily say that. Um, so you could look at, you know, membership sites, you could look at e-commerce, um, you know, selling digital goods, all those types of things.</p><p>Maybe we break it down by category a little more and just show what the trends are in that area. It doesn't necessarily have to favor anyone, but obviously it's going to show, you know, who's in the lead and who's not. Maybe that's [00:24:00] something to help people again and again, I, I put these out there as ideas.</p><p>They may be extremely flawed and, uh, you know, you can certainly tell me on Twitter if, if, if you don't agree. Uh, but just I think we need to find more ways to empower people to make good decisions with WordPress. Um, that's going to keep people on the platform. Throughout and they're going to hopefully have less frustration in trying to get started because I think that's, from my experience, that's the area where people are, you know, hit that wall after installing, They're like, Okay, well what do I do next?</p><p>Right.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. I wonder, I wonder if something like a, uh, plugin quality score could be developed. Which, which to some extent is being done with, with, uh, review, like combining, uh, correlating, um, support tickets and response to those and, [00:25:00] um, installs and, and things like that. But I wonder if you could, you could do a quality, um, rating that would be sufficiently neutral that people would accept.</p><p>The curation that developed from that. Say, I, I keep thinking of this one. I don't, I don't know if it's realistic, but, um, I would love to know on every plugin if I install this, what's the, what's the maximum number of queries it will add to a page load? What's the average number? And, um, that right there creates an incentive to plug in developers to get that right.</p><p>Learn, you know, if you're just starting out, uh, coding something, um, learn what that means, why it matters. Um, because that's, that seems to be one of the real, real slow downs. Um, and, and that's a pretty objective measure. Fewer queries, quicker response, um, from the server, [00:26:00] something like that. I don't know.</p><p>Do you, do you think that that sort of thing could potentially be done, um, as. Sufficiently neutral thing coming from the, From</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> I think so. I think so. I mean, one idea that just kind of popped in my head was, how about we do something activity based? Hmm. Like, just for example, um, we take into account how often a plugin updates, uh, how responsive, uh, Right.</p><p>You know, support requests are in the forms. That doesn't necessarily tell you the quality. Now I. You might be updating your plugin three or four times a week because it's broken, and you may be re responding to, you know, support requests without necessarily resolving problems. But that might be a way to, to, to help steer people away from plugins that.</p><p>Haven't been updated in years. I mean, we have that little warning on there now that, you know, when it's been, I think, what three versions. It'll tell [00:27:00] you that, hey, this hasn't been, you know, updated in, in a while, huh? But if you had maybe some sort of activity based scoring that, you know, I mean, you know, that, that puts everybody, I think on a.</p><p>Closer playing field. I don't know if it's completely level, but you know, I mean, the plugins with the most resources might, you know, be able to, to, uh, to win on some of that. But then again, if you have a, a solo entrepreneur who's got a plugin that you know, they really are passionate about and they're constantly trying to improve and they're, you know, we know there are a lot of those out there, you know, they might be able to, to compete on that.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Sure. Yeah. I, I feel, I feel like that could work if the repository made some distinction between completely free plugins and freemium model plugins, or those that have, uh, a recognized business entity behind it with. Staff and [00:28:00] like this, We exist here to support this in theory, in in perpetuity. Um, because actually there, there are some plugin if you base this on activity like TenUp.</p><p>Um, there's some, Jake Goldman still has under, under his account on, uh, on the repo that are really nice, simple, single purpose plugins and I completely trust. The support for them, for them, for the, for the most part. But, um, they're not, they're not gonna be high volume, um, uh, support activity there or updates, and they're pretty simple, yet reliable.</p><p>Um, it might be tricky to do that, but I, I think it would be fair to recognize. Leaders and high performers and recognized experts at, at some point. And, um, and the business, um, you know, the number of people who, you know, who actually exist to support [00:29:00] a particular plugin. That was when I was, when I'm doing things for clients and when I was doing that a lot more, um, you're looking at, I, I try to look at what's gonna be around for a long, long term.</p><p>You know, the, the fewer, uh, We don't wanna make changes to themes, to major plugin changes. Um, over time we want this to be really stable. So, so to me a concern would be, Hey, this is a really nice plugin, seems really well supported, but there's no business model behind it. Or it's not one that, yeah, I think will be here in five, even just five years.</p><p>Um, and the long term view. Yeah. Is another, is another criteria that's hard to, hard to suss out. Um, but those are, those are all potentially valid ways to curate, um, and indicate different, different categories of, of product that may really help people figure out what they need. Um, yeah, it's a [00:30:00] good, good question, uh, to open.</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Yeah, I think there's, there's potential for it. Um, you know, any, I think anything we can do to make it, give people more confidence that what they're installing is going to work and be, you know, stable and, you know, allow them to do. What they want to do easy in a more easy fashion. I think that would, you know, definitely be a benefit.</p><p>And just going back to the activity thing for just a second, I mean, how many plugins that are still, you know, somewhat maintained, Still say that their, their latest compatibility is like WordPress 5.8 or 5.9. Right. You know, just the simple fact of going in and, and testing with WordPress six or 6.1, maybe that gets you, you know, some brownie points in that as well.</p><p>Just that you version checked and you know, you're keeping up with that. Because I see that as another issue [00:31:00] in the repository where, There may be plugins that work perfectly well, but you're still a little hesitant because it, Yeah. You know, the compatibility hasn't been updated in two years or three years.</p><p>So that could also be, you know, a</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> factor. And it's not just compatibility to WordPress, it's, uh, you know, word WordPress, GUIs and, and compatibility for php. So plug in, plug in compatibility with, uh, which, what up to what version of PHP will it. Will it operate</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> and Yeah. Just checking. Yeah, I know. Uh, like I'm looking at a, a plugin now it says PHP version 5.4 or higher.</p><p>So there you go. Ah, right, right, right. You're in good shape, even out in a really, really old install.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yes. Right. So that raises some, some ideas. Well, that's, and that's something a DIY person isn't gonna know. They aren't, they aren't going to know. Um, you know, what version of PHP is my. Running and what does that mean and, and all that.</p><p>[00:32:00] Yeah. Support activity and development activity are, are good indicators, but then you, you can game that as well. Um, well, it creates, it creates a good incentive to do that work. But then, you know, are we adding features or minor updates just to, uh, to rank higher at that point. I don't know if it would have that, that kind of effect.</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> I mean, we've seen it with reviews, right? Yeah. People put in the phony reviews and or higher out firms to, to do that for them. So yeah, any, anything that they put in probably could be gained. I don't know if we're gonna fully prevent that, but you hope that, you know, most developers take it as a, uh, a serious matter and, you know, try to actually put in the hard work to, to rank highly and, and.</p><p>Hopefully that that's a way for them to kind of go up the charts a little bit in, in terms of how many installs they have and how many paying customers they get because of it. Right. [00:33:00]</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And there's, there's such a categorical difference between people who are running their business that way. And well, it's a good, it's a good way to game things towards more support, more development, and, uh, taking an active interest in, in what's going on with your, your product.</p><p>And in the way it's, uh, presented to people who are going to install it. Um, and it's. Good idea. I, I do feel that those things go together. Any, anything that improves or changes in, in core to change the onboarding experience to, um, make it easier with respect to what you install, has gotta be corresponding somehow to, um, what you see on the on.org, um, what it's putting out publicly as a, as a signal for, um, for quality.</p><p>The last thing. Well close to where you, you closed was, was talking about outreach, um, that we should just show what, what WordPress can do. [00:34:00] Um, and do you think we just don't do that enough or it's not unified enough? Or just in the Gutenberg era, we're just beginning to see tutorials and guides, um, show up, especially for non-technical users.</p><p>And, um, that's, that's something. on.org, Learn, Learn. Um, wordpress.org is, uh, busy trying to do, there's a ton of meetups coming out that are really geared towards this sort of thing. Um, and, and also people who are building at sites at a more advanced level. Um, do you see that as something that's just starting to happen or something altogether different that you had in mind?</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> I, I sort of see this as kind of like a, a. Coming of WordPress, right? Because when a lot of us, you know, who have been in this a while started, you know, if you went to a Word camp, you probably learned an awful lot about the basics of WordPress. Whether you were just [00:35:00] using it as, you know, a content creator, or you were a developer.</p><p>And I think we've kind of lost that along the way a little bit. We've kind of focused so much on the more advanced topics. And then of course, the pandemic, you know, took away a, a lot of the in person events. So I, I think, you know, the word camps are one way to really start showing, you know, new users what's possible and you know, how to, to do the basics.</p><p>Um, you know, I, I would, I honestly, I would love to see that at Word Camp us or one of the really. International events, you know, have a track just for new people, uh, you know, where they can ask experts questions, you know, that people that, you know, we, we see in the post status slack or we see on online all the time.</p><p>You know, if, if a new user's able to ask them questions that, you know, that can go a long way towards selling them on the platform and keeping them there. Um, and you mentioned the learn [00:36:00] tool. Well, I, I think that's fantastic. That's actually something I brought up on the, uh, on the slack the other day. You know, Has there been any effort to kind of integrate that with the core software so that you can easily find tutorials?</p><p>Uh, maybe through a plugin or, or something like that? Because we have various WordPress support, uh, tools that are third party, you know, that'll show videos on how to do different things. We have this wonderful resource and if somebody doesn't visit wordpress.org, they're really not gonna know it's. And I think, you know, it's such an opportunity to reach people and, and teach them how to do anything from the basics to, you know, once they level up to, you know, some more advanced things, it's all right there waiting and, you know, all we have to do in some way, some respects is, you know, put it in front of them, You know, give them the opportunity to see it.</p><p>Um, so those are things, you know. The WordPress community has so much great content, so many smart people. I think we [00:37:00] ought to be able to put our heads together and, and find ways to, you know, encourage new users and embrace them and, and, and, you know, kind of help them, you know, with any stumbling blocks.</p><p>And because, you know, if once we kind of. Hate to say the phrase die out. You know, what, what, what is the next generation of WordPress user going to look like? How, how are they going to use the software? You know, if we want to keep it as a market leader, we want to keep it, uh, viable, you know, the new users are, you know, just critical</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> to that, right?</p><p>Yeah. I, I think that Learn is, uh, learn. WordPress is. Logical, the content that's being developed there and also the meetups that are going on, the, um, kind of webinars that are, that are happening are, um, are logical to move into the dashboard for certain, um, certain use [00:38:00] cases, um, in the, in mass market, DIY users.</p><p>All right, well, It's been good talking to you again. I, I think this, this is a good, a good topic with a lot of questions in it that touch a couple of the main, main conversations and, and issues today that we've, we've been all, all thinking about, um, what to do with, uh, potential changes to the plugin repository and, and the kind of data that that comes out of there.</p><p>Dot org content and information can somehow fit into the, um, into the WordPress dashboard and, um, interface there to help people and connect them with the community. Um, how we could maybe standardize, uh, the experience and some interface design, how things are, are done on the back end that, um, makes [00:39:00] it a more palatable and, uh, Less busy interruptive, um, or confused experience on, on sites with a lot of things installed, whether it's, um, someone just setting up their own, their own site, or, uh, an agency doing it for a, a high end client.</p><p>Um, I think the more, the more we see those all as, uh, common problems everyone has. The better chance at br at bringing everyone towards a, an aligned solution where everyone wins. Um, ideally one, one would hope .</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> There's potential there. Absolutely. Hope so. Um, you know, The, the, you know, if you start the conversation, hopefully, um, you know, you bring in some good ideas and if we see a few of them implemented, uh, that's like you said, that's gonna benefit everybody.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> You have been listening to post status excerpt, a podcast from post Status, the [00:40:00] community for WordPress professionals.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Can We Get to ‚ÄúYes‚Äù on Better UX?</h2><p>What does WordPress need to do to appeal more to do-it-yourself website builders and creators who are trying to take a business, hobby, or side project online? This week in an article he shared in <a href="https://poststatus.com/#choose-membership"><strong>Post Status Slack</strong></a>, <strong>Eric Karkovack</strong> suggested <a href="https://speckyboy.com/can-wordpress-appeal-to-diy-markets/">some ways to improve the WordPress user experience</a>, especially for DIY users setting up a website for the first time.</p><p>We also have lists of plugins we disrecommend ‚Äî to the point that it's a dealbreaker if a client insists on using them. And of course, these lists change a lot over time.¬†</p><blockquote><p>We all know these things ‚Äî but it's a kind of ‚Äúopen secret‚Äù within professional WordPress circles. That's understandable! Comparison is the thief of joy ‚Äî and possibly revenue.</p></blockquote><p>Some of the things Eric wants to see happen, like a standard interface for plugins and a curated view of the plugin ecosystem, are similar to views commonly expressed by designers, developers, and people in other professional roles at WordPress agencies serving enterprise clients. And why not? In the WordPress enterprise space, are the end users really that much different than mass-market WordPress users in what they <i>don't</i> need to know or see ‚Äî and what they do need to perform routine content creation and management tasks as easily as possible?¬†</p><p>That's where my thinking has been lately, so I had a conversation with Eric to see if we might identify areas where nearly everyone thinks WordPress offers a poor experience and how they might align themselves toward solutions. Can we get everyone to ‚Äúyes‚Äù on a better UX?</p><h2>Don't Play Favorites ‚Äî Recognize Excellence</h2><p>Standardizing admin interfaces and notifications might be easier than figuring out how to curate best-of-breed themes and plugins. But imagine, as Eric and I do in this conversation, some kind of ‚Äúplugin quality score‚Äù at wordpress.org based on neutral, objective data. It might be ‚Äúgamed‚Äù ‚Äî in a positive way. It would encourage developers to do better, deeper, ever-maturing work.</p><p>Personally, I'd like to see the maximum and the average number of queries a plugin adds to a page. That, along with PHP and WordPress versions that have been tested for compatibility (existing features of the plugin repository) would be key code quality indicators. Frequency of updates, reviews, and support responses would indicate a capacity for long-term sustainability. Raising <a href="https://poststatus.com/we-dont-need-no-stinkin-standards/">standards for testing aimed mainly at security</a> would be great too. All of this could be done or encouraged by key players in the WordPress ecosystem coming together to set standards for their industry. It would impact how all users of the plugin directory understand quality.</p><h2>Don't Hide it from the Noobs: Too Many Open Secrets About Quality are Bad for Everyone</h2><p>As of today, there are 60,153 un-curated free plugins at wordpress.org that can only be explored via external search and a limited (<a href="https://poststatus.com/a-visit-from-the-good-idea-fairy/">arguably broken</a>) site search tool. WordPress professionals with high-end client services would never expose their customers to this chaos ‚Äî so why does the WordPress community expose its newcomers to it? Anyone who has developed WordPress sites for very long has a list of plugins they prefer, particularly in combination with each other, for common feature sets and use cases. We also have lists of plugins we dis-recommend ‚Äî to the point that it's a deal breaker if a client insists on using them. And of course, these lists change a lot over time.¬†</p><p>We all know these things ‚Äî but it's a kind of ‚Äúopen secret‚Äù from professional WordPress circles. That's understandable! Comparison is the thief of joy ‚Äî and possibly revenue. But we need to be more open and better at communicating these things in a problem-solving, always-learning way within appropriate channels. Open source security is a different issue, but <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards">performance and code quality standards</a> ‚Äî and the products/people who follow them in exemplary ways ‚Äî should be much more visible and celebrated.</p><p>(What if someone did a tutorial series walking through current WordPress code standards and the <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-coding-standards-has-reached-a/">history</a> of <a href="https://poststatus.com/accessibility-draft-standards-are-ready-for-review/">their</a> <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-coding-standards-1-2-1-has-been/">evolution</a>?)</p><p>Information that maturing developers and product owners can learn from to improve their work doesn't trickle down as openly or as easily as it should. It's inside baseball, and it shouldn't be quite so insider-y. It's not out there alongside independent <a href="https://poststatus.com/kevin-ohashi-deep-history-and-integrity-in-hosting-benchmarks/">plugin performance reviews</a> or clear standards and guidance for anyone who wants them.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>What are the barriers?</p><p>Who can lift them?</p><p>Industry peers and WordPress community members working together on common interests?</p><p>As we end up saying in our conversation, we hope so.</p><img src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gdpro800x500-1-300x188.png" alt="GoDaddy Pro" /><h3>‚ú® Sponsor: <a href="https://poststat.us/godaddypro">GoDaddy Pro</a></h3><p>Manage your clients, websites, and tasks from a single dashboard with <strong>GoDaddy Pro</strong>.

What can WordPress do to appeal to the do it yourself market? , what brought that topic up for you this week, Eric?</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> I think it's a combination of things. For one, you know, we have full site editing that's been around for a little bit now, and, you know, we're not seeing like huge adoption rates with it.</p><p>We're getting people to, um, you know, kind of learn what's involved with that and block themes and, um, [00:02:00] and also at the same time we're, you know, the, the changes that we've seen, The block editor over time and you know, even the, kind of, the genesis of that project I think was to kind of compete with, um, more.</p><p>Content management systems, kind of like, you know, WS or Squarespace and what have you. Um, and it seems like WordPress is just going toward that market more and more as they, as they build on. And so I thought those were really nice steps in that direction, right? So we have tools that. Make it a little bit easier for someone who maybe isn't, uh, familiar with code to go in and and build a, a site.</p><p>But that led me to think about, well, what else should we be doing in that area? What else could WordPress do to make it. Uh, as foolproof as possible, um, to build a basic site, not something necessarily like, um, you know, a complex, you know, high end enterprise site, [00:03:00] but just something basic that someone can do within a couple of hours.</p><p>So that really kind of where that, the post came from.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Have you seen the, uh, videos where Jamie Marsland and, uh, who else did this had, had their daughters or, Um, I think of very different ages too, but it tried to do exactly that. And, um, he had, he had his kids do, um, um, Elementor versus Gutenberg, I think it was.</p><p>Yeah. Yeah. And that was, that was interesting. I mean, you really have to. That totally someone totally different from you, um, using it for the first time and Yeah, I think, I think a lot of, um, thought has gone into that user experience is, is huge. Uh, now, of course, always, always should have been, but um, Gutenberg is, is very squarely focused on the, on the user experience, building out your, your site and, and [00:04:00] pages.</p><p>And, um, my, my thought though was everyone wants that. Um, it's not just the mass market, the lower and middle end, um, of that, but, um, agencies to up. The, uh, those that are serving enterprise, enterprise clients, uh, WordPress, v i p partners, um, I hear, I hear the same things from them, like, you know, even very recent conversations, um, about.</p><p>How having standard interface that doesn't throw you different, totally different screens when you use, uh, a plugin in the back end. Um, that's a, a con basic design principle of there's much less cognitive load on you when the navigation is standard. Even if you've never used WordPress before, um, [00:05:00] you.</p><p>You're f it seems familiar because things are intuitively laid out. Cause it's, it's like a lot of other things. WordPress is, is old enough and in so influential that it's, it's, uh, backend interface has been copied in a lot of ways. It's very, very familiar. Um, interestingly, even if people haven't used it.</p><p>Um, so when you hit a plugin with, you know, crazy level of setting screens or its own interface design, um, that's not, that doesn't. Look good with, uh, with anyone really, but with a enterprise client. I, I think that's an issue. That's one of the things you talk about in here. Um, Yeah, we have you thought about that at all?</p><p>Um, how, Yeah. Pretty much every market, every WordPress market, uh, could benefit from.</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> It's, it's funny you mentioned that cuz I really wasn't thinking of like the enterprise clients. And I [00:06:00] think the reason for that is because usually if I have a client who's a little more higher end on the, on the price scale, I'm usually building things to kind of account for all of that right?</p><p>Where I can, I mean, obviously I can't change a in ui, but I can certainly do things with custom fields or blocks or what have you to try and make the, the content creation and editing process. Simple as possible for them. So by, by doing some of these things at core level, you would take away the need to build all that extra stuff on top to, you know, to make it easier for the corporate client to use.</p><p>So I think it, it, it goes together pretty well. Um, The one example in terms of UI that I have in the article is, uh, you know, just looking at the standard WordPress settings page. We have the reading settings, and then next to it I have, uh, the opening screen of slider Revolution, which is, uh, plugin bundled with [00:07:00] a bunch of different schemes and, uh, like a theme forest, what have you.</p><p>Um, it's like a completely different thing. And to, to that end, even Elementor is as well, I mean the, a lot of. Popular page builder plugins basically take over, uh, the UI and it's like you're in a completely different planet. And think about if you're a brand new user and you've got just Elementor or Slider Revolution on your site, you bought this theme and it comes with these things, you're kind of thinking you're dropped into a middle of Mars or something.</p><p>You're not sure what, you know how to get back to where you were and what the difference is between. You know, that UI based versus, you know, the, the core WordPress ui. Uh, in a lot of ways that doesn't make sense. So I think that's something we have to try and unify. Um, I don't know how we go about doing that at the core level.</p><p>Um, but I, I think if we make core as clean as possible, maybe that's at [00:08:00] least a good start.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, there were, there would have to be, um, some, some standards in reusable. Patterns and, and tools. Um, I, I think that in the long run, the, uh, Gutenberg is, is supposed to eat the entire, you know, it's, it's a true ship of Tesus project where the entire thing gets rebuilt while moving.</p><p>Um, And in, in some way it will be a, the goal is, is to have a unified experience at the end of that, just how quickly that happens depends on, on core contribution. Um, on the velocity of that, um, Yeah, that's for lack of that. I, I think it's, um, it's a bad experience for everyone and Sure. Uh, uh, an enterprise client is really just at bottom end users, uh, employees who have as much experience maybe as the average DIY site builder, a [00:09:00] creator, someone who wants to start a podcast or, or sell a product, um, as a side project or something like that.</p><p>There's, there's really no difference there. Everyone, um, has the same, uh, usability needs in general, and more or less, there's, there's big differences when you, you started talking about compliance needs with accessibility and, and so on and, and things like that. But, um, yeah, it seems like to me that there, there's a lot of opportunity for aligning, um, different parts of, of the word.</p><p>Community and business community where. Plug in. Developers and owners should really want this. The same thing that, uh, agency people, um, do. And that's, they, they support each other. Um, they feed each other business. So I, I'm curious why. That hasn't [00:10:00] happened, and it seems to me like there's some information flows or I don't know.</p><p>There there are probably other, other sticky barriers. Have you, did you, did that question come up for you at all? Why? Um, why?</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Well, I know it's like, it's something we've talked about a little bit, right? I mean, yeah, just on, on a few different levels and with the, uh, you know, Active install data going away from wordpress.org, and maybe these folks need to band together a little more and, and share amongst each other.</p><p>I, I think the reason it hasn't happened yet is because it really hasn't had to, um, you know, maybe they haven't seen necessarily the benefit of it, but when you see kind of the, the yeah. Jumble of the, the UI right now and how it, how different it can be depending on what you have installed. You know, maybe there is something that, you know, some of these larger plugin developers could work together on.</p><p>Sure. Uh, it makes sense. You know, it makes sense for all of them. I mean, [00:11:00] I, I, I somehow see us heading towards some sort of consortium of, of, uh, folks who, who can't necessarily write strict standards, but maybe they have certain. You know, broad outlines of, of what they, they want to, to abide by. And, you know, the more people that do that, the better I think it is for WordPress users and for just really everyone involved, because the software's going to be easier to use and more uniform.</p><p>Right.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. There's, there's a lot that the, um, that, that part of the community could do for itself. I've, uh, Tried to be more vocal about, but I, I think there, there have been a few, few voices behind those ideas of you, Hey, you, there's a lot you can do, um, to shape your own industry. Um, Yeah, if you do have a shared, a shared interface framework and, um, formal or informal standards for [00:12:00] Yeah, we were talking about.</p><p>Admin notifications previously. Um, that's part of it. Um, it, it'd save you a lot of time if there was a base to build on. Um, more than, more than I think exists now. Um, so that, uh, anyone starting, starting out creating a, a new plugin, um, would have some kind of, uh, head start. Really a standard interface or, or guidance at least.</p><p>I don't know that there's that much, um, public information. And, uh, it's curious to me as, as, uh, as things like the W Commerce, um, partnership program kind of is a bit, looks like, a bit like a, getting into, uh, a relationship with WordPress, v i p. Um, there's criteria to go through, uh, that you have, well you have to meet, um, to become, um, a preferred agency working.</p><p>Um, with w commerce.com side with [00:13:00] automatic, um, what those criteria are and what the standards are, should I think, have some kind of trickle down effect, like know what they are and, um, and have them as at least aspirational for everyone. Um, there's been some talk in, in, uh, core of, um, bringing. Some changes on, uh, on standards and testing for, uh, coding, um, coding standards for security.</p><p>Uh, I think primarily performance and security. Um, and I hope those continue to get prioritized that that's what all seems, seems to need to happen to, um, to move this forward. But the one point you mentioned, um, where you're talking about modernizing the onboarding experience, Where you direct people to, where to find themes, where to find plugins that, uh, [00:14:00] that becomes challenging and touches, touches.</p><p>This other recent issue we've talked about, um, it is hard to search in the, in the plugin repository is not in an ideal state and people who are trying to sell. Their plugins there, um, have a number of frustrations with, with trying to surface their, their products as relevant to what people are searching for.</p><p>Um, do you think this could be part of a solution to that if, or a potential conflict point when you're curating, you're, you're curating and recommending, um, certain ones?</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Well, I think as far as, as core goes, um, my idea is more. Just pointing people to the repositories. Mm-hmm. , uh, for themes and plugins, not necessarily being a, uh, a [00:15:00] curator, but, um, I, I, I see the, you know, I see there, there, there should be more impetus to improve the, the repositories and make them easier for folks to search and figure out what it is they're getting and what, you know, um, allow new entries to be a little more, uh, visible.</p><p>But I think they're kind of separate things, you know, just to be able to, I mean, if, if you're installing WordPress now from the, you know, from, from your host, or if you're, you know, FTPing it up to your site, old school style, um, you know, you're, you're gonna get this little. Widget did on the, on the front screen of the dashboard that welcomes you to WordPress and gives you a few handy links, but it doesn't really tell you about how to actually use what you're, you've got.</p><p>And I think that was where I, I thought improvement could be made right now. I mean the person that doesn't understand where themes reside or where plug-ins reside, they're not [00:16:00] gonna know necessarily to go under the appearance menu and look to add a theme or you know, the plug-ins menu. You know, they may find that eventually, but why not put it right out there in front of 'em so that they can easily click and say, Okay, I know what I need.</p><p>I need to get a plugin that does this. And you know, cuz we have a nice interface to actually go in and. Poor plugins and themes, but Right. It's not necessarily, um, in front of, front of your mind when you, when you first install WordPress. So I thought that was, um, something that was important to, uh, you know, to, to emphasize in this.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Sure. Yeah. And that, that seems like it, it's potentially in a good way, open for change with, uh, potential changes to the.org repository. And, and I imagine that as, um, as the.com marketplace. Um, and, you know, potentially other, other things like that. Um, If, if other hosts hosting W Commerce or, or [00:17:00] WordPress were to do something similar, um, that, that, that requires some kind of curation at some point or some, some way of featuring particular things like, this is what you need to do.</p><p>Uh, for, for example, you know, one of my pet things is can you build a, uh, sub stack like, uh, site out of WordPress very quickly. Yes, if you know how. But, um, the, there's act, those documentations kind of emerged relatively recently for doing that with a, a couple of plugins. Um, if you dig around on wordpress.com, um, and I, like Kim Coleman is, uh, for, uh, uh, paid memberships.</p><p>Pro is giving a talk right about now, I think on. On how to do that with, uh, Mail poet and their product, the Coleman's product, uh, paid membership pro. Um, that's, that's something that, um, yeah, [00:18:00] I, I agree. It's, it's tri on the, on the mass market level. It's, it's sort of the level of suggestion of here's if you want to do this, here are some ways you can do that.</p><p>And. What gets recommended there, I, I guess, is, is maybe a, a thorny issue, but as you kind of move up the up the market, um, you don't want give that much. You don't want to have an onboarding screen that says install this and this and this to, uh, you know, an agency's client. Uh, you know, you don't, they don't wanna see that either.</p><p>So, um, you want to actually be making those choices. For them. So it occurs to me that the thing that's not talked about OP openly but is talked about everywhere is that the upmarket WordPress and building even, you know, freelancers, small agencies to v i P agencies generally, um, you know, have their own ways of doing things.</p><p>[00:19:00] That do a lot of curation and like you said, building, building custom materials. But the less you do that, the less you have to support yourself. Um, that they're essentially doing, making these choices and saying, these are the things that work well for these purposes under these conditions. And I've always thought, why should that be a proprietary trade secret, especially when it's out there, but.</p><p>We're hesitant to, uh, convey that or some version of that to the, um, to the mass market. Um, what, what do you, what do you think about that? Do you think there could be some synergies there? Cause there's learning potential too, if you, if you kind of disclose, this is how we're doing it up here. Um, people who are just starting out building with WordPress are learning from leaders then.</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Yeah. Um, well, one of the things I. I, I talked about with curation was, you know, maybe managed hosts are in the best [00:20:00] position to do kind of something like that, because I think some of them already do to, to a degree. I mean, many of them are buying up, you know, plugin and themes anyway. And so, you know, maybe they're in the best position to add something like this, The WordPress, um, for someone that has the fresh install, You know, in the community it's, it's interesting because there's just so many, there's so many plugins and so many opinions that you know mm-hmm.</p><p>I may ask, well how do you build a membership site? And somebody may tell me, paid memberships, pros the way to go. Somebody may say, Member press, or, you know, there there could be five or six other, you know, really big players in that market. Um, same thing for forms and, you know, e-commerce may be a little bit less, but, um, you know, cuz we have one dominant, uh, you.</p><p>Entity there in W Commerce. But, um, you know, if you ask about w commerce extensions, you'll probably get a couple hundred different answers on that, so. Right. You know, the curation is a, a [00:21:00] bit of a tough, a tough call. Like, I, I don't, I certainly don't think, you know, the WordPress project should be, um, doing anything other than generically taking you to the, you know, Repositories and saying, this is where you can find plugins.</p><p>Now, maybe in the future they write, you know, they, they share articles or something about, well, you know, if you're going to build an e-commerce site, maybe you should consider X, Y, and Z. Not necessarily talking about. Specific plugins, but things you need to consider on your end and find to help you find the, the tool that works best for your needs and, you know, design for what your workflow is going to be.</p><p>Um, so maybe if we can add some guidance in that way without necessarily favoring one product over another. Um, but I, I, I think they're, you know, for the new user, the person who wants to just build their own basic site, Having some sort of guidance in [00:22:00] not only what plugins to use, but just how to use WordPress, I think could be, you know, extremely helpful.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yes. Uh, yeah, I, I agree with you. Um, you know, the way you, you put it here was, um, Uh, yeah, the, who would be responsible for curating is the, is the really tough issue. You'd need a, a third party of some, some kind to take that on. Um, and yeah, in the mass market where everyone's competing, um, with, with their product or service, um, that's a difficult one to do.</p><p>Who, who would be a third party? Who could, who could potentially navigate those, those waters? And are, are there things that the plugin repo could do that are sufficiently neutral with the kind of data that, that could be reported out that would, um, help that? Um, do we need something like Kevin Ohashi doing, um, you know, [00:23:00] plugin performance?</p><p>WP plugin performance reviews, like his hosting, uh, reviews.</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Yeah, that, that's interesting. You could, you, you could certainly see the repo. I mean, you know, again, you don't wanna play favorites. That's definitely, you know, gonna cause a lot of problems. Um, maybe there could be, you know, stats for, you know, different types of sites.</p><p>Um, if you are into publishing, these are the most popular plugins in that category. Because we don't, It may even be listed that way now, but we don't necessarily say that. Um, so you could look at, you know, membership sites, you could look at e-commerce, um, you know, selling digital goods, all those types of things.</p><p>Maybe we break it down by category a little more and just show what the trends are in that area. It doesn't necessarily have to favor anyone, but obviously it's going to show, you know, who's in the lead and who's not. Maybe that's [00:24:00] something to help people again and again, I, I put these out there as ideas.</p><p>They may be extremely flawed and, uh, you know, you can certainly tell me on Twitter if, if, if you don't agree. Uh, but just I think we need to find more ways to empower people to make good decisions with WordPress. Um, that's going to keep people on the platform. Throughout and they're going to hopefully have less frustration in trying to get started because I think that's, from my experience, that's the area where people are, you know, hit that wall after installing, They're like, Okay, well what do I do next?</p><p>Right.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. I wonder, I wonder if something like a, uh, plugin quality score could be developed. Which, which to some extent is being done with, with, uh, review, like combining, uh, correlating, um, support tickets and response to those and, [00:25:00] um, installs and, and things like that. But I wonder if you could, you could do a quality, um, rating that would be sufficiently neutral that people would accept.</p><p>The curation that developed from that. Say, I, I keep thinking of this one. I don't, I don't know if it's realistic, but, um, I would love to know on every plugin if I install this, what's the, what's the maximum number of queries it will add to a page load? What's the average number? And, um, that right there creates an incentive to plug in developers to get that right.</p><p>Learn, you know, if you're just starting out, uh, coding something, um, learn what that means, why it matters. Um, because that's, that seems to be one of the real, real slow downs. Um, and, and that's a pretty objective measure. Fewer queries, quicker response, um, from the server, [00:26:00] something like that. I don't know.</p><p>Do you, do you think that that sort of thing could potentially be done, um, as. Sufficiently neutral thing coming from the, From</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> I think so. I think so. I mean, one idea that just kind of popped in my head was, how about we do something activity based? Hmm. Like, just for example, um, we take into account how often a plugin updates, uh, how responsive, uh, Right.</p><p>You know, support requests are in the forms. That doesn't necessarily tell you the quality. Now I. You might be updating your plugin three or four times a week because it's broken, and you may be re responding to, you know, support requests without necessarily resolving problems. But that might be a way to, to, to help steer people away from plugins that.</p><p>Haven't been updated in years. I mean, we have that little warning on there now that, you know, when it's been, I think, what three versions. It'll tell [00:27:00] you that, hey, this hasn't been, you know, updated in, in a while, huh? But if you had maybe some sort of activity based scoring that, you know, I mean, you know, that, that puts everybody, I think on a.</p><p>Closer playing field. I don't know if it's completely level, but you know, I mean, the plugins with the most resources might, you know, be able to, to, uh, to win on some of that. But then again, if you have a, a solo entrepreneur who's got a plugin that you know, they really are passionate about and they're constantly trying to improve and they're, you know, we know there are a lot of those out there, you know, they might be able to, to compete on that.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Sure. Yeah. I, I feel, I feel like that could work if the repository made some distinction between completely free plugins and freemium model plugins, or those that have, uh, a recognized business entity behind it with. Staff and [00:28:00] like this, We exist here to support this in theory, in in perpetuity. Um, because actually there, there are some plugin if you base this on activity like TenUp.</p><p>Um, there's some, Jake Goldman still has under, under his account on, uh, on the repo that are really nice, simple, single purpose plugins and I completely trust. The support for them, for them, for the, for the most part. But, um, they're not, they're not gonna be high volume, um, uh, support activity there or updates, and they're pretty simple, yet reliable.</p><p>Um, it might be tricky to do that, but I, I think it would be fair to recognize. Leaders and high performers and recognized experts at, at some point. And, um, and the business, um, you know, the number of people who, you know, who actually exist to support [00:29:00] a particular plugin. That was when I was, when I'm doing things for clients and when I was doing that a lot more, um, you're looking at, I, I try to look at what's gonna be around for a long, long term.</p><p>You know, the, the fewer, uh, We don't wanna make changes to themes, to major plugin changes. Um, over time we want this to be really stable. So, so to me a concern would be, Hey, this is a really nice plugin, seems really well supported, but there's no business model behind it. Or it's not one that, yeah, I think will be here in five, even just five years.</p><p>Um, and the long term view. Yeah. Is another, is another criteria that's hard to, hard to suss out. Um, but those are, those are all potentially valid ways to curate, um, and indicate different, different categories of, of product that may really help people figure out what they need. Um, yeah, it's a [00:30:00] good, good question, uh, to open.</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Yeah, I think there's, there's potential for it. Um, you know, any, I think anything we can do to make it, give people more confidence that what they're installing is going to work and be, you know, stable and, you know, allow them to do. What they want to do easy in a more easy fashion. I think that would, you know, definitely be a benefit.</p><p>And just going back to the activity thing for just a second, I mean, how many plugins that are still, you know, somewhat maintained, Still say that their, their latest compatibility is like WordPress 5.8 or 5.9. Right. You know, just the simple fact of going in and, and testing with WordPress six or 6.1, maybe that gets you, you know, some brownie points in that as well.</p><p>Just that you version checked and you know, you're keeping up with that. Because I see that as another issue [00:31:00] in the repository where, There may be plugins that work perfectly well, but you're still a little hesitant because it, Yeah. You know, the compatibility hasn't been updated in two years or three years.</p><p>So that could also be, you know, a</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> factor. And it's not just compatibility to WordPress, it's, uh, you know, word WordPress, GUIs and, and compatibility for php. So plug in, plug in compatibility with, uh, which, what up to what version of PHP will it. Will it operate</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> and Yeah. Just checking. Yeah, I know. Uh, like I'm looking at a, a plugin now it says PHP version 5.4 or higher.</p><p>So there you go. Ah, right, right, right. You're in good shape, even out in a really, really old install.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yes. Right. So that raises some, some ideas. Well, that's, and that's something a DIY person isn't gonna know. They aren't, they aren't going to know. Um, you know, what version of PHP is my. Running and what does that mean and, and all that.</p><p>[00:32:00] Yeah. Support activity and development activity are, are good indicators, but then you, you can game that as well. Um, well, it creates, it creates a good incentive to do that work. But then, you know, are we adding features or minor updates just to, uh, to rank higher at that point. I don't know if it would have that, that kind of effect.</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> I mean, we've seen it with reviews, right? Yeah. People put in the phony reviews and or higher out firms to, to do that for them. So yeah, any, anything that they put in probably could be gained. I don't know if we're gonna fully prevent that, but you hope that, you know, most developers take it as a, uh, a serious matter and, you know, try to actually put in the hard work to, to rank highly and, and.</p><p>Hopefully that that's a way for them to kind of go up the charts a little bit in, in terms of how many installs they have and how many paying customers they get because of it. Right. [00:33:00]</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And there's, there's such a categorical difference between people who are running their business that way. And well, it's a good, it's a good way to game things towards more support, more development, and, uh, taking an active interest in, in what's going on with your, your product.</p><p>And in the way it's, uh, presented to people who are going to install it. Um, and it's. Good idea. I, I do feel that those things go together. Any, anything that improves or changes in, in core to change the onboarding experience to, um, make it easier with respect to what you install, has gotta be corresponding somehow to, um, what you see on the on.org, um, what it's putting out publicly as a, as a signal for, um, for quality.</p><p>The last thing. Well close to where you, you closed was, was talking about outreach, um, that we should just show what, what WordPress can do. [00:34:00] Um, and do you think we just don't do that enough or it's not unified enough? Or just in the Gutenberg era, we're just beginning to see tutorials and guides, um, show up, especially for non-technical users.</p><p>And, um, that's, that's something. on.org, Learn, Learn. Um, wordpress.org is, uh, busy trying to do, there's a ton of meetups coming out that are really geared towards this sort of thing. Um, and, and also people who are building at sites at a more advanced level. Um, do you see that as something that's just starting to happen or something altogether different that you had in mind?</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> I, I sort of see this as kind of like a, a. Coming of WordPress, right? Because when a lot of us, you know, who have been in this a while started, you know, if you went to a Word camp, you probably learned an awful lot about the basics of WordPress. Whether you were just [00:35:00] using it as, you know, a content creator, or you were a developer.</p><p>And I think we've kind of lost that along the way a little bit. We've kind of focused so much on the more advanced topics. And then of course, the pandemic, you know, took away a, a lot of the in person events. So I, I think, you know, the word camps are one way to really start showing, you know, new users what's possible and you know, how to, to do the basics.</p><p>Um, you know, I, I would, I honestly, I would love to see that at Word Camp us or one of the really. International events, you know, have a track just for new people, uh, you know, where they can ask experts questions, you know, that people that, you know, we, we see in the post status slack or we see on online all the time.</p><p>You know, if, if a new user's able to ask them questions that, you know, that can go a long way towards selling them on the platform and keeping them there. Um, and you mentioned the learn [00:36:00] tool. Well, I, I think that's fantastic. That's actually something I brought up on the, uh, on the slack the other day. You know, Has there been any effort to kind of integrate that with the core software so that you can easily find tutorials?</p><p>Uh, maybe through a plugin or, or something like that? Because we have various WordPress support, uh, tools that are third party, you know, that'll show videos on how to do different things. We have this wonderful resource and if somebody doesn't visit wordpress.org, they're really not gonna know it's. And I think, you know, it's such an opportunity to reach people and, and teach them how to do anything from the basics to, you know, once they level up to, you know, some more advanced things, it's all right there waiting and, you know, all we have to do in some way, some respects is, you know, put it in front of them, You know, give them the opportunity to see it.</p><p>Um, so those are things, you know. The WordPress community has so much great content, so many smart people. I think we [00:37:00] ought to be able to put our heads together and, and find ways to, you know, encourage new users and embrace them and, and, and, you know, kind of help them, you know, with any stumbling blocks.</p><p>And because, you know, if once we kind of. Hate to say the phrase die out. You know, what, what, what is the next generation of WordPress user going to look like? How, how are they going to use the software? You know, if we want to keep it as a market leader, we want to keep it, uh, viable, you know, the new users are, you know, just critical</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> to that, right?</p><p>Yeah. I, I think that Learn is, uh, learn. WordPress is. Logical, the content that's being developed there and also the meetups that are going on, the, um, kind of webinars that are, that are happening are, um, are logical to move into the dashboard for certain, um, certain use [00:38:00] cases, um, in the, in mass market, DIY users.</p><p>All right, well, It's been good talking to you again. I, I think this, this is a good, a good topic with a lot of questions in it that touch a couple of the main, main conversations and, and issues today that we've, we've been all, all thinking about, um, what to do with, uh, potential changes to the plugin repository and, and the kind of data that that comes out of there.</p><p>Dot org content and information can somehow fit into the, um, into the WordPress dashboard and, um, interface there to help people and connect them with the community. Um, how we could maybe standardize, uh, the experience and some interface design, how things are, are done on the back end that, um, makes [00:39:00] it a more palatable and, uh, Less busy interruptive, um, or confused experience on, on sites with a lot of things installed, whether it's, um, someone just setting up their own, their own site, or, uh, an agency doing it for a, a high end client.</p><p>Um, I think the more, the more we see those all as, uh, common problems everyone has. The better chance at br at bringing everyone towards a, an aligned solution where everyone wins. Um, ideally one, one would hope .</p><p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> There's potential there. Absolutely. Hope so. Um, you know, The, the, you know, if you start the conversation, hopefully, um, you know, you bring in some good ideas and if we see a few of them implemented, uh, that's like you said, that's gonna benefit everybody.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> You have been listening to post status excerpt, a podcast from post Status, the [00:40:00] community for WordPress professionals.

      <title>Post Status Excerpt (No. 71) ‚Äî Building, Supporting, and Selling a Winning Product ‚Äî With or Without¬†WordPress.org</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week I sat down again with <strong>Eric Karkovack</strong> to talk about the three top WordPress stories on the top of our minds. Independently, we made nearly the same selections! It seems the temporary loss of active install stats at WP.org has created an opportunity to rethink long-held assumptions and find new ways forward. Our news picks are all related to this in one way or another. So there's a single throughline in this episode ‚Äî what works, what doesn't, and what will take WordPress businesses forward in the product, agency, and hosting spaces.</p><h3>Are Active Install Counts Irrelevant to Your Plugin Business's Success? (Even if they were accurate?)</h3><blockquote><p>There are always going to be developers who push the envelope when it comes to littering the dashboard and just making it a difficult user experience. Maybe data is part of the way we solve that.</p><p><strong>Eric Karkovac</strong></p></blockquote><p>First up is <strong>Alex Denning</strong>'s article at <strong>Ellipsis</strong>, "<a href="https://getellipsis.com/blog/org-is-ineffective-plugin-distribution/">WordPress.org¬†is ineffective for plugin distribution in 2022</a>." Alex argues the likely temporary loss of Active Install Growth data for plugin owners is not a bottom-line, business-relevant concern. Apart from the revelation that that data itself was not just obfuscated and inexact but "<a href="https://wptavern.com/discussion-on-replacing-plugin-active-install-growth-data-continues-behind-closed-doors">basically garbage</a>," Alex draws on Ellipsis' marketing experience and extensive data (as well as <strong>Iain Poulson</strong>'s <a href="https://s.wptrends.co/w/kWJrSn4PAY2Xziux1YiYEQ">insights</a> at <strong>WP Trends</strong>) to show 1-2% conversion rates are the norm for plugins in the¬†WP.org repository. Only a couple of big players can crack the 100k+ install tiers today.</p><h3>The Plugin Repo's Glass Ceiling</h3><p>Alex notes this "glass ceiling" has a lot to do with how the repo's search algorithm works. It's biased to favor plugins that have many active installs already, so if you're not there yet, it's not going to help you get there. As a result of these observations, Alex disrecommends the plugin repo for anyone thinking about launching a business there on the freemium model. He considers WP.org a poor distribution channel and assumes the freemium product model's fate is tied to it. On that point, we're doubtful and optimistic about exceptions and opportunities for plugin developers to make their own way, with or without the repo.</p><p>While Eric and I don't fully agree with Alex, his data-based analysis does establish that the plugin repository is "broken" if it's intended to be a place where a small entrepreneur with a good product can break in and take off.</p><h3>Let's Fix What's Broken (The Plugin Repo) Not What Isn't (The Freemium Model)</h3><p><strong>Matt Cromwell </strong>politely disagrees with Alex in a long, thoughtful post of his own:¬†<a href="https://www.mattcromwell.com/the-case-for-the-wordpress-plugin-freemium-model/" target="_blank">The Case for the WordPress Plugin Freemium Model</a>.¬†(There's a great <a href="https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/C0413T6GD/p1666180505764299">Post Status Slack thread</a> on it too.) In it, Matt describes ways plugin owners can make the¬†wp.org¬†plugin search engine work better for them, but he also notes a few of its deficiencies as well. His best point is that an average conversion rate is just that ‚Äî an average. He's seen much better results due to marketing efforts he feels are accessible to many plugin vendors. Matt also points to examples of successful freemium plugin shops, like <strong>Paid Memberships Pro</strong> which recently did¬†an A/B test¬†with their pricing page, and¬†<a href="https://twitter.com/jason_coleman/status/1582355558396743680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1582355558396743680%7Ctwgr%5E60ce4bbce4981ae7479f4aaa2a1b7b13c8467ff3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mattcromwell.com%2Fthe-case-for-the-wordpress-plugin-freemium-model%2F" target="_blank">the version with a freemium option converted better</a>.</p><p>Where Alex and Matt agree is how much the plugin repo has changed due to market saturation. It isn't an easy place to win in anymore. And I'm pretty sure Alex would agree with Matt this is true across the web as a whole ‚Äî you can expect to have to work hard with stiff competition and give high attention to <strong>Google</strong> as well ‚Äî not to mention all the other things that go into making and supporting a good product.</p><h3>Ideas for Improving the WordPress.org Plugin Repository</h3><p>Eric and I also discussed the excellent suggestions for useful, actionable data that product owners ‚Äî and even agencies ‚Äî would like from¬†<a href="https://poststatus.com/five-takes-on-helpful-plugin-stats-and-insights/" target="_blank">a new, improved plugin directory</a>.¬†<strong>Vito Peleg</strong>'s ideas are <a href="https://twitter.com/VitoPeleg/status/1577784069596876800" target="_blank">especially exciting</a>¬†and seemed to draw a nod from <strong>Matt Mullenweg</strong> on Twitter. We also note how better data for plugin owners might satisfy some needs that historically have led them to try all kinds of (often unpleasant) gimicks in the WordPress backend to connect with users and upsell or cross-market their products. In a comment at Post Status this week, <strong>Justin Labadie</strong> imagines <a href="https://poststatus.com/connect-freemium-plugins-to-premium-extension-sales/">how this could work as part of the plugin install process</a>, along with other suggestions. Eric connected this line of thinking with <strong>Mark Zahra</strong>'s question in a recent post at <strong>WP Mayor</strong>, <a href="https://wpmayor.com/is-deceptive-marketing-ruining-wordpress-reputation/">Is Deceptive Marketing Ruining WordPress‚Äô Reputation?</a></p><h3>Plugin Developers Must Make Their Own Way</h3><p>Eric asked (and answered) a big question at the <strong>WP Minute</strong>:¬†<a href="https://thewpminute.com/what-should-plugin-developers-expect-from-wordpress/" target="_blank">What should plugin developers expect from WordPress</a>? You've got to make your own way is a message I agree with, and I brought up my conversation with <strong>Till Kr√ºss</strong> about¬†<a href="https://poststatus.com/till-kruss-on-wordpress-performance-the-plugin-business-and-life/" target="_blank">Performance and the Plugin Business</a>¬†as an example of all the possibilities that open up if you think about meeting big needs nobody else is meeting or solving big problems others are creating!</p><h3>Follow the Leaders, Adopt Standards</h3><p>Where we end up is <strong>10up</strong>'s <a href="https://gutenberg.10up.com/">newly released resource site</a> for <strong>Gutenberg Best Practices</strong>. It's got tutorials, resources, references, example code ‚Äî and they're encouraging use of <a href="https://github.com/10up/gutenberg-best-practices/discussions">their GitHub discussion board for the site</a>. It's intended to go beyond the official WordPress documentation, according <strong>Fabian Kaegy</strong>'s <a href="https://10up.com/blog/2022/10up-publicly-releases-its-gutenberg-best-practices/">launch announcement</a>. It's a ‚Äúmore client-services-centric approach tailored to engineering enterprise-level editorial experiences.‚Äù</p><p>To me, that's a signal WordPress has turned a corner with Gutenberg. Top agency adoption of Gutenberg is huge, and as we see a growing body of accumulated knowledge, standards, and best practices emerging, it signals and amplifies a wave of change.</p><h3>Building Products to Scale Opens Doors and Creates Opportunities for Growth</h3><p>Toward the end of the show I suggest that plugin developers (as well as agencies) targeting middle and low-end markets have tended to neglect standards around performance testing and security because their customers don't need to scale and because they can treat performance and security as a hosting problem. That's a barrier to accessing high-value enterprise clients, hosts, and agencies connected to both. It represents lost opportunities and money left on the table.</p><h3>üîó Also mentioned in the show:</h3><p>Along with <a href="https://gutenberg.10up.com/">10up's Gutenberg resource hub</a>, several other future-facing WordPress sites sharing tools and knowledge catering to different audiences emerged in the last week or so:</p><ul><li><a href="https://olliewp.com/">Ollie</a> from <strong>Mike McAlister</strong> is shaping up to be "a blog where WordPress creators can get handy tips, tutorials, and tools for the WordPress block editor and full-site editing."</li><li><a href="https://wpturbo.dev/introducing-wpturbo/">WPTurbo</a> from <strong>Alex Borto</strong> offers more than <a href="https://wpturbo.dev/generators/">40 free WordPress code generators</a>, <a href="https://wpturbo.dev/snippets/">snippets saved by users</a>, and there's <a href="https://wpturbo.dev/blog/">a dev blog</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed7s5MFg_vs">Create Pro WordPress Page Layouts in Just 10 Minutes</a> from <strong>Jamie Marsland</strong> is a fun video tour of some layout design fundamentals that are really essential for good results with full-site editing and the block editor's power and flexibility.</li></ul><p>And, last but not least ‚Äî<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/wordpress-6-0-3-security-release/">WordPress 6.0.3 was released</a>.

      <title>Till Kr√ºss on Object Cache Pro, WordPress, plugins, testing, and performance ‚Äî Post Status Draft 126</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Back in August, I had a long conversation with <strong>Till Kr√ºss</strong> (edited down to <60 minutes here) about his path into <strong>WordPress</strong>, <strong>Laravel</strong>, and performance.

OCP offers a unique and highly successful model for partnerships between a WordPress plugin product business and a valuable niche market: hosting companies and anyone running WordPress sites at scale. <strong>Nexcess</strong> is <a href="https://www.nexcess.net/blog/nexcess-to-provide-premium-caching-to-all-customers-with-new-object-cache-pro-partnership/">the latest host to adopt</a> OCP, which they announced earlier this week.</p><p>Till‚Äôs particular niche is not for everyone, but some of his ideas and achievements are very portable.

End-to-end unit testing to ensure the highest code quality. It‚Äôs an idea that needs to become a reality and a habit in the third-party WordPress product ecosystem, Till believes ‚Äî and I think he‚Äôs right about that.</p><blockquote><p>What plugin owner has not felt the pain of an extraordinarily busy support forum?

      <title>Post Status Excerpt (No. 70) ‚Äî Trust and Distrust: Microagressions, Active Install Growth Data for Plugins, and Open Source Security</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Trust can be betrayed in so many ways or failed even with the best of intentions.</p><p><strong>Dan Knauss</strong></p></blockquote><p>In this episode of Post Status Excerpt, Dan and Ny take on three issues in the WordPress community that can threaten or impair trust while also revealing how foundational trust is, especially in open source.</p><p>First, they talk about Ny's article at MasterWP, "<a href="https://masterwp.com/enough-with-this-woke-stuff-and-other-racist-speech-you-can-unlearn/">Enough with this woke stuff: and other racist speech you can unlearn</a>," which explains microaggressions and received a significant number of macroaggressions in reply ‚Äî but also far more positive support from the community.</p><p>Next, "How do we rebuild trust when it's harmed?" is a question that leads into the biggest WordPress story of the week ‚Äî Matt Mullenweg's apparent decision to shut down access to active install data at the <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a> plugin repo due to an unspecified security breach and/or privacy concern. The way communication has happened ‚Äî or hasn't happened ‚Äî about this decision is clearly damaging trust in the WordPress community, particularly among business owners with a product in the plugin repository. Ny points out how this all looks to a newcomer to the WordPress community ‚Äî again, trust takes a beating. But while we lack clarity about the possible return of install data in some form, Dan suggests asking why this data is trusted and valued by many plugin owners. What business decisions can it helpfully inform? Are there alternative and possibly better sources of data about a plugin's users?</p><p>Finally, Dan briefly talks about the emergence of draft legislation in the US Senate: the Securing Open Source Software Act. It seems likely that in the near future, US security agencies will be getting people, dollars, and new organizations involved in assessing risk in open-source software. Are WordPress auto-updates critical supply chain infrastructure? When should individual freedoms be exchanged for collective security? When do we need to know what our machines and software are doing? When don't we? Zero-trust architecture might work well for networked machines, but human relationships and communities need trust.</p><h3>üîó Mentioned in the show:</h3><ul><li>Nyasha Green, <a href="https://masterwp.com/enough-with-this-woke-stuff-and-other-racist-speech-you-can-unlearn/">Enough with this woke stuff: and other racist speech you can unlearn</a> (MasterWP)</li><li>Mark Zahra, <a href="https://masterwp.com/a-sudden-change-leaves-wordpress-plugin-devs-in-the-dark/">A sudden change leaves WordPress plugin devs in the dark</a> (MasterWP)</li><li>Dan Knauss, <a href="https://poststatus.com/active-install-charts-removed-from-plugin-repo/">Active Install Charts Removed from Plugin Repo</a> (Post Status)</li><li>Dan Knauss, <a href="https://poststatus.com/open-source-communities-you-may-not-be-interested-in-cisa-but-cisa-is-very-interested-in-you/">Open Source Communities: You May Not Be Interested in CISA, But CISA is Very Interested in You</a> (Post Status)</li><li>Cory Doctorow, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/09/05/internet-of-lying-things.html">Our technology is haunted by demons controlled by transhuman life-forms</a></li></ul><h3>üëã Credits</h3><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/Ny_The_Creator">Nyasha Green</a>, Editorial Director at¬†<a href="https://twitter.com/_MasterWP">MasterWP</a>¬†(Twitter)</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/dan_knauss">Dan Knauss</a>, Editor for <a href="https://twitter.com/post_status">Post Status</a> (Twitter)</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/lemonadecode">Olivia Bisset</a>, Web Producer intern for <a href="http://twitter.com/post_status">Post Status</a> (Twitter)</li></ul><p>Every week <a href="https://poststatus.com/podcast/the-excerpt/"><strong>Post Status Excerpt</strong></a> will bring you a conversation about important news and issues in the WordPress community and business ecosystem. üéôÔ∏è</p><p>You can listen to <a href="https://poststatus.com/podcast/the-excerpt/">past episodes</a> of <strong>The Excerpt</strong>, <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/">browse all our podcasts</a>, and don‚Äôt forget to subscribe on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1m3xwXbe0MG5BzFVPtB0A7">Spotify</a>, Amazon Music, <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">iTunes</a>, <a href="https://castro.fm/podcast/c53552c6-1ee0-4fc4-9de4-08ed6bf1ee4d">Castro</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>, <a href="https://player.fm/series/wordpress-post-status-podcasts">Player.fm</a>, <a href="https://pca.st/05rR">Pocket Casts</a>, <a href="https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/">Simplecast</a>, or by <a href="https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P">RSS</a>. üéß</p>

      <title>Post Status Excerpt (63) ‚Äî Pay Transparency, Mutual Respect, and the Community We Need</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>People don't realize how long ago "long ago" wasn't. We're not talking about two, three, four hundred years ago. My family always stressed working somewhere your employer respects you, because it wasn't that long ago they didn't have a choice.</p><p>Nyasha Green</p></blockquote><p><i>We're rebooting <strong>Post Status Excerpt</strong> as a weekly chat between <strong>Nyasha Green</strong> and <strong>Dan Knauss</strong> (and guests‚Äîplease join us!) about a few of the active topics and discussions in the WordPress community that we feel are most important. Big thanks to <strong>David Bisset</strong> in his former role as host and curator here, and also to our intern and post-production engineer, <strong>Olivia Bisset</strong>.</i></p><p>This week we're talking about pay transparency. Ny relates some personal experiences where an employer did not disclose pay or how employees were selected for raises. This leads us into a discussion of pay transparency in the hiring process ‚Äî how it matters to everyone but especially job seekers who are black, indigenous, and other people of color. (Ny <a href="https://masterwp.com/put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is-why-we-need-pay-transparency-in-tech/">has written about this before</a>, and <strong>Piccia Neri</strong> has been investigating the topic lately.) We also talk about how a lack of transparency can seem to emphasize an employer's distrust and an employee's disadvantaged position ‚Äî and the effect that can have on a workplace culture.</p><p>Next, we talk about our own family histories which are touched ‚Äî in living memory in Ny's case ‚Äî by slavery and colonialism where work and dignity were extracted from some people by others with the power take their labor without compensation. Ny's great grandfather was born a slave in South Carolina in 1858 and lived until 1963. Dan's ancestors include German settlers in North Carolina who abandoned their earlier beliefs against slavery and began to practice it in the late 1700s. In the Americas and beyond, the past is much closer than we often assume, especially for BIPOC people. History only ‚Äúbends toward justice‚Äù if people choose to bend it that way. It can also go the other way.</p><p>Finally, we close with how <strong>Allie Nimmons</strong> experienced a surprising level of hostility to a survey she presented to the WordPress community about the ways we contribute to the project and how we feel about it. There's the community we have now ‚Äî and the community we need to become. How do we get there? What are the barriers?

      <title>Building and Sustaining the WordPress Community Through Mentorship ‚Äî Post Status Draft 123</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>Mentor someone. Today! Don't wait. Start today! Talk to people. Connect with them. Go on Twitter. Just 15 minutes a day. Tell them why this community is great. Make them want to join!</p><p>Nyasha Green</p></blockquote><p>For Nyasha Green, a healthy tech community prioritizes mentoring. She credits her mentors with helping her find her place in WordPress. How well does your part of the WordPress ecosystem support mentorship? Can we make mentoring a key way people contribute to WordPress's future?</p><p>In this episode of Post Status Draft, <strong>Nyasha Green</strong> joins <strong>Dan Knauss</strong> to tell her story about joining the WordPress community relatively recently. Ny is a Software Developer at <strong>Howard Development and Consulting</strong> as well as the Editorial Director for <strong>MasterWP</strong>. Ny credits <strong>Ken Elliot</strong> and <strong>Shambi Broome</strong> as mentors who got her into WordPress.

      <title>Post Status Excerpt ‚Äî A New Era of WordPress Themes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<h2>‚ÄúA style is the design language for a theme.‚Äù ‚ÄîRich Tabor</h2><p>In this episode, David Bisset talks with someone who has moved the WordPress theme needle a long way: <strong>Rich Tabor</strong>.

      <title>Introducing a new chapter, with Cory Miller as Post Status partner</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="https://poststatus.com/launched/">created</a> Post Status in January 2013 and <a href="https://poststatus.com/lets-grow/">started</a> the Club in January 2015. January 2020 marks another huge milestone for this community and business.</p><p>I‚Äôm very excited to share that <a href="https://corymiller.com/">Cory Miller</a> is now an equal partner of Post Status. Cory purchased half the business and will be working with me in the day-to-day management, writing, community engagement, and everything else we do with Post Status.</p><p>Many should know Cory from his ten years running <a href="https://ithemes.com/">iThemes</a>. After they sold the business to Liquid Web and he spent some time there, he decided to step away and continue his entrepreneurial journey. He‚Äôs working on a few projects, and Post Status is a significant part of where he‚Äôs dedicating his time and energy.</p><p>Cory is a long-time friend, and iThemes has been a Post Status sponsorship partner since 2015. Cory understands the community, the role Post Status plays in the space, and he brings so much to the table, from established community relationships to product and business experience.</p><p>We‚Äôve known one another going back to 2010 or so. I got to watch as he navigated the WordPress space as the CEO of a theme company turned plugin company, from inception to exit.</p><p>Cory has so many qualities I admire. Most of all, I admire his honesty, his compassion, his passion for people, and his vision for what‚Äôs possible. I look forward to working with a true partner on Post Status after so many years of managing the primary responsibilities with much help from many friends and contractors along the way.</p><p>In addition to Cory and myself, David Bisset and Dan Knauss continue to be integral parts of the Post Status effort. Cory and I are thankful for their energy, consistency, and talents.</p><p>We are working together in Oklahoma City this week to finalize our plans for the 2020 year. We already have a lot planned and are looking to get these new initiatives and processes off to a rocking start.</p><h3>Potential in the WordPress community</h3><p>There is so much potential in the WordPress community, and Post Status plays an important role through news, community, and professional development. We are going to continue to do that, and we are also going to make changes that we think will benefit the community as a whole and Post Status Club Members in particular.</p><p>If you‚Äôve ever thought about joining the <a href="https://poststatus.com/club">Post Status Club</a>, it‚Äôs a great time to do so. At a minimum, anyone in the WordPress community should subscribe to the <a href="/newsletter">newsletter</a>. If you‚Äôve been a member before, we thank you, and we hope we are able to continue to serve you for years to come ‚Äî better than ever, better together.</p><h3>Cory's thoughts</h3><p>I asked Cory to share a couple of his own thoughts on why he‚Äôs investing in Post Status, both with his money and energy.</p><blockquote><p>I‚Äôve been a fan and supporter of Post Status since the beginning. At iThemes we were one of Brian‚Äôs first sponsors. Over the years I leaned on Brian‚Äôs insights and counsel ‚Äî personally as well as through Post Status ‚Äî to inform and grow iThemes.</p><p>When Brian approached me about becoming a partner my first reaction was, ‚ÄúHeck yes!‚Äù Over our weeks and months of conversations, my excitement grew and grew as our goals and aspirations for Post Status were revealed to be so well aligned.</p><p>I truly believe in what Brian has built. And I only want to be a value add and look forward to coming alongside Brian, the Post Status team and this great community.</p></blockquote><p>We're so excited to finally be able to make this official. We look forward to continuing to serve you our readers, our Club members, our partners, and the broader community.</p>

How about the business community? Can smaller businesses make it? What threats exist: leadership, corporate, other platforms?</p><p>We cover a great deal here.

      <title>Chat with a WordPress skeptic</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I talked with Kira Leigh, a full-stack creative entrepreneur and consultant. Skeptic may be too strong of a word, but she makes it clear that she thinks WordPress is too often used when it‚Äôs not necessary.</p>
<p>Kira handles every part of her projects, which typically stem with marketing and copywriting, but she takes on design, development, and whatever is required to get the job done. She is the type of person who WordPress <em>should</em> be able to serve quite ably. But more than not, she would rather steer clear.</p>
<p>In this episode of the Draft Podcast, I talk to her about her work, why she is pained by WordPress, and try to come to some conclusions from it all. I am not sure if I accomplish much, but I do feel like I am better able to see where she‚Äôs coming from.</p>
<p>This conversation stemmed from a friend linking me to <a href="https://hackernoon.com/this-is-why-wordpress-sucks-and-you-should-probably-stop-using-it-v697y30v7">a post Kira wrote</a> that was (to my mind) a bit aggressive toward WordPress ‚Äî and while perhaps not 100% accurate, it is 100% her perception of the reality that is working with WordPress.</p>

      <title>WooCommerce vs Shopify: A battle for ecommerce platform dominance</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Ben Thompson recently wrote about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/shopify-and-the-power-of-platforms/">Shopify and the Power of Platforms</a>. He highlights the difference between an aggregator (e.g. Amazon‚Äôs Merchant Services) and a platform (Shopify) and makes a case for how Shopify can successfully compete against Amazon. If you‚Äôre new to Ben‚Äôs work, I highly recommend following the links he references in the opening paragraphs.</p>
<h3>Aggregators vs Platforms</h3>
<p>As Ben explains, Amazon is an aggregator that owns the users (i.e. customers, Amazon Prime subscribers) and aggregates the suppliers (i.e. merchants, manufacturers). Amazon succeeds by providing a great user experience (e.g. one click checkout, same day delivery) and by treating products and their suppliers as commodities, all available to the customer in a single, aggregated shopping experience. While aggregation can provide high value for customers, it minimizes the opportunity for merchants to differentiate and can ultimately hurt customers as competition and innovation are stifled.¬† </p>
<p>A competitor to Amazon might try becoming a larger aggregator. It‚Äôs a difficult endeavor. Walmart <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=walmart+vs+amazon">has been trying</a> for years. The larger an aggregator grows, the more entrenched their position, and the less likely a competitor can unseat them by utilizing the same strategy. </p>
<p>There is another way to compete with an aggregator. Build a platform.¬†</p>
<p>While an aggregator owns the customer and commoditizes its suppliers, a platform empowers those who build on it, relying on its suppliers being differentiated and successful in their own right.¬†</p>
<p>As Ben details in the article, Shopify‚Äôs best shot at taking on Amazon is to double-down on their focus as a platform and, by all evidence, that seems to be their strategy. Shopify wants to be the platform that empowers its merchants to succeed. </p>
<p>There are several problems I suggest with Shopify‚Äôs strategy, though.</p>
<ol><li><strong>Data Control</strong> ‚Äì Shopify has taken a strong stance on centralizing control of customer data and using their terms of service to enforce their policies. Their recent <a href="https://mailchimp.com/shopify-statement/">clash with MailChimp</a> (who decided to leave the platform) may be indicative of more to come. It makes sense to have a centralized source of truth for your data. Shopify‚Äôs position, though, is an all or nothing approach that results in more lock-in to the platform and more data in their control. Actions that stifle or remove <em>choice </em>from the equation for end users and the suppliers who serve them is aggregator thinking more than platform thinking. </li><li><strong>Closed Source</strong> ‚Äì Shopify is a proprietary platform with closed source code. While they make efforts to show <a href="http://shopify.github.io/">open source friendliness</a>, the reality is that the platform code is <em>theirs</em>. If you stop paying Shopify, you lose it all and if you don‚Äôt like what they‚Äôre doing with the platform, you‚Äôre stuck unless you choose to leave. </li><li><strong>Growth Risks</strong> ‚Äì Shopify is growing fast and as a publicly traded company, they are focused on accelerating growth. Products like Shopify Capital, and the emphasis on offline services through Point-of-Sale as well as the continued push into enterprise, deepen the risk of growing for growth‚Äôs sake, rather than doing what‚Äôs best for the merchants they serve. </li></ol>
<p>Shopify is a good<em> </em>solution for independent merchants who want to be more than an aggregated commodity. There are problems, though, and while Shopify is likely continue to grow despite the problems I‚Äôve suggested (they have no shortage of interested investors), there is a better approach. </p>
<h3>WooCommerce on WordPressOS</h3>
<p>In my writing on <a href="https://growinwp.com/ecosystem-plugins/">Ecosystem Plugins</a>, I introduced the concept of WordPress as an Operating System for the Open Web and cited WooCommerce as an example of an Ecosystem Plugin. </p>
<p>I believe strongly in the importance and value of WordPress as an Operating System, a <em>platform</em>, for the Open Web.¬†</p>
<p>With WooCommerce, I see potential for it to become <em>more </em>than an Ecosystem Plugin and serve as <em>the </em>platform for ecommerce on the Open Web.¬†</p>
<p>To do that, WooCommerce needs three things:</p>
<ol><li><strong>A great core experience</strong> ‚Äì Out-of-the-box, WooCommerce needs to have the essentials built-in and provide a great, user-focused onboarding and operating experience. It needs to be intuitive and accessible for non-technical, small business merchants, who should always be the core focus. Importantly, this is <em>not </em>about removing choices and dumbing interfaces down. This is about doing the <em>harder </em>work and teaching merchants how to make the right choices for them and use the power that WooCommerce provides. </li><li><strong>A vibrant partner ecosystem</strong> ‚Äì Shopify has nearly 3000 apps in its ‚ÄúApp Store‚Äù today. The WooCommerce marketplace has less than 300 extensions, and more than 30% are maintained by Automattic. For WooCommerce to succeed as a platform it needs to be trusted by its partners and seen as the <em>best </em>platform with clear short-term incentives and long-term value.</li><li><strong>A strong community</strong> ‚Äì WordPress‚Äô community is a <em>huge </em>key to its success. Meetups and WordCamps create a sense of belonging and shared ownership that drives a loyalty to WordPress that‚Äôs unparalleled. WooCommerce needs to create a similar community where merchants feel that they have each other‚Äôs<em> </em>backs and are able to share their love for the platform that makes it all possible.</li></ol>
<p>By many standards, Shopify is a giant compared to WooCommerce. With 4000+ employees, a $35+ billion dollar market cap, and a marketing budget to match, they seem to be the dominate ecommerce platform and show no signs of slowing down their efforts. </p>
<p>You can‚Äôt buy trust, vibrancy, and loyalty though. Deepening trust through a great core experience, investing in the partner ecosystem, and strengthening community loyalty is where I think WooCommerce has the opportunity to improve and succeed. </p>
<p>Here are three ideas for WooCommerce to increase its value and strengthen its position as <em>the</em> platform for ecommerce on the Open Web:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Introduce a WooCommerce Subscription</strong> ‚Äì Provide access to non-SaaS extensions for a flat, monthly rate and easy bundling of SaaS billing for those who want it. Make it a clear win for all involved, including the merchants and marketplace partners. Position the subscription as an investment in the Open Web. The code is GPL ‚Äì they could stop paying at any time and keep access. Paying, though, provides support and capital for reinvestment, ensuring the continued success of the platform. A subscription also offers opportunity to streamline the user experience for customers, reducing friction for developers.</li><li><strong>Invest in the Partner Ecosystem</strong> ‚Äì Make building a healthy partner ecosystem a priority. Provide guidance, mentorship, and funding to help developers succeed on the WooCommerce platform. Build strong relationships with SaaS providers, including ecommerce focused companies like BigCommerce, and help streamline their integrations into the platform.¬† </li><li><strong>Cultivate Community</strong> ‚Äì Invest in and support ecommerce meetups and create more ecommerce focused events. Double-down on the Open Web narrative and encourage community members to support each other in improving and maintaining their freedom as merchants on the Open Web. </li></ol>
<p>Shopify provides a valuable service that empowers merchants. Unfortunately, their approach to centralized data control, their closed source platform, and the risks of a growth focus pose the potential for more harm than good. </p>
<p>I believe that WooCommerce, with data control in the hands of its users, an open source ecosystem, and a strong independent community give it the opportunity to become the <em>best </em>platform for ecommerce on the Open Web. </p>

<p>I met Anil at <a href="https://cabopress.com/">CaboPress</a> and we had a great chat, which we followed up with in this episode, recorded at WordCamp US. Anil has a great story and a lot of insight. I hope you enjoy.</p>

      <title>Why the makers of Ninja Forms are getting into eCommerce</title>

Post Status Draft is hosted by Brian Krogsgard and co-host Brian Richards.</p>
<p>In this episode, I bring on James Laws and Kevin Stover -- cofounders of Saturday Drive, the parent company of Ninja Forms -- to discuss why they are entering the world of eCommerce. I found this especially interesting given the market dominance of WooCommerce for general WordPress-based eCommerce needs.</p>
<p>Saturday Drive purchased Exchange, the plugin initially developed by iThemes and then handed off to A.J. Morris, with the intention of making a play for the eCommerce market, much like they did successfully once already for the somewhat-saturated forms market.</p>

Post Status Draft is hosted by Brian Krogsgard and co-host Brian Richards.</p>
<p>In this episode, Brian is joined by guest-host <a href="https://twitter.com/casjam">Brian Casel</a>. Brian runs <a href="https://audienceops.com/">Audience Ops</a>, a productized service that offers all aspects of content creation for companies. Brian has been in the WordPress community for a long time, and for years has worked on creating processes around his business to enable him to get beyond a freelancer work life and into treating services like products.</p>
<p>Before Audience Ops, he ran Restuarant Engine -- a niche WordPress site provider, where he really honed many of the processes his company still uses today -- which he sold for six figures.</p>
<p>We dig in to why he decided to make a transformation with his businesses to be so process oriented, and how he turned that into the 30-person organization it is today, as well as the various courses and communities around Productize and Scale.</p>

Post Status Draft is hosted by Brian Krogsgard and co-host Brian Richards.</p>
<p>In this episode, Brian and Brian discuss meta data in WordPress, including the challenge of implementing data into new tools, such as the REST API and the Gutenberg editor.</p>
<p>With the endless options of data complexity that‚Äôs historically possible with meta fields, the way these features are implemented into new projects has to be well thought out. There is continued activity with both the REST API and Gutenberg to make sure meta is well supported. There are several things that are worth knowing, if you are a consultant or a product maker in regard to working with WordPress meta.</p>

Post Status Draft is hosted by Brian Krogsgard and co-host Brian Richards.</p>
<p>In this episode, Brian and Brian discuss the power of network effects and how they relate to WordPress‚Äô increasing market share and maturity. WordPress has recently hit two major milestones, turning 15 years old and reaching 30% market share of the top 10 million websites, and we spend this episode reflecting on the innovations that brought us here and where innovations are likely to occur over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>We‚Äôve come quite a long way in these 15 years. From the famous 5-minute install to being entirely pre-installed. From a supportive band of volunteers and vast ecosystem of free software to the commercially supported and highly-polished products that exist today. There is a lot about WordPress to be thankful for, and a lot of great things that will exist in the future because of it. And you can hear a bit about all of that on this episode of the Post Status Draft podcast.</p>

      <title>How WebDevStudios is serving different market segments</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast">Google Play</a>, <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>, and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher. Post Status Draft is hosted by Brian Krogsgard and co-host Brian Richards.</p>
<p>In this episode, Lisa Sabin-Wilson shares about the entangled history of WebDevStudios and eWebscapes and how she and team are targeting every level of the market. WebDevStudios focuses heavily on the upper and enterprise market segments, providing a high degree of attention and support to those clients.</p>
<p>Sometime in 2017 Lisa did the math on all the lower-end projects that they were referring away and realized that WDS had a prime opportunity to re-introduce her former web studio, eWebscapes, as a way to serve these smaller-scope projects. This rebirth, so to speak, has positioned them to better target local communities, provide staff with more variety of work, and bring simplified processes alongside those they use for larger projects.</p>
<h3>Key take-aways</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Lisa observed a market opportunity and did the math first</li>
 	<li>Relaunching started with a solid content strategy</li>
 	<li>Simplified processes for managing a project</li>
 	<li>Utilized talent already on staff</li>
 	<li>Lots of opportunity to target local communities</li>
 	<li>Evaluating the success of this strategy after 6 months</li>

<p>In this episode, Brian and Brian continue their discussion on WordPress market opportunities with a focus on the upper-market and enterprise clients.

There are plenty of positives and negatives when working on long-term projects that may have a dramatic impact on your company in many ways.</p>
<p>In addition to these market opportunities, the boys also discuss recent news including iThemes acquisition by Liquid Web, a welcome change to the WordPress.org plugin directory, and an unfortunate and far-reaching bug that shipped with the 4.9.3 release last week.</p>

<p><span>In this episode, Brian and Brian discuss market segmentation across the WordPress ecosystem. The focus for this discussion focused entirely on the entry-level segment of site assemblers and their small-business clients as well as the mid-level market of contractors and agencies selling additional levels of service. The duo talked through a few different strategies employed in each segment, including service differentiation, regional focus, building a network of complementary contractors, systemizing processes, delivering quality customer support flow, and selling ongoing service. </span></p>
<p><span>In addition to this look at market segmentation, the Brians shared a few useful resources for both Gutenberg and WP-CLI.</span></p>

<p>In this episode, I am joined by Matt Mullenweg, the CEO of Automattic and the co-founder of WordPress. In this episode, we discuss a range of issues facing WordPress today, as well as the various arms of Automattic's business:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>WordPress 4.9 features around customization.</li>
 	<li>Progress on the Gutenberg Editor</li>
 	<li>Feature projects and a year of day-to-day project lead</li>
 	<li>The React decision for WordPress, and what came of it</li>
 	<li>WooCommerce, Jetpack and issues they are facing</li>
 	<li>Site building versus blogging on WordPress.com, and their ad campaigns</li>
 	<li>WordPress community, the WordPress website</li>
 	<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
This was a fun episode, and it's always a privilege to be able to talk to the leader of the WordPress project. I hope you enjoy it.

In this episode, I interview <a href="https://twitter.com/asmartbear">Jason Cohen</a>, the founder of WP Engine and current CTO.</p>
<p>I talked to Jason about a whole lot of things, mostly to do with growing well. Whether you're growing revenue, company size, or personal development -- this is a conversation about growth, and how to do it well.</p>
<p>Unlike many entrepreneurs in the WordPress space, WP Engine isn't Jason's first business. He's done this before, and made plenty of mistakes. He talks about what he's done differently at WP Engine and how its made him a happier person.</p>
<p>This interview took place at LoopConf, and Jason was a keynote presenter. His LoopConf talk pairs well with our discussion.</p>

<p>We recorded this prior to the announcement of the <a href="https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-state-word-2016/">new development schedule</a> and changes to major releases, but most of our conversation remains relevant, as many of our wishlist items are within the three release focus areas that have been chosen.</p>

      <title>Interview with Matt Mullenweg on the new WordPress release cycle and more</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>During contributor day of WordCamp US in Philadelphia, I was able to interview Matt Mullenweg to follow up on several items he announced in the <a href="https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-state-word-2016/">State of the Word</a>.</p>
<p>We mostly discussed the new WordPress development cycle and how it will work with the three focus areas. We also discussed how that will affect other non-major updates and WordPress features.</p>
<p>Matt also talked about the WordPress REST API, how he defines success¬†for it, what he hopes to see out of it, and what he thinks would cause it to revert to a plugin only feature.</p>
<p>And as this was the second and final year of WordCamp US in Philadelphia, we reflected on the event, and talked about what there is to look forward to in Nashville for WordCamp US 2017 and 2018.</p>

<p>And as this was the second and final year of WordCamp US in Philadelphia, we reflected on the event, and talked about what there is to look forward to in Nashville for WordCamp US 2017 and 2018.</p>

      <title>Rejuvenating old software products, with Pippin Williamson</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of Post Status Draft, I¬†talk to <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com">Pippin Williamson</a>, and we discuss the renewed effort he and his team have made to rejuvenate Restrict Content Pro.</p>
<p><a href="https://restrictcontentpro.com/">Restrict Content Pro</a> was initially sold without even a dedicated landing page, was successful on <a href="https://codecanyon.net/">Code Canyon</a> for a time, then he let it sputter as he and his team concentrated on Easy Digital Downloads and AffiliateWP.</p>
<p>But Pippin knew that Restrict Content Pro still had more life in it, and he wanted to see it become the kind of product he knew it had the potential to be. So when John Parris -- at the time primarily working with Easy Digital Downloads -- said he was interested in helping make RCP a proper membership plugin, Pippin jumped on the opportunity.</p>
<p>They have had a good bit of success early on in the <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/rebuilding-dying-product/">attempt to rejuvenate this product</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Our goal was to double or triple the monthly revenue within six months. In March, 2016, RCP brought in $7,700. Last month, July 2016, it brought in $11,400.¬†August, 2016, is estimated to bring in a little over $12,000.
<p>We‚Äôre at the five month mark and have increased monthly revenue by about 1.5. That‚Äôs not double yet, but it‚Äôs getting close. Within another few months, I expect we‚Äôve surpass $15,000 in monthly sales. Even with just an increase of 1.5, we‚Äôre still looking at more than $100,000 in annual revenue, and the monthly revenue is higher than¬†it¬†ever was in the past, so we‚Äôre succeeding.</blockquote><br />
Our conversation picked up where the blog post left off. We talked about the pain points they encountered during this effort, some of the additional rewards they've had, and how he structures the business more generally to have the same team work on multiple products.</p>
<p>If you are a business owner, or aspire to be one -- or if you are curious about managing multiple lines of business at once -- then I think you'll really enjoy this episode.</p>
<p>And, if you're a <a href="https://poststatus.com/club">Post Status Club</a> member, Pippin and I recorded a bonus segment, where we discuss hosted WordPress eCommerce, and Pippin shares his opinions on the concept, and whether or not it's something they are considering for Restrict Content Pro and/or Easy Digital Downloads.</p>

      <title>WordPress 4.6, &quot;Pepper&quot;</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>WordPress 4.6, ‚ÄúPepper‚Äù, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/08/pepper/">has been released</a>. It‚Äôs named, as always, after a famous jazz musician, and this release is named after¬†<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_Adams">Park Frederick &quot;Pepper&quot; Adams III</a>, a baritone saxophonist and jazz composer.</p>
<p>The¬†Release Lead for WordPress 4.6 was <a href="https://dominikschilling.de/">Dominik Schilling</a>, known often as Ocean90,¬†and¬†the Deputy Release Lead was <a href="https://www.garthmortensen.com/">Garth Mortensen.</a>¬†There were¬†272 total contributors to this release. According <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronjorbin/status/765631441950703617">to Aaron Jorbin</a>, 85 of these contributors were first timers, so congratulations to all new WordPress contributors!</p>
<p>For this release, we did a special episode of the¬†Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a>,¬†<a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast">Google Play</a>,¬†<a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>,¬†and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher. Post Status Draft is hosted by Joe Hoyle ‚Äî the CTO of Human Made ‚Äî and me, Brian Krogsgard.</p>
<p>In this episode, Joe and I discuss¬†WordPress 4.6 and deep dive on a few of its features.</p>
<h2>About¬†WordPress 4.6</h2>
<p>Overall, this was a planned iterative release from the beginning, with¬†a¬†goal to fix as many longstanding bugs as possible, and to refine existing features, rather than to focus on a lot of brand new features.</p>
<p>Folks have been clamoring for a release like this for a long time, and in most respects 4.6 delivered. <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/4.6">According to Trac</a>, 489 tickets were closed, across 53 components, during the 4.6 milestone. Also, it shipped exactly on time.</p>
<h2>User facing features</h2>
WordPress 4.6 has a few¬†user facing features that aren't huge functional changes, but nice interface enhancements.
<h3>Shiny updates</h3>
No more <em>bleak screen of sadness</em>, as the team working on this termed it. The plugin installation, updates, and delete process is much smoother than it used to be. There's a nice video of this <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/06/02/proposal-more-shiny-updates/">from the initial proposal</a>:
<p>This was the second release where &quot;shiny updates&quot; features were a focus. To see some under the hood considerations for developers, there's <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/06/shiny-updates-in-4-6/">more information on that</a> from Pascal Birchler.</p>
<h3>Native fonts</h3>
WordPress is leaving Open Sans.¬†You may have seen GitHub‚Äôs change to native fonts. Or if you‚Äôre running 4.6 in development, you‚Äôve seen native fonts replace Open Sans in the admin¬†too.¬†Matt Miklic <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/07/native-fonts-in-4-6/">explains the switch</a> from Open Sans to native system fonts in the WordPress admin.
<p>By the way, the declaration of fonts has a good bit of science behind it, and may be useful for those of you who wish to do something similar for your site body copy. Marcin Wichary has a really interesting post <a href="https://medium.design/system-shock-6b1dc6d6596f#.n2idzpgry">describing Medium's process</a> for the switch.</p>
<p>And if you're curious, the new declaration is this:</p>
<pre>font-family:¬†-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;</pre>
<h3>Inline link checker</h3>
WordPress will now automatically detect improperly formatted links, as you write. While this doesn't check the validity of any properly written URL, it will ensure the URL you add in an <code>href</code>¬†is properly formatted. So, it will catch if you accidentally type something like <code>htp://w.org</code>¬†or <code>http:/w.org</code>¬†and outline it in read for you to fix.
<p>If you copy and past a URL into the link editor, but don't include <code>http://</code>¬†at all (I do this a bunch), it auto detects and inserts it for you.</p>
<h3>Browser content caching</h3>
Yet more efforts have been made to always ensure that you do not lose your content as you write. I followed the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37025">steps in the Trac ticket</a> to see exactly what happens here.
<p>So I typed the first sentence below, saved a draft, then typed the second paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>What if I start typing and save a draft?
<p>Then start typing some more, because that's what bloggers do. And I chill here for a few seconds, then stupidly just reload this page?</blockquote><br />
Then I reloaded the page without saving again, and got a notice that there is a more up to date version available.</p>
<p>And just like that, the content is back, because it was saved in the browser's local storage. Pretty cool.</p>
<h2>Developer features</h2>
There are several important developer centric features that you should know about.
<h3>Enhanced meta data registration</h3>
This is a significant aid to the (pending) REST API meta handling, but also improves other meta data functionality. The <code>register_meta()</code>¬†function allows developers to tell WordPress more about what specific meta data is designed to do. In WordPress 4.6, the arguments for this function have changed, enabling more information to be communicated in the third parameter, which is now an array.
<p>The <code>show_in_rest</code>¬†key, an experimental key (until the API endpoint goes in), finally solves the issue for the REST API for knowing when to include meta data in the API's default responses. It's one step of a few that need to be made to better support meta for the API, but it's a good step forward.</p>
<p>For plugin developers not using <code>register_meta()</code>, be sure to learn more about it and the advantages, as there are quite a few. Jeremy Felt describes how to use <code>register_meta</code>¬†<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/20/additional-register_meta-changes-in-4-6/">on Make Core</a>.</p>
<h3>Translation priorities and changes</h3>
WordPress will now default to the translations from <a href="https://translate.wordpress.org">Translate.WordPress.org</a>¬†community translations, then pull from theme or plugin translation files. A procedure called¬†‚Äújust-in-time‚Äù¬†translation loading will be utilized, and for plugins and themes distributed through the official repository, <code>load_plugin_textdomain()</code>¬†and <code>load_theme_textdomain()</code>¬†no longer need to be used.
<p>Commercial plugin authors will¬†still largely follow the same internationalization procedures they¬†always have.</p>
<p>In a related note, and quite impressively, WordPress 4.6 shipped 100% translated in 50+ languages.</p>
<h3>Resource hints</h3>
Joe helped teach me more about resource hints on the podcast, and Aaron did a much better job detailing resource hints than I could, in his <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/26/wordpress-4-6-field-guide/">excellent field guide</a>:
<blockquote>Resource Hints is a rather new <a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-hints/">W3C specification</a> that <em>‚Äúdefines the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-hints/#dfn-dns-prefetch"><code>dns-prefetch</code></a>, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-hints/#dfn-preconnect"><code>preconnect</code></a>, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-hints/#dfn-prefetch"><code>prefetch</code></a>, and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/resource-hints/#dfn-prerender"><code>prerender</code></a> relationships of the HTML Link Element (<code></code>)‚Äù</em>. These can be used to assist the browser in the decision process of which origins it should connect to, and which resources it should fetch and preprocess to improve page performance.
<p>In 4.6, WordPress adds an API to register and use resource hints. The relevant ticket is <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34292">#34292</a>.</p>
<p>Developers can use the <code>wp_resource_hints</code> filter to add custom domains and URLs for <code>dns-prefetch</code>,¬†<code>preconnect</code>, <code>prefetch</code> or <code>prerender</code>. One needs to be careful to not add too many resource hints as they could quite easily <em>negatively</em> impact performance, especially on mobile.</blockquote><br />
Resource hints can be very useful for certain situations, and it's a technique that I personally need to explore further. Those of you doing advanced performance-driven development will surely be excited about support for this in WordPress.</p>
<h3>Customizer APIs</h3>
The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/06/customize-api-changes-in-4-6/">Customize API continues to evolve</a> and improve, and Nick Halsey walks through new developer-focused features¬†and changes to the API for WordPress 4.6. Also quite notably, Weston Ruter describes <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/05/customizer-apis-in-4-6-for-setting-validation-and-notifications/">new APIs for both settings validation and notification management</a> in the customizer.
<h3>Other developer-centric changes</h3>
<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/08/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-6/">Multisite changes</a>: Jeremy Felt describes <code>WP_Site_Query</code>¬†and¬†<code>WP_Network_Query</code>, and goes over a few new functions and filters.
<p>There is now a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/18/comments-in-4-6-can-now-be-cached-by-a-persistent-object-cache/">persistent comment cache</a>, allowing more performant comment loading functionality.</p>
<p>The WordPress HTTP API <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/27/http-api-in-4-6/">now uses the Requests library</a>, as Ryan McCue describes.</p>
<p>Aaron Jorbin describes some of the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/06/bootstrapload-updates-in-4-6/">lower level WordPress loading priorities</a> and defaults that have changed. He also describes how WP CLI and core have reconciled their differences in <code>wp-settings.php</code>, which makes backward compatability for WP CLI possible now.</p>
<p>Boone Gorges <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/06/wp_term_query-in-wordpress-4-6/">describes the introduction of <code>WP_Term_Query</code></a>. He‚Äôs the term whisperer. As Joe and I discuss in the podcast, these sorts of changes make for better consistency in WordPress, and provide an improved developer experience.</p>
<h2>Learn more</h2>
WordPress 4.6 is the result of hundreds of community members. You can find¬†their names and links to their profiles on <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/08/pepper/">the official release post</a>.
<p>Also check out the official <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.6">4.6 Codex page</a> that has a lot of handy information and links to source Trac tickets. You can see all closed tickets from <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/4.6">4.6 on the Trac milestone</a>. View all new functions, classes, methods, and hooks <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/since/4.6.0/">on the official Developer Reference</a>. And learn more about some of what I discuss above, and other items, on the ever-helpful <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/07/26/wordpress-4-6-field-guide/">field guide</a>.</p>
<p>For the record, WordPress 4.5 was downloaded more than 45 million times. You can <a href="https://wordpress.org/download/counter/">track 4.6 downloads</a> on the page dedicated to the task.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who contributed to WordPress 4.6! I hope you have a üç∫ or¬†üçª to celebrate if that's your kind of thing, or otherwise üéâ ¬†your efforts.</p>

<p><span>Everybody creates workflows to accomplish their development work. And sometimes you come upon a new tool that completely changes how you do things, and helps you improve your productivity.</span></p>
<p><span>In this episode, Joe and Brian aim to share their tools in the hopes that it will help others review and refine their own processes. And Joe and Brian approach things quite differently themselves, so they compare and contrast their own workflows. Have something to add to the conversation, be sure to comment!</span></p>

      <title>WordPress Questions &amp; Answers</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a>,¬†<a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>,¬†and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher. Post Status Draft is hosted by Joe Hoyle -- the CTO of Human Made -- and Brian Krogsgard.</p>
<p><span>Today, we answer questions from Post Status community members, who asked us all sorts of stuff on the <a href="https://poststatus.com/ask/">Post Status Ask</a> page. If you'd like to ask a question, be sure to go there and we'll see if we can answer it on a future show.</span></p>
<h3>Questions & Links</h3>
<span>We answered the following questions:</span>
<p><strong>Why WordPress?</strong></p>
<p>In a survey I did before my PressNomics talk, the top answer for what's important to people in regards to the WordPress world was the quality of the community. WordPress' ubiquity -- powering 26% of the web -- helps too.</p>
<p><strong>What is the biggest mistake you made learning WordPress? (Or, what would you do differently?)</strong></p>
<p>Joe and I each shared what we tend to do wrong when learning new things. We are fully on opposite ends of the spectrum. Recommended link: <a href="http://justbuildwebsites.com/">Just Build Websites</a>. Also, my post on <a href="https://poststatus.com/learn-wordpress-development/">learning WordPres</a>s holds up pretty well, considering I wrote it in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Why did a lot of web and WordPress people get upset about the Mandrill pricing changes, when we want people to value the work we're doing ourselves?</strong></p>
<p>We discuss what made Mandrill's pricing changes controversial, and why we think some level of &quot;outcry&quot; is understandable here. Basically, Mandrill isn't differentiated enough to warrant the new pricing, in our opinions. However, it's obviously their right to change their pricing and structure, and the questioner has a valid point in how we value other services versus our own.</p>
<p><strong>Why isn't the WordPress importer being worked on more intensively?</strong></p>
<p>Good question! We talk about the state of the importer, some other options like <a href="https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/">WP Migrate DB Pro</a>, <a href="http://www.wpallimport.com/">WP All Import</a>, and <a href="http://wp-cli.org/commands/import/">WP CLI</a>. We also discuss how to get involved with open source development.</p>
<p><strong>Should taxonomies have the same feature capabilities as posts in the future?</strong></p>
<p>There's been a lot of interesting work on taxonomies in the last several releases, and you can read more about some of that and find links going back from my <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-4-4/">release post for WordPress 4.4</a>. However, we think taxonomies and posts should be different. With the introduction of term meta, it is more important to consider architectural choices well in advance. Finally, the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/fields-api/">Fields API</a> will be interesting in how it affects customizing term edit screens.</p>
<p><strong>How should I use my own domains with Multisite?</strong></p>
<p>This turned interesting! Fortunately, Multisite component maintainer Jeremy Felt came through while we were on the show to point us to tickets that were merged in WordPress 3.9 for <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27003">enabling simpler domain mapping</a>, and in 4.3, when <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22383">a better UI was introduced</a>. So, today, it's much easier to use a custom domain in a network -- within the existing WordPress Multisite options interface -- versus using a tool like <a href="https://github.com/humanmade/Mercator">Mercator</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>In addition to these questions, we also banter on about some other things and answer a few less serious questions we go from funny listeners. And at the end, I make a pretty big announcement...</p>

<p>In addition to these questions, we also banter on about some other things and answer a few less serious questions we go from funny listeners. And at the end, I make a pretty big announcement...</p>

In today‚Äôs episode, we discuss WordPress and SaaS in two contexts: one, using WordPress as a technology basis for a SaaS in another industry, and two, creating a SaaS catered to the WordPress world.</span></p>

Post Status Draft is hosted by Joe Hoyle -- the CTO of Human Made -- and Brian Krogsgard.</p>
<p>WordPress hosting is always a hot topic of conversation, due to the difficult task of differentiating one host from another. There is also a lot of money and marketing involved in the industry -- an industry that includes some of the largest companies in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>
<p>In this episode, Joe and I attempt to break down what different types of hosting are available, how they are applicable to WordPress, and even dig in to some of the drama and politics that surround the hosting world.</p>
<p>The techical part of the conversation is the first 50 minutes or so, and around that mark, we get into the politics and non-technical issues around WordPress hosting, as well as tell some stories of how companies have successfully marketed themselves by getting embedded in the WordPress community.</p>

<p><span>HTTPS and HTTP/2 are somewhat intertwined, and a lot has been going on lately in this realm. Google has made a big push to encourage the use of SSL for websites -- including making it a search ranking factor -- and LetsEncrypt and other services are offering new ways to deliver free SSL certificates, securely. And HTTPS is required for HTTP/2, which is making a big splash as well, quickly outpacing SPDY. Today, we‚Äôll talk about what these terms are, and what it means for the web and for WordPress.</span></p>

      <title>Interview with Automattic CEO, Matt Mullenweg, on Calypso and more</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I had the opportunity to interview Matt Mullenweg about an ¬†¬†ambitious project that included more than a year and a half of development to create an all new WordPress.com interface, both for the web and a desktop app. The project was codenamed Calypso, and we talked about many aspects fo Calypso, as well ¬†as a ¬†¬†variety of subjects that relate to it.</p>
<h3>Why ¬†did you make such a big bet on Calypso?</h3>
Matt has talked for a while now about his vision that WordPress can become an "app platform", and this is an example of what that meant to him.
<p>He also notes how he's always ¬†looking for things that will &quot;move the needle&quot; for greater WordPress adoption. We were both thinking about the same statistic: that <a href="https://poststatus.com/2013-state-of-the-word-from-matt-mullenweg/">roughly 96% of WordPress.com users</a> (and probably a high number of WordPress.org users too) essentially abandon their websites after a short tenure. So anything that can increase that number, to say 8% or 15% of folks that stick with it long term, can make a huge difference.</p>
<h3>How do you think about investing in feature development for WordPress.com, and how it affects ¬†WordPress as well?</h3>
When Matt considers what he wants to invest Automattic developer and designer time in, he says he thinks of WordPress as a whole first, before considering specifics for WordPress.com. He'd rather see WordPress.com as a gateway to a self-hosted install. And whether they stay on .com or move to a self-hosted install, he wants to help ensure that their problems are solved.
<h3>WordPresses</h3>
I guess it's new to me, because Matt says he's been saying it for years, but he calls WordPress websites "WordPresses", after a long time debate internally about whether to call WordPress.com sites sites or blogs.
<h3>WordPress.com as a network versus a platform</h3>
The new homepage for logged in users, or users in the WordPress.com app, default to the Reader view of the WordPress.com interface, versus the writing view. This intrigued me, as I don't personally think of WordPress.com as a read-first ecosystem, but rather a place to write. I think more of Tumblr or Medium when I think of a destination for reading, where I may write.
<p>Matt ¬†and I talked about the merits of WordPress as a network versus a platform. He thinks it can be both. And I think this touches on one of the big goals for Calypso that we haven't discussed yet: to make WordPress a better network.</p>
<p>To me, WordPress.com is a platform, but WordPress (both .com and Jetpack enabled sites) are ripe to be a hugely successful network, through the huge number of websites and independent publishers that are interconnected via WordPress.com.</p>
<p>There is more evidence that this is a goal for them too, with the <a href="https://discover.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/hello-world/">launch of Discover WordPress</a> along with the release of the new interface. Discover WordPress is a project by the editorial team to surface the best writing across WordPress.com and Jetpack enabled websites.</p>
<p>Furthermore, beyond the human curated content, much could be done in the future algorithmically. We didn't get as much into this stuff as I would've liked, but I think it's ¬†an enormous growth area for Automattic.</p>
<h3>Open Sourcing Calypso</h3>
The Calypso <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso">project code</a> is fully open source, and is a top trending project on Github right now. There are few requirements to run the code locally, so you can pretty quickly get a working web view.
<p>There are a slew of <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/master/client/components">fancy React components</a> that could be pretty easily lifted from Calypso and used independently, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/docs/guide/hello-world.md">guide to getting started</a> with the full codebase.</p>
<h3>How can the community anticipate ¬†the future, with ¬†more abstracted implementations of WordPress?</h3>
As WordPress projects continue to use REST APIs to create fully custom frontends, backends, and inbetweens, I was curious what Matt thinks the community can do to anticipate and educate users on how to deal with these scenarios, that may fragment WordPress and be confusing for people who expect WordPress plugins and code to interract well with one another.
<p>He doesn't think it's too much of a problem, but says it's important that we experiment and learn from our experiments; he was hesitant to call the potential for confusion fragmentation as much as experimentation. Either way, I do think education and documentation will be important as other folks continue to use parts of WordPress to make impressive things, without supporting every specific thing that can also run on WordPress.</p>
<p>An example of this is the WordPress.com app itself. You can manage¬†¬† Jetpack enabled sites through it, but that doesn't mean you get everything in the editor you'd get with a WordPress.org site, like custom fields and other plugin functionality that the desktop app doesn't support.</p>
<h3>What is Automattic's differentiating factor?</h3>
I wanted to know what Automattic's differentiating factor is, in Matt's mind. He defaulted, I guess unsurprisingly, to "everything", but as I pushed him a little further, he dug a bit more into some of the things that make Automattic interesting.
<p>From a WordPress.org ¬† perspective, WordPress.com integrated tools like Stats, VaultPress, and Akismet are difficult to match with other tools.</p>
<p>For ¬†WordPress.com, he thinks the potential power of the Reader and network can be compelling. I agree there that the diversity of the WordPress.com and Jetpack author ¬†audience could make for a compelling Reading product, that has more potential than I see right now in a competitor ¬†¬†like Medium, which is very tech heavy.</p>
<p>Matt ¬†¬†says, ¬†¬†[pullquote align=&quot;right&quot;]&quot;We've built up a lot of trust in the community, and that goodwill definitely pays back.&quot;[/pullquote] Part of what makes it hard to identify Automattic's specific differentiator is that they do a lot of things. Matt acknoledged this, but counters by saying that they work hard on user experience and being a good community citizen.</p>
<h3>How have teams changed at Automattic over time?</h3>
Automattic scales by splitting teams when they get too big. Today, there are 46 teams. Some of those teams are embedded in larger teams and have some hierarchy, but the company is still quite flat for a company of 400 people.
<p>The rule of thumb Matt wants¬†¬† to maintain is that someone should have ¬†¬†no more than 10 people that report directly to them, though he has around 23.</p>
<p>According to the standards of the tech world, Automattic's scale in terms of the number of employees may be somewhat ordinary, but they have still had massive and consistent change over the decade of the company's existence. And they are hiring as fast as they can to this day.</p>
<h3>The challenge of customizing WordPress sites</h3>
A couple of years ago, someone from Automattic told me how concerned they were about the WordPress customizer's ability to scale, both for use on mobile devices, and as a utility that could manage a lot of features. And I wanted to know how Matt thinks that has evolved, now that the customizer is in such significant use on both WordPress.com and for self-hosted websites.
<p>As he notes, the customizer has undergone a lot of positive iteration over the last several releases, and today the WordPress.com and WordPress.org customizers are using the same base code; whereas for a while WordPress.com had their own custom implementation.</p>
<p>But he still says that, &quot;if we're candid with ourselves, ... customization is still the ¬†worst part of WordPress, you know? ¬†It's the hardest. It's ¬†where people get stuck. It's where there's a real gap between the promise and what people are able to realize and create when they get started using WordPress.&quot;</p>
<p>It's not as much a problem with the use of themes, or if you can code, but for new users, &quot;it's their biggest struggle.&quot;</p>
<p>One idea that I have is to have a more Medium-like interface be the &quot;default&quot; view, versus a changing default theme. That way, WordPress.com could be more opinionated about the default view, and change the theme at will, or along with trends, versus giving new users the default theme of a particular year and then that theme is untouched unless the user decides to switch.</p>
<p>Matt said they have that a bit on the Reader view, but that is what someone in the WordPress.com network would see, versus what an outside website visitor would see.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are definitely challenges ahead for making customization and, more importantly, ¬†just ensuring sites look good for users. I think that this is an area where other platforms -- like Medium and Squarespace, though in different ways -- are doing a good job.</p>
<h3>The first line of the Automattic creed</h3>
The <a href="http://ma.tt/2011/09/automattic-creed/">Automattic creed</a> states at the very beginning, "I will never stop learning." That was part of Matt's response when I asked just how they managed to <a href="http://dentedreality.com.au/2015/11/23/all-new-wordpress-com/">cross-train a workforce</a> that was primarily made of PHP developers to create a ¬†¬†world-class JavaScript driven application.
<p>Additionally to the natural desires that Automattic employees should have to learn, they created internal resources for helping people, and are considering releasing some of that material, maybe in the form of webinars or an online conference.</p>
<p>Matt said Automatticians will also be sharing what they learn at other conferences, like the upcoming <a href="https://feelingrestful.com/speakers/">A Day of REST</a>, where ¬†two Automatticians will be speaking.</p>
<p>Matt did admit that he hasn't made the PHP to JavaScript switch yet, and personally feels more comfortable in PHP; though some of his team have said it wasn't as intimidating as it sounds.</p>
<h3>Bug bounties</h3>
Did you know all Automattic properties are on <a href="https://hackerone.com/automattic">Hacker One</a> , the bug bounty community? If you find a security bug, you can get a bounty if you report it. I didn't know this until the Calypso launch.
<h3>How is Automattic thinking about revenue?</h3>
With my napkin math and a few small things I know about Automattic, I'd guesstimate they are somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million in annual revenue. I didn't even attempt to get confirmation of this, because I know they don't reveal this kind of information. So instead I wanted to get more insights of how Matt thinks about revenue at Automattic.
<p>Generally, he says ¬†they put their focus in, &quot;three main buckets.&quot; The use that focus both for revenue purposes and product purposes. Those areas are ¬†WordPress.com, Jetpack, and WooCommerce.</p>
<p>They group things like VaultPress and Akismet under Jetpack; so it's basically their WordPress.org SaaS revenue stream. Those are paid subscription products. ¬†They have been transitioning that offering, as Matt shared, &quot;a big trend over the past few years, has been to move away from a la carte upgrades, and have more bundles.&quot;</p>
<p>They've discovered that bundled plans of $100 per year and $300 ¬†per year have been successful. Here are those plans, for both WordPress.com and WordPress.org, as shown in the new WordPress.com/Calypso interface:</p>
<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wp-org-plan.png" alt="wp-org-plan" width="739" height="693" /><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wpcom-plan.png" alt="wpcom-plan" width="736" height="798" /></p>
<p>It appears they get most of their revenue from this stream. I do know, and have previously reported, that at least one point, WordPress.com VIP accounted for upwards of 25% of overally revenue, and though that gross number has gone up over the years, its percentage of overally revenue has gone down, meaning that these paid plans have outpaced VIP, growth-wise. I'd guess VIP revenue is now less than half of that 25% number now, but can't confirm it.</p>
<h3>Total sites,¬†¬†versus engagement</h3>
There are a lot of WordPress.com websites, but as ¬†Matt noted, it's a vanity metric due to the face that such a small percentage are active, from engaged users. So they are trying more to track engagement versus total blogs.
<p>I tried to get him to share the number of active websites, but that's not something he could share.</p>
<h3>Helping site owners monetize, and WooCommerce integration to WordPress.com</h3>
I talked about the roadmap some, and asked Matt about what they may offer in the future to help authors monetize their sites. They currently have a <a href="https://wordads.co/">WordAds</a> program, but that is a pageview driven strategy, and I'd love to see them introduce a way for authors to get paid via a tipjar, private paid posts, or subscription system like I've heard Medium is talking about. It's not on their current roadmap, but he says he'd be open to it.
<p>He also noted that since WooCommerce is now &quot;part of the family,&quot; that there may be future monetization opportunities ¬†¬†through that, though he said they don't have current plans for a hosted version of WordPress.com. I was honestly pretty surprised by this:</p>
<blockquote>In the beginning, our focus is really going to be on people hosting their ¬†¬†stores, you know, with ¬†web hosts. Because, part of the beauty of why WooCommerce is so popular is the flexibility, and I don't think the usability is there -- yet -- to be competitive with, like, a ¬†Shopify, or a BigCommerce. So, it's just a lot of work to do there.</blockquote>
[pullquote align="right"]Matt said he thinks of WooCommerce as how WordPress was around version 1.5. He called it, "very early days"[/pullquote], in that people are using it and see the potential, but knows, "there's just so much to work on and improve to make it accessible to a wider audience."
<p>He says the Woo team is now 63 people, and a number of Automatticians are doing &quot;Wootations&quot;, or rotations with the Woo team.</p>
<h3>What to expect next in the ¬†new WordPress.com interface</h3>
They are still working on a lot of things for the new interface. There are certain things that aren't there yet. For instance, showing and hiding your blogs you are personally attached to still requires the regular admin. I actually experienced this myself. Some parts of the interface are pretty circular and confusing.
<p>But they expect to do more going forward. They want to see what there is demand for, and what other people do with the open source nature of the project.</p>
<p>Matt also noted that he'd like to &quot;loop back&quot; to content blocks (code named <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/">CEUX</a>) -- the project that stalled last year. And he's like to see what can be done around collaboration, editing, and the suggestion process.</p>
<h3>Power and ease of use</h3>
One of the biggest challenges for WordPress is to continue to get easier to use, as other avenues for sharing information have gotten easier and easier, while continuing to enable powerful, feature rich implementations of WordPress.
<p>Matt thinks this balance is important, and that we must continue to improve in both directions to continue WordPress's growth.</p>
<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
I really enjoyed my first audio interview with Matt. He says we can expect more announcements around WordCamp US, which starts next week.
<p>The Calypso project is a fascinating one, and it's a great example of what we should continue to expect: powerful, catered tools ¬†that run on a RESTful API. They aren't always going to be tools for use everywhere, but we can expect to continue to see WordPress used in innovative ways, and be an exceptional platform for all kinds of applications.</p>
<p>And finally, at the end of the interview, I ¬†pitched Matt on one ¬†of my most hairbrained ideas. The naming conflict between WordPress.com and WordPress was really bad with this project, as nearly everyone not deeply embedded within the WordPress world got it wrong, and conflated Automattic's WordPress.com with WordPress the software.</p>
<p>And I think Jetpack's brand has really blossomed. I think there is an argument to be made that Automattic could change the name of WordPress.com to Jetpack, and both Automattic and WordPress would win from the change. It wouldn't be easy, but all I asked from him, is whether he'd read my post if I made one to give the pitch. He said he would, so expect that sometime soon.</p>
<p>Thanks to Matt for the interview, and thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/markarms">Mark Armstrong</a> for helping me get going with the new WordPress.com app and arranging the interview.</p>

<p>Furthermore, beyond the human curated content, much could be done in the future algorithmically. We didn't get as much into this stuff as I would've liked, but I think it's ¬†an enormous growth area for Automattic.</p>

<h3>How can the community anticipate ¬†the future, with ¬†more abstracted implementations of WordPress?</h3>
As WordPress projects continue to use REST APIs to create fully custom frontends, backends, and inbetweens, I was curious what Matt thinks the community can do to anticipate and educate users on how to deal with these scenarios, that may fragment WordPress and be confusing for people who expect WordPress plugins and code to interract well with one another.
<p>He doesn't think it's too much of a problem, but says it's important that we experiment and learn from our experiments; he was hesitant to call the potential for confusion fragmentation as much as experimentation.

Those are paid subscription products. ¬†They have been transitioning that offering, as Matt shared, &quot;a big trend over the past few years, has been to move away from a la carte upgrades, and have more bundles.&quot;</p>
<p>They've discovered that bundled plans of $100 per year and $300 ¬†per year have been successful. Here are those plans, for both WordPress.com and WordPress.org, as shown in the new WordPress.com/Calypso interface:</p>
<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wp-org-plan.png" alt="wp-org-plan" width="739" height="693" /><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wpcom-plan.png" alt="wpcom-plan" width="736" height="798" /></p>

<p>He says the Woo team is now 63 people, and a number of Automatticians are doing &quot;Wootations&quot;, or rotations with the Woo team.</p>
<h3>What to expect next in the ¬†new WordPress.com interface</h3>
They are still working on a lot of things for the new interface. There are certain things that aren't there yet. For instance, showing and hiding your blogs you are personally attached to still requires the regular admin. I actually experienced this myself. Some parts of the interface are pretty circular and confusing.
<p>But they expect to do more going forward. They want to see what there is demand for, and what other people do with the open source nature of the project.</p>
<p>Matt also noted that he'd like to &quot;loop back&quot; to content blocks (code named <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/">CEUX</a>) -- the project that stalled last year. And he's like to see what can be done around collaboration, editing, and the suggestion process.</p>
<h3>Power and ease of use</h3>
One of the biggest challenges for WordPress is to continue to get easier to use, as other avenues for sharing information have gotten easier and easier, while continuing to enable powerful, feature rich implementations of WordPress.
<p>Matt thinks this balance is important, and that we must continue to improve in both directions to continue WordPress's growth.</p>
<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
I really enjoyed my first audio interview with Matt. He says we can expect more announcements around WordCamp US, which starts next week.
<p>The Calypso project is a fascinating one, and it's a great example of what we should continue to expect: powerful, catered tools ¬†that run on a RESTful API. They aren't always going to be tools for use everywhere, but we can expect to continue to see WordPress used in innovative ways, and be an exceptional platform for all kinds of applications.</p>
<p>And finally, at the end of the interview, I ¬†pitched Matt on one ¬†of my most hairbrained ideas. The naming conflict between WordPress.com and WordPress was really bad with this project, as nearly everyone not deeply embedded within the WordPress world got it wrong, and conflated Automattic's WordPress.com with WordPress the software.</p>
<p>And I think Jetpack's brand has really blossomed. I think there is an argument to be made that Automattic could change the name of WordPress.com to Jetpack, and both Automattic and WordPress would win from the change. It wouldn't be easy, but all I asked from him, is whether he'd read my post if I made one to give the pitch. He said he would, so expect that sometime soon.</p>
<p>Thanks to Matt for the interview, and thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/markarms">Mark Armstrong</a> for helping me get going with the new WordPress.com app and arranging the interview.</p>

      <title>How StoryCorps uses WordPress to enable storytelling everywhere</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>StoryCorp is an organization that aims &quot;to provide people of all backgrounds and beliefs with the opportunity to record, share and preserve the stories of our lives.&quot; Featured stories are broadcast nationally on NPR.</p>
<p>StoryCorp has published more than 50,000 interviews with almost 100,000 participants since they launched in 2003. A small to mid-size non-profit organization, StoryCorp's interviews are logged in the Library of Congress, and over the years they have created new and ingenious ways to enable story telling.</p>
<p>There are recording booths in a number of cities throughout the country where anyone can go and record and interview or story. The first was in Grand Central Station, though it's since shut down due to budget issues. However, booths are open¬†in Atlanta, San Francisco, and Chicago where <a href="http://storycorps.org/programs/">anyone can make a reservation</a> to record.</p>
<p>They also have an Airstream trailer that travels the country and records interviews all over the place. Creating ways for people to share stories is the heart of StoryCorps mission.</p>

<p>One WordPress developer that worked on the StoryCorp project told me, &quot;I cry almost every time&quot; as they listen to StoryCorps on their¬†local NPR station every Friday morning. The stories to tend to be very powerful. I was nearly brought to tears by one where <a href="https://storycorps.me/interviews/i-just-hugged-the-man-who-murdered-my-son/">a lady hugs¬†her son's murderer</a>. Another moving story (from my hometown no less), features a father that <a href="http://storycorps.org/listen/william-watford-iii-and-deidra-robinson/">comes to terms with his daughter's homosexuality</a>. Or there's one where President Obama<a href="http://storycorps.org/listen/noah-mcqueen-and-barack-obama-150225/"> interviews a boy who overcame adversity to join My Brother's Keeper</a>.</p>
<h3>Record stories anywhere</h3>
The latest initiative for creating ways for people to share their story is via <a href="https://storycorps.me">StoryCorps.me</a>, a website and companion apps that make it easy for anyone with a smartphone to record an interview and publish it.
<p>StoryCorps.me is built on WordPress, and utilizes the <a title="The WordPress REST API" href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-json-rest-api/">WordPress REST API</a> to enable access to a customized content architecture. The StoryCorps app utilizes the API to consume data and publish stories from the app back to the website.</p>
<p>I interviewed Dean Haddock, Director of¬†Digital &amp; Technical¬†Innovation at StoryCorp, about how the idea for the app came about, how they use and think of WordPress, and other insights from their short three month development period.</p>
<h3>A national day of listening</h3>
Dean says he thinks the StoryCorps app really dates back to a program they ran three years ago called A National Day of Listening, where instead of shopping on Black Friday, they hosted an event where people could tell stories.
<p>Dean's team expanding on the idea, and the event turned <a href="http://diy.storycorps.org/">into a micro-site</a> using SoundCloud's API that made that process easier. That project¬†eventually expanded into the idea that would become StoryCorps.me.</p>
<h3>Funding for the app</h3>
The StoryCorps app was funded thanks to StoryCorps founder Dave Isay winning this year's TED Prize Winner. He gave a TED Talk in Vancouver just a few weeks ago, where he shared¬†how <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dave_isay_everyone_around_you_has_a_story_the_world_needs_to_hear?language=en">everyone has a story to tell</a>.
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_12145&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;752&quot;]<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dave_isay_everyone_around_you_has_a_story_the_world_needs_to_hear?language=en"><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/dave-isay-752x391.png" alt="Dave Isay at TED" width="752" height="391" /></a> Dave Isay at TED[/caption]</p>
<blockquote>The TED Prize is awarded to an individual with a creative, bold vision to spark global change. By leveraging the TED community‚Äôs resources and investing $1 million into a powerful idea, each year the TED Prize supports one wish to inspire the world.
<p><a href="https://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize">- TED Prize website</a></blockquote><br />
His wish after winning the TED Prize was to &quot;to grow this digital archive of the collective wisdom of humanity.&quot; During the TED Talk, he noted that StoryCorps is &quot;the single largest collection of human voices ever collected.&quot;</p>
<p>The new app makes this mission even¬†more plausible, by having almost no barrier for interview creation. The $1 million TED Prize made¬†it possible.</p>
<h3>Development of the StoryCorps app</h3>
<img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/storycorps-app-752x444.jpg" alt="storycorps-app" width="752" height="444" />
<p>With &quot;one tap&quot;, interviews can be created and uploaded to the StoryCorps.me website and the Library of Congress archive.</p>
<p>Dave shared some of his vision for the app during the TED Talk:</p>
<blockquote><span>Imagine, for example, a national homework assignment</span> <span>where every high school student studying U.S. history across the country</span> <span>records an interview with an elder over Thanksgiving,</span> <span>so that in one single weekend</span> <span>an entire generation of American lives and experiences are captured.</span></blockquote>
Development of the app was managed on three levels.
<p>The StoryCorps team did project management, communication, and handled RFPs for app and website development. They also ensured that everything fit the StoryCorps model, and ensured that the new website and app talked to existing StoryCorps software and APIs properly.</p>
<p><a href="http://10up.com">10up</a> built the website infrastructure, manages scalability issues, and managed the integration of the WordPress REST API.</p>
<p><a href="http://maya.com/news/maya-creates-storycorps-app-to-capture-the-wisdom-of-humanityreates-storycorps-app-to-capture-the-wisdom-of-humanity">MAYA design</a>¬†designed and built¬†the app for the end-user, utilizing PhoneGap so that the app could be launched simultaneously to both iOS and Android platforms.</p>
<p>[pullquote align=&quot;right&quot;]&quot;We knew we going to use WordPress before we started looking for partners to help us build this thing.&quot;[/pullquote] As a &quot;small to midsize non-profit,&quot; StoryCorps has few¬†resources. StoryCorps.org has been on WordPress, and they wanted to use WordPress for StoryCorps.me as well.</p>
<p>The development phase was quite short: from funding to launch took only three months. They launched at TED after receiving the funding last October.</p>
<blockquote>For public facing web technology, WordPress is so flexible and so malleable and amenable to whatever we need to do with it, that it really wasn't much of a question whether this was the right platform.</blockquote>
What their real question was, Dean shares, was how WordPress could scale if and when they hit a million users, and that's why they brought in 10up.
<h3>What they learned</h3>
They are really pleased with how the project has gone so far. However, not everything was a success. They had to pivot and make adjustments as they went along and learned new things and requirements.
<p>Dean noted, [pullquote align=&quot;right&quot;]&quot;You have to be willing to completely submit to the process.&quot;[/pullquote] He says it wouldn't have succeeded if 10up and Maya weren't committed as StoryCorps to the success of the project.</p>
<p>They also learned what Dean calls &quot;more tangible&quot; things, like the usage of PhoneGap. Without using a tool like PhoneGap, they wouldn't have been able to &quot;get to market as soon as possible.&quot; However, he admits the app could be slightly better if it were built in a native platform to either iOS or Android.</p>
<h3>Powerful stories</h3>
I really enjoyed digging into StoryCorps mission and the new <a href="https://storycorps.me">StoryCorps.me</a> project. I'm addicted to their stories, and some of the stories that have been uploaded -- such as <a href="https://storycorps.me/interviews/krisalyn-cut-her-hair/">those</a> <a href="https://storycorps.me/interviews/grandmas-favorite-memories/">in</a> the audio intro -- are really endearing.
<p>While there may be an element of noise to the StoryCorps.me archive, it's already evident that many gems will emerge, and who knows what ideas people will come up with for creative ways to perform interviews and record stories.</p>
<p>The apps are available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bottlerocketapps.storycorps">Google Play</a>¬†and in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/storycorps/id359071069?mt=8">App Store</a>. It'll be improving over the next weeks and and months. If you're excited about technology at StoryCorps, you can reach Dean at <a href="mailto:dhaddock@storycorps.org">dhaddock@storycorps.org</a> or you can also report issues or ask questions about the app at <a href="mailto:contactus@storycorps.me">contactus@storycorps.me</a>.</p>
<p>StoryCorps is¬†a great testament to WordPress and its ability to be an infrastructure to an app at scale, while also enabling efficient development cycles. This is probably my favorite utilization of the new REST API yet.</p>

<p>One WordPress developer that worked on the StoryCorp project told me, &quot;I cry almost every time&quot; as they listen to StoryCorps on their¬†local NPR station every Friday morning. The stories to tend to be very powerful. I was nearly brought to tears by one where <a href="https://storycorps.me/interviews/i-just-hugged-the-man-who-murdered-my-son/">a lady hugs¬†her son's murderer</a>. Another moving story (from my hometown no less), features a father that <a href="http://storycorps.org/listen/william-watford-iii-and-deidra-robinson/">comes to terms with his daughter's homosexuality</a>. Or there's one where President Obama<a href="http://storycorps.org/listen/noah-mcqueen-and-barack-obama-150225/"> interviews a boy who overcame adversity to join My Brother's Keeper</a>.</p>
<h3>Record stories anywhere</h3>
The latest initiative for creating ways for people to share their story is via <a href="https://storycorps.me">StoryCorps.me</a>, a website and companion apps that make it easy for anyone with a smartphone to record an interview and publish it.
<p>StoryCorps.me is built on WordPress, and utilizes the <a title="The WordPress REST API" href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-json-rest-api/">WordPress REST API</a> to enable access to a customized content architecture. The StoryCorps app utilizes the API to consume data and publish stories from the app back to the website.</p>
<p>I interviewed Dean Haddock, Director of¬†Digital &amp; Technical¬†Innovation at StoryCorp, about how the idea for the app came about, how they use and think of WordPress, and other insights from their short three month development period.</p>
<h3>A national day of listening</h3>
Dean says he thinks the StoryCorps app really dates back to a program they ran three years ago called A National Day of Listening, where instead of shopping on Black Friday, they hosted an event where people could tell stories.
<p>Dean's team expanding on the idea, and the event turned <a href="http://diy.storycorps.org/">into a micro-site</a> using SoundCloud's API that made that process easier. That project¬†eventually expanded into the idea that would become StoryCorps.me.</p>
<h3>Funding for the app</h3>
The StoryCorps app was funded thanks to StoryCorps founder Dave Isay winning this year's TED Prize Winner. He gave a TED Talk in Vancouver just a few weeks ago, where he shared¬†how <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dave_isay_everyone_around_you_has_a_story_the_world_needs_to_hear?language=en">everyone has a story to tell</a>.
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_12145&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;752&quot;]<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dave_isay_everyone_around_you_has_a_story_the_world_needs_to_hear?language=en"><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/dave-isay-752x391.png" alt="Dave Isay at TED" width="752" height="391" /></a> Dave Isay at TED[/caption]</p>
<blockquote>The TED Prize is awarded to an individual with a creative, bold vision to spark global change. By leveraging the TED community‚Äôs resources and investing $1 million into a powerful idea, each year the TED Prize supports one wish to inspire the world.
<p><a href="https://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize">- TED Prize website</a></blockquote><br />
His wish after winning the TED Prize was to &quot;to grow this digital archive of the collective wisdom of humanity.&quot; During the TED Talk, he noted that StoryCorps is &quot;the single largest collection of human voices ever collected.&quot;</p>
<p>The new app makes this mission even¬†more plausible, by having almost no barrier for interview creation. The $1 million TED Prize made¬†it possible.</p>
<h3>Development of the StoryCorps app</h3>
<img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/storycorps-app-752x444.jpg" alt="storycorps-app" width="752" height="444" />
<p>With &quot;one tap&quot;, interviews can be created and uploaded to the StoryCorps.me website and the Library of Congress archive.</p>
<p>Dave shared some of his vision for the app during the TED Talk:</p>
<blockquote><span>Imagine, for example, a national homework assignment</span> <span>where every high school student studying U.S. history across the country</span> <span>records an interview with an elder over Thanksgiving,</span> <span>so that in one single weekend</span> <span>an entire generation of American lives and experiences are captured.</span></blockquote>
Development of the app was managed on three levels.
<p>The StoryCorps team did project management, communication, and handled RFPs for app and website development. They also ensured that everything fit the StoryCorps model, and ensured that the new website and app talked to existing StoryCorps software and APIs properly.</p>
<p><a href="http://10up.com">10up</a> built the website infrastructure, manages scalability issues, and managed the integration of the WordPress REST API.</p>
<p><a href="http://maya.com/news/maya-creates-storycorps-app-to-capture-the-wisdom-of-humanityreates-storycorps-app-to-capture-the-wisdom-of-humanity">MAYA design</a>¬†designed and built¬†the app for the end-user, utilizing PhoneGap so that the app could be launched simultaneously to both iOS and Android platforms.</p>
<p>[pullquote align=&quot;right&quot;]&quot;We knew we going to use WordPress before we started looking for partners to help us build this thing.&quot;[/pullquote] As a &quot;small to midsize non-profit,&quot; StoryCorps has few¬†resources. StoryCorps.org has been on WordPress, and they wanted to use WordPress for StoryCorps.me as well.</p>
<p>The development phase was quite short: from funding to launch took only three months. They launched at TED after receiving the funding last October.</p>
<blockquote>For public facing web technology, WordPress is so flexible and so malleable and amenable to whatever we need to do with it, that it really wasn't much of a question whether this was the right platform.</blockquote>
What their real question was, Dean shares, was how WordPress could scale if and when they hit a million users, and that's why they brought in 10up.
<h3>What they learned</h3>
They are really pleased with how the project has gone so far. However, not everything was a success. They had to pivot and make adjustments as they went along and learned new things and requirements.
<p>Dean noted, [pullquote align=&quot;right&quot;]&quot;You have to be willing to completely submit to the process.&quot;[/pullquote] He says it wouldn't have succeeded if 10up and Maya weren't committed as StoryCorps to the success of the project.</p>
<p>They also learned what Dean calls &quot;more tangible&quot; things, like the usage of PhoneGap. Without using a tool like PhoneGap, they wouldn't have been able to &quot;get to market as soon as possible.&quot; However, he admits the app could be slightly better if it were built in a native platform to either iOS or Android.</p>
<h3>Powerful stories</h3>
I really enjoyed digging into StoryCorps mission and the new <a href="https://storycorps.me">StoryCorps.me</a> project. I'm addicted to their stories, and some of the stories that have been uploaded -- such as <a href="https://storycorps.me/interviews/krisalyn-cut-her-hair/">those</a> <a href="https://storycorps.me/interviews/grandmas-favorite-memories/">in</a> the audio intro -- are really endearing.
<p>While there may be an element of noise to the StoryCorps.me archive, it's already evident that many gems will emerge, and who knows what ideas people will come up with for creative ways to perform interviews and record stories.</p>
<p>The apps are available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bottlerocketapps.storycorps">Google Play</a>¬†and in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/storycorps/id359071069?mt=8">App Store</a>. It'll be improving over the next weeks and and months. If you're excited about technology at StoryCorps, you can reach Dean at <a href="mailto:dhaddock@storycorps.org">dhaddock@storycorps.org</a> or you can also report issues or ask questions about the app at <a href="mailto:contactus@storycorps.me">contactus@storycorps.me</a>.</p>
<p>StoryCorps is¬†a great testament to WordPress and its ability to be an infrastructure to an app at scale, while also enabling efficient development cycles. This is probably my favorite utilization of the new REST API yet.</p>

      <title>Running a successful membership site in real life, with Jonathan Williamson</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Jonathan Williamson is the co-founder and COO of <a href="http://cgcookie.com/">CGCookie</a>, a membership website¬†that provides as an educational resource for computer graphics and modeling. CGCookie has been around since 2008, and today is a network of five websites, has thousands of paying members, a team of six full time employees plus¬†a number of contractors.</p>
<p>CGCookie is built completely on WordPress and has a built in membership component. Some astute readers may recognize both the site and Jonathan's name; Jonathan is <a href="https://twitter.com/pippinsplugins">Pippin Williamson's</a>¬†identical twin brother, and Pippin has worked with Jonathan on¬†CGCookie many times. So, in this interview, you're not listening to me talk to Pippin -- though it sounds like it -- but I'm talking to Jonathan Williamson.</p>
<p>Jonathan is as passionate about CG, modeling, 3D printing, and the software that surrounds these disciplines as Pippin is about WordPress and programming. It was a pleasure to talk to Jonathan about what it's like to run a membership site that runs on WordPress. I think this interview will be beneficial for those that want to run a membership site, and also those that work with clients who make their living off of their website.</p>
<h3>How CGCookie evolved</h3>
CGCookie started as a blog with news, tutorials, and resources for CG enthusiasts. The first form of its monetization was by selling the source files for the various tutorials. Within about two years, Jonathan and co-founder Wes Burke decided to add a membership component¬†that ended up working far better than they anticipated.
<p>Jonathan has been working full-time on CGCookie since around the summer of 2009. They originally launched on aMember, before eventually migrating to Pippin's <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/restrict-content-pro-premium-content-plugin/">Restrict Content Pro</a> plugin, along with <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/">Easy Digital Downloads</a>.</p>
<p>Today, CGCookie has more than 120,000 free users, and they have around 4,700 paid members.</p>
<p>Since 2008, CGCookie have¬†managed to not have a full time web developer until February of 2014, when they hired Nick Haskins. You may recognize Nick as the founder of <a title="Aesop, a Medium-esque ‚Äústory engine‚Äù for WordPress" href="https://poststatus.com/aesop-medium-esque-story-engine-wordpress/">Aesop Stories</a> as well. Nick manages front-end development for the site, and they still don't have a backend developer -- though a backend developer and designer are on their roadmap.</p>
<h3>How CGCookie's eCommerce setup runs</h3>
Considering Jonathan is¬†using¬†his brother's own plugins in the real world, it makes for a great avenue for feedback and insight for Pippin to improve those products.
<p>CGCookie is using Restrict Content Pro for <a href="https://cgcookie.com/membership/">memberships</a> themselves, and EDD for their <a href="https://cgcookie.com/shop/">store</a>. We talked about whether EDD could be used for both, or if there is room for improvement in the marriage between the two systems, and he believes there is and that it's a goal for the two plugins. For instance,¬†currently, reporting and user management and a number of other features are independent between each plugin even though often times the users that utilize the system may overlap.</p>
<p>I asked Jonathan about scaling WordPress and eCommerce for their large user base. He says that scaling for eCommerce has not been difficult, but with over a hundred thousand users, some default WordPress functionality has not scaled well; for instance, some admin areas create dropdowns for all users, which does not work well. Fortunately, there are some trac tickets in place currently to help solve some of these problems.</p>
<h3>Prioritizing goals for a membership site</h3>
When discussing challenges running a membership site, Jonathan highlights the internal battles: balancing new features versus iterative improvements. Based on my short experience managing¬†this membership site, I completely agree.
<p>For an example, Jonathan told me about a potential question and answer system to help his members get answers for specific technical topics that may be beyond the scope of a specific course. They believe a Stack Exchange style setup that allows them to refer their courses to specific questions would allow them to better serve their customers with the same content they already have.</p>
<blockquote>How do you get people to find your content that answers their question, but you don't have¬†a way of just explicitly saying that these are the questions this course answers?</blockquote>
They're considering a method of post to post relationships that direct courses as question answers and vice versa. For this feature and others, they try to do things with a short return on investment, but they also don't want to be a slave to it. They sometimes¬†do things "that are important to the quality of CGCookie, that never make a dime." They removed ads last year under that very premise, to make CGCookie a better learning experience.
<h3>Not the only place to learn</h3>
Jonathan knows CGCookie isn't the only place to learn, so they focus on creating an excellent community and learning experience for their customers.
<p>Realizing that our sites aren't the only way to get certain information is an important thing to know to be able to better focus what we create for our users and why we create it.</p>
<h3>Pricing for CGCookie</h3>
CGCookie has pricing for monthly, quarterly, or yearly pricing; all plans renew automatically unless explicitly cancelled. This is a feature they actively A/B test to see what's working and what's not.
<p>Behavior of customers varies between the three levels. Jonathan says that the users are more invested in their purchases (and getting more out of it) when they sign up for longer.¬†Quarterly members have 10% longer lifetime memberships and spend three times longer on the site.</p>
<p>However, they do have &quot;a fair bit&quot; of what I called &quot;download and dash&quot; members that sign up for a month, download a bunch of assets and cancel. Monthly memberships are also the most popular plan. They've considered locking down downloads for monthly signups but it's not something they want to do unless it becomes a bigger problem; however they do lose money on those customers that download gigabytes of files and videos but¬†only stay subscribed for one month.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
During A/B tests, they have found that people will be just as likely to sign up for quarterly as monthly if monthly isn't available, and quarterly members are more engaged. One thing they noted is that once people stick around for a few months, the average tenure of a user skyrockets; they have some users that have been a paying member as long as the site has been running.
<p>One of my big takeaways talking to Jonathan was about how significant testing can be. Their tests help them decide on the¬†optimal pricing and payment plans to maximize a lifetime value.</p>
<p>For testing, insights, and statistics they use both <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/">Optimizely</a>, <a href="https://mixpanel.com/">Mixpanel</a>, and Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Mixpanel allows you to create custom events in your software, and does require some code knowledge, but it can deliver valuable insights if you use it correctly.¬†Jonathan notes, &quot;It's basically as comprehensive as you make it.&quot;</p>
<p>They can also mesh tools. They can track which A/B test from Optimizely a customer signed up with, and then use Mixpanel to track what they did and how they did it. They can get login metrics, renewal numbers, and more for each plan and signup flow.</p>
<p>Mixpanel requires PHP and JavaScript knowledge to utilize, but Optimizely has an extensive visual interface that doesn't require code knowledge to utilize.</p>
<h3>What encourages membership signups</h3>
"It varies day to day, week to week, month to month," in regard to how their signups work. A bad month in the economy can make their signups go down. Sometimes quarterly users will spike while monthly users are steady.
<p>Their biggest thing that affects signup rates is customer support. Some presale, but also support for new members to help answer questions and get people engaged. [pullquote align=&quot;right&quot;]When they can help someone answer the question, &quot;Where do I go next?&quot;, they are able to keep them for a long time.[/pullquote]</p>
<p>They have one or two courses that drive a ton of traffic to their site, and it is therefore their largest onboarding channel for new members. However, they don't have a silver bullet for what it takes to get new users. They are always trying new things.</p>
<h3>On competing and the industry</h3>
Jonathan doesn't see themselves as a part of a singular industry. While many think of CG as a part of the film industry, it's one of dozens of potential applications, and they don't want to narrow themselves to a particular one.
<p>They also poll users to get a feel for who they are and what industry actual users come from. Based on around a thousand responses, they had no real pattern at all. The results were all over the board.</p>
<p>So they don't want to compete with a film tutorials site or any other industry site. They want to focus on the tool itself. They want to teach people how to use Blender and show them how it can be applied to various industries their users are a part of.</p>
<h3>Advice for those running membership sites</h3>
<blockquote>"Build your community would be the main one. It's one thing to offer a really good product. It's one thing to¬†build a really good website. But if you don't have the¬†community behind you that's going to be willing to trust in you with their wallet ... it's not going to go anywhere long term, sustainably."</blockquote>
Jonathan says it's about building the community as well as the sense of trust within that community. He believes that customers will want to know that not only the content will be worth it, but that it will continue to be worth it -- and that the communication and support from the team behind the site will be consistent as well.
<p>He believes that subscriptions and products are very different. With a subscription, the interaction is just as or far more important than specific content itself.</p>
<p>When he refers to community, he doesn't mean it has to be strictly through something like a forum. He considers it a broad term, and for them it evolved out of their Blender community user base. At the time we recorded this, they didn't have forums, a dedicated chat system, or an actual community integration part. But the community exists and thrives within comments and their gallery functionality.</p>
<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
Jonathan is full of great advice and I could listen to him talk about membership sites for a long time. I have no experience with CG but at the end of this interview he had me wanted to go build something with Blender.
<p>You can (and should) keep up with <a href="https://twitter.com/carter2422">Jonathan on Twitter</a>, or perhaps you'll see him at a conference near you -- but you'll probably think it's Pippin at first. Also be sure to checkout <a href="http://cgcookie.com/">CGCookie's website</a>; it's really great.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jonathan Williamson is the co-founder and COO of <a href="http://cgcookie.com/">CGCookie</a>, a membership website¬†that provides as an educational resource for computer graphics and modeling. CGCookie has been around since 2008, and today is a network of five websites, has thousands of paying members, a team of six full time employees plus¬†a number of contractors.</p>
<p>CGCookie is built completely on WordPress and has a built in membership component. Some astute readers may recognize both the site and Jonathan's name; Jonathan is <a href="https://twitter.com/pippinsplugins">Pippin Williamson's</a>¬†identical twin brother, and Pippin has worked with Jonathan on¬†CGCookie many times. So, in this interview, you're not listening to me talk to Pippin -- though it sounds like it -- but I'm talking to Jonathan Williamson.</p>
<p>Jonathan is as passionate about CG, modeling, 3D printing, and the software that surrounds these disciplines as Pippin is about WordPress and programming. It was a pleasure to talk to Jonathan about what it's like to run a membership site that runs on WordPress. I think this interview will be beneficial for those that want to run a membership site, and also those that work with clients who make their living off of their website.</p>
<h3>How CGCookie evolved</h3>
CGCookie started as a blog with news, tutorials, and resources for CG enthusiasts. The first form of its monetization was by selling the source files for the various tutorials. Within about two years, Jonathan and co-founder Wes Burke decided to add a membership component¬†that ended up working far better than they anticipated.
<p>Jonathan has been working full-time on CGCookie since around the summer of 2009. They originally launched on aMember, before eventually migrating to Pippin's <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/restrict-content-pro-premium-content-plugin/">Restrict Content Pro</a> plugin, along with <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/">Easy Digital Downloads</a>.</p>
<p>Today, CGCookie has more than 120,000 free users, and they have around 4,700 paid members.</p>
<p>Since 2008, CGCookie have¬†managed to not have a full time web developer until February of 2014, when they hired Nick Haskins. You may recognize Nick as the founder of <a title="Aesop, a Medium-esque ‚Äústory engine‚Äù for WordPress" href="https://poststatus.com/aesop-medium-esque-story-engine-wordpress/">Aesop Stories</a> as well. Nick manages front-end development for the site, and they still don't have a backend developer -- though a backend developer and designer are on their roadmap.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/wc-nyc-752x272.jpg" alt="wc-nyc" />Last week, I was in New York City for WordCamp and some client meetings. The event was a huge success, with four full tracks of expert designers, developers, and WordPress professionals sharing what they‚Äôve learned.</p>
<p>I had a great time with everyone there. I saw old friends, and met new friends.</p>
<p>I had my recording equipment with me, and I asked a question to some folks there: how has WordPress changed your life?</p>
<p>Here are their answers:</p>

<p>I‚Äôd like to thank the organizers for their efforts, the sponsors for their investment in the WordPress community, the speakers for their wisdom, and the attendees for their hunger to learn and connect with like-minded individuals.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôve never attended a WordCamp ‚Äî especially one outside of your own city ‚Äî I highly encourage you do. They are so fun. There are a number of events coming up that I‚Äôll be at as well, so I hope you‚Äôll say hi there: <a href="http://wpyall.com">WordCamp Birmingham</a> (August 16th), <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-community-summit-back/" title="The WordPress community summit is back">WordCamp San Francisco</a> (October 25-26th), and <a href="https://poststatus.com/pressnomics-3-dates/">PressNomics</a> (January 22nd-24th).</p>

<p>I‚Äôd like to thank the organizers for their efforts, the sponsors for their investment in the WordPress community, the speakers for their wisdom, and the attendees for their hunger to learn and connect with like-minded individuals.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôve never attended a WordCamp ‚Äî especially one outside of your own city ‚Äî I highly encourage you do. They are so fun. There are a number of events coming up that I‚Äôll be at as well, so I hope you‚Äôll say hi there: <a href="http://wpyall.com">WordCamp Birmingham</a> (August 16th), <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-community-summit-back/" title="The WordPress community summit is back">WordCamp San Francisco</a> (October 25-26th), and <a href="https://poststatus.com/pressnomics-3-dates/">PressNomics</a> (January 22nd-24th).</p>

      <title>Interview with Chris Lema: a journey to working full time with WordPress</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/chrislema-752x367.jpg" alt="chrislema" /></p>
<p>On May 28th, 2012, I was virtually introduced to Chris Lema. He had 653 Twitter followers at the time. I know so, because that‚Äôs how we were introduced ‚Äî through an email from Twitter telling me he was now following me. At the time, he‚Äôd not even started <a href="http://chrislema.com">daily writing on his personal blog</a>; he didn‚Äôt start that until September of that year.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs hard to imagine a time where I didn‚Äôt know who Chris Lema was, or a time where I wasn‚Äôt learning from him. Today, Chris is¬†a significant voice in the WordPress world. He was just announced, deservedly so, in the <a href="http://2014.sf.wordcamp.org/2014/08/04/say-hello-to-the-first-group-of-wordcamp-san-francisco-speakers/">first batch of¬†speakers</a> for WordCamp San Francisco.</p>
<p>He‚Äôs been blogging nearly every day for two years. I‚Äôve met him at a number of events. We‚Äôve shared meals together. We‚Äôve had phone calls where Chris gave me advice for¬†my career and life. We even spent a week in Cape Town, South Africa traveling together for a WordCamp <a href="https://poststatus.com/blogging-kickstarted-career/" title="Let‚Äôs learn in Cape Town">that I won‚Äôt forget</a>.</p>
<p>Chris Lema is my friend, and a mentor. I owe him a tremendous amount for his advice, his continuous generosity, and his kindness toward me. And I also know I can‚Äôt pay him back; giving to others is his passion, and I‚Äôll never be able match that in return.</p>
<p>What I know I can do is pay it forward. As I gain knowledge, and maybe even a shred of my own wisdom, I can pay forward that mentorship to others that are up and coming in their careers, and be to them as Chris has been to me and as others have been to Chris.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm one of many, many people that feel this way about Chris. He now has 6,500 followers on Twitter ‚Äî something I note purely as a way to compare to the beginning of this post, and highlight how many people he‚Äôs impacted in such a short time. He‚Äôs also a direct mentor to dozens of people¬†who make their living with WordPress.</p>
<h3>What if Chris did WordPress full time?</h3>
<p>Incredibly, Chris has had this influence and impact on the WordPress community without having a full time WordPress job.</p>
<p>For eight years, he‚Äôs been at Emphasys Software ‚Äî a successful company, but not one you‚Äôd know of in the WordPress ecosystem ‚Äî and he‚Äôs been coaching WordPress companies and blogging in his spare time.</p>
<p>It makes you wonder, what would he do if his full time job were WordPress-centric? I certainly have thought so. And as Chris notes in our interview, I asked him this question while we were in Cape Town.</p>
<p>I wanted to see¬†what would happen with¬†Chris full time in¬†the WordPress world, and now we‚Äôre about to find out.</p>
<h3>Joining Crowd Favorite as CTO</h3>
<p><a href="http://chrislema.com/wordpress-change-your-life/">Chris is announcing today</a> that he‚Äôs <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/blog/2014/08/crowd-favorite-welcomes-chris-lema/">joining Crowd Favorite</a> full time as its new Chief Technical Officer.</p>
<p>Chris was already on the board of the¬†VeloMedia Group, which has utilized¬†the Crowd Favorite brand <a href="https://poststatus.com/crowd-favorite-acquired-velomedia/" title="Crowd Favorite to be acquired by VeloMedia">since its acquisition of the company late last year</a>.</p>
<p>CEO Karim Marucchi has wanted Chris to be a full time part of the¬†VeloMedia group for some time as well. But the logistics weren‚Äôt easy to work out. However, in the last month or so they really pushed to make it happen, and now Chris will be the CTO as well as a chief strategist for Crowd Favorite and other companies within the VeloMedia group.</p>
<p>Chris will focus heavily on reaching out to the enterprise space, via consulting opportunities and a variety of other concepts they are working on.</p>
<h3>Hear about Chris‚Äô journey to full time WordPress</h3>
<p>In this interview, Chris and I talk about his journey to working full time with WordPress. We talk about his career,¬†his entry into blogging and the WordPress community, about the structure of¬†Crowd Favorite, and the WordPress economy in general.</p>

      <title>Chris Coyier on WordPress, business, and building the web</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/chris-coyier-752x406.jpg" alt="chris-coyier" />Chris Coyier is not a stranger to most of us web workers. He‚Äôs a¬†designer at <a href="http://codepen.io" title="CodePen">CodePen</a>, a writer at <a href="http://css-tricks.com" title="CSS-Tricks">CSS-Tricks</a>, and a podcaster at <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com" title="ShopTalk Podcast">ShopTalk</a>.</p>
<p>He uses WordPress on all three of his primary projects. For years, Chris has been a consistent advocate for the platform. He develops¬†his own websites with WordPress, but his day-to-day interactions are as a user.</p>
<p>Chris brings a unique perspective, I believe. He did some client work early in his career, but¬†he‚Äôs been more¬†involved in SaaS projects and membership websites; his current membership¬†websites¬†are on WordPress (CSS-Tricks) and Ruby on Rails (CodePen).</p>
<p>I asked Chris about his projects, his perspective on various aspects of WordPress, and the¬†community around it. I enjoyed learning from him, and I hope you do too:</p>
<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/PostStatus/DraftPodcast/chris-coyier-post-status-draft.mp3">http://s3.amazonaws.com/PostStatus/DraftPodcast/chris-coyier-post-status-draft.mp3</a></p>
<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/PostStatus/DraftPodcast/chris-coyier-post-status-draft.mp3">Direct Download</a></p>
<h3>What have you learned from working on membership websites?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>¬†It‚Äôs just a good dang business idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris was sold on the idea of membership websites from his tenure at <a href="http://www.wufoo.com/" title="Wufoo">Wufoo</a>¬†and <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/" title="SurveyMonkey">SurveyMonkey</a>¬†(where he worked once they acquired Wufoo).</p>
<p>He uses Pippin Williamson‚Äôs <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/restrict-content-pro-premium-content-plugin/">Restrict Content Pro</a> for managing <a href="http://css-tricks.com/lodge/" title="The Lodge">The Lodge</a> on CSS-Tricks. At CodePen, they spend time thinking about pricing, churn, and other membership metrics.</p>
<p>They talk about some of these things (and much more) on the <a href="http://blog.codepen.io/radio/" title="CodePen Radio">CodePen Radio</a> podcast ‚Äî an awesome podcast for anyone interested in SaaS, not just CodePen.</p>
<h4>Delivering value</h4>
<p>Another aspect Chris noted about membership websites is how it makes you want to continually deliver value for customers. He always wants to make people feel like they‚Äôre getting excellent features and value for the price of their membership.</p>
<p>Another thing he and the CodePen team are learning is prioritizing feature requests. When you are building for members, you want to build features members want; and sometimes that goes against other fixes that are less glamorous. So they are consistently trying to balance time spent on customer-facing features versus behind the scenes development.</p>
<h4>Build the feature, get the reward</h4>
<p>Chris talked about how important it is for him to build something, then be rewarded for the work he does, versus selling something and then having to build the feature for it.</p>
<p>He experience this with his big <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chriscoyier/screencasting-a-complete-redesign">Kickstarter</a> project for a CSS-Tricks redesign a couple of years ago, and said that mentality was really difficult for him.</p>
<h3>What do you appreciate more now about WordPress, after using other software?</h3>
<p>WordPress comes with a lot of built-in features that many of us (I do at least) may take for granted. Need a user system? Check. Need comments? Check. Need categorization? Check.</p>
<p>Building CodePen, Chris¬†is¬†able to appreciate (even more than before) just how powerful WordPress is and how much thought goes into every feature.</p>
<p>We dove into something seemingly simple as an example: tags. It turns out that something even that simple takes a lot of thought, consideration, and user experience considerations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What it ends up as, is something you‚Äôll have to iterate on for years to get anywhere close to how good the WordPress one works already. And that‚Äôs like the tiniest thing we could think about. Think about the login system, or something else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So his advice was to focus on simplicity and decisions when building features, because required effort grows rapidly as a feature gets more complicated.</p>
<h3>How would you compare the WordPress community to other web communities?</h3>
<p>Chris has exposure to a much broader web community than I do. I‚Äôm pretty locked into the WordPress bubble. He sees the Ruby on Rails world, the more generic web world, and attends and speaks at a slew of non-WordPress conferences every year.</p>
<p>Even though he says he‚Äôs mostly in a WordPress bubble himself (he‚Äôs not exactly attending Drupal conferences, he notes), he thinks that the WordPress community is pretty top-notch, and hasn‚Äôt seen other communities that are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than the WordPress community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There‚Äôs definitely no other CMS that I‚Äôm jealous of that community.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What questions about WordPress are you always seeing on the ShopTalk Podcast</h3>
<p>Chris and his co-host Dave Rupert (seriously, <a href="https://twitter.com/davatron5000">follow Dave</a> and gain laughs¬†and knowledge in life) get a lot of questions about WordPress on the ShopTalk Podcast. Some of these questions are repeated pretty frequently, and they see trends of common issues.</p>
<h4>Working locally and syncing remotely</h4>
<p>For WordPress, the most common questions tend to come around syncing the local development environment with the live environment. They‚Äôve been recommending <a href="https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/" title="WP Migrate DB Pro">WP Migrate DB Pro</a> for people trying to get around that, though Chris says he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs perfect for huge websites like CSS-Tricks.</p>
<p>I think, to a degree, the common confusion is logical. WordPress development is really centered around three different layers of ‚Äústuff‚Äù: the content (posts, pages, etc), the files in the directory, and the site management database options. I think there is plenty of room for confusion when it‚Äôs not easy to decouple website management with website content, from a database perspective.</p>
<h4>Learning more about WordPress through the lens of a different audience</h4>
<p>I used this segment to talk about other confusing aspects of WordPress. We talked about database management, the degree of PHP knowledge required for WordPress theming, using pre-processors in distributed versus custom themes, responsive images, and the asset-itis of many WordPress websites that utilize plugins that each load their own scripts and styles.</p>
<p>Regardless of the specific issues people are having, I find tremendous value listening to ShopTalk ‚Äî which is not as hardcore of a WordPress audience as I have here ‚Äî where the trends of people‚Äôs struggles help reveal real struggles that perhaps we could build better tools for in WordPress.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also worth noting that some of the ‚Äústruggles‚Äù we talked about are very modern struggles, and WordPress has been around for over eleven years. WordPress iterates pretty quickly and does a great job of supporting modern web features, but it‚Äôs rarely immediate, especially in terms of core support. But plugin support and the shear number of people innovating on top of WordPress is significant and awesome.</p>
<h3>Just build websites!</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>So many people want to be told what to do and what to learn next. That‚Äôs for sure the #1 question on ShopTalk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the face of lots of new and changing technology, Chris is often asked about what to do first, or what to do next. He and Dave have a core <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/mantra/">mantra at ShopTalk</a> to encourage people to ‚Äújust build websites!‚Äù</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The things that you learn will happen as a result of building those websites and things for other people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The degree of paralysis by analysis they see is significant, and Chris and Dave hope that people will let their experiences guide¬†them versus a to-do list of things they must learn today.</p>
<h4>You‚Äôre desirable</h4>
<p>Another note is that pretty much everyone has something they can do to provide value to others. People surely know something from a tooling perspective that‚Äôs worthwhile; even sans-modern tools, basic knowledge of HTML and CSS ‚Äî the building blocks of the web ‚Äî could be a great asset to lots of business.</p>
<p>Even more important than tooling though, is the ability to solve problems. Chris used an example of a business that sells wrenches. If you can help a business that sells wrenches to sell more wrenches, then you are able to provide that business a lot of value; so focus on helping businesses do what they do better.</p>
<h4>Learn by sharing</h4>
<p>I admire Chris‚Äô degree of sharing what he‚Äôs learning, through ShopTalk, CodePen Radio, and for years on CSS-Tricks.</p>
<p>He doesn‚Äôt do anything special to write about what he learns. He keeps his drafts right there in WordPress. He doesn‚Äôt take special notes. He just writes, and he often writes about what he‚Äôs learning.</p>
<p>Over time he‚Äôs been able to refine his writing and learn what to expect, as far as feedback goes. But at the core he just writes, and through that writing he‚Äôs been able to grow his own audience and get better at everything else he‚Äôs doing professionally.</p>
<h3>Staying consistent and avoiding burnout</h3>
<p>I was curious what Chris has done to stay so consistent online and avoid burnout. It seems to me that a lot of people get temporarily motivated and quickly disenchanted.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve learned in my own experience with the web that any measure of success takes lots and lots of consistent effort. Chris hasn‚Äôt done a lot to think about avoiding burnout, but figures there are some things he subconsciously¬†does to stay motivated.</p>
<p>That may be taking extended breaks from the web and disconnecting for a trip to the woods, or shorter breaks just in the day like stopping and playing the banjo for a few minutes.</p>
<h3>Stay in touch with Chris</h3>
<p>At the end of every episode of ShopTalk, Chris and Dave give guests an opportunity to plug whatever they want.</p>
<p>Chris‚Äô plug for our interview was to advise folks to take some time off from building their own product and instead go into their issues list and clean up after themselves and their project ‚Äî which is what Chris and team are doing at CodePen right now.</p>
<p>He also noted that nothing would make him happier than folks going <a href="http://codepen.io/pro">Pro on CodePen</a>. If you teach, interact with others, or want a way to store private pens, you should definitely check it out. And it‚Äôs affordable too, at only $75 for the year.</p>
<p>While he didn‚Äôt take the opportunity to plug¬†much of¬†his own stuff, you should definitely still check out his various projects. I‚Äôve learned a ton from Chris since I started my own journey on the web. If my learning journey on the web were a university, I‚Äôve definitely taken multiple classes from CSS-Tricks and the ShopTalk Show. Chris‚Äô business is built on a three-legged stool right now. Check them out:</p>

<li><a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a> ‚Äì a playground for the front-end side of the web.</li>
<li><a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">ShopTalk Show</a> ‚Äì a podcast about front-end web design (and sound effects).</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/chris-coyier-752x406.jpg" alt="chris-coyier" />Chris Coyier is not a stranger to most of us web workers. He‚Äôs a¬†designer at <a href="http://codepen.io" title="CodePen">CodePen</a>, a writer at <a href="http://css-tricks.com" title="CSS-Tricks">CSS-Tricks</a>, and a podcaster at <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com" title="ShopTalk Podcast">ShopTalk</a>.</p>
<p>He uses WordPress on all three of his primary projects. For years, Chris has been a consistent advocate for the platform. He develops¬†his own websites with WordPress, but his day-to-day interactions are as a user.</p>
<p>Chris brings a unique perspective, I believe. He did some client work early in his career, but¬†he‚Äôs been more¬†involved in SaaS projects and membership websites; his current membership¬†websites¬†are on WordPress (CSS-Tricks) and Ruby on Rails (CodePen).</p>
<p>I asked Chris about his projects, his perspective on various aspects of WordPress, and the¬†community around it. I enjoyed learning from him, and I hope you do too:</p>
<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/PostStatus/DraftPodcast/chris-coyier-post-status-draft.mp3">http://s3.amazonaws.com/PostStatus/DraftPodcast/chris-coyier-post-status-draft.mp3</a></p>
<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/PostStatus/DraftPodcast/chris-coyier-post-status-draft.mp3">Direct Download</a></p>
<h3>What have you learned from working on membership websites?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>¬†It‚Äôs just a good dang business idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chris was sold on the idea of membership websites from his tenure at <a href="http://www.wufoo.com/" title="Wufoo">Wufoo</a>¬†and <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/" title="SurveyMonkey">SurveyMonkey</a>¬†(where he worked once they acquired Wufoo).</p>
<p>He uses Pippin Williamson‚Äôs <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/restrict-content-pro-premium-content-plugin/">Restrict Content Pro</a> for managing <a href="http://css-tricks.com/lodge/" title="The Lodge">The Lodge</a> on CSS-Tricks. At CodePen, they spend time thinking about pricing, churn, and other membership metrics.</p>
<p>They talk about some of these things (and much more) on the <a href="http://blog.codepen.io/radio/" title="CodePen Radio">CodePen Radio</a> podcast ‚Äî an awesome podcast for anyone interested in SaaS, not just CodePen.</p>
<h4>Delivering value</h4>
<p>Another aspect Chris noted about membership websites is how it makes you want to continually deliver value for customers. He always wants to make people feel like they‚Äôre getting excellent features and value for the price of their membership.</p>
<p>Another thing he and the CodePen team are learning is prioritizing feature requests. When you are building for members, you want to build features members want; and sometimes that goes against other fixes that are less glamorous. So they are consistently trying to balance time spent on customer-facing features versus behind the scenes development.</p>
<h4>Build the feature, get the reward</h4>
<p>Chris talked about how important it is for him to build something, then be rewarded for the work he does, versus selling something and then having to build the feature for it.</p>
<p>He experience this with his big <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chriscoyier/screencasting-a-complete-redesign">Kickstarter</a> project for a CSS-Tricks redesign a couple of years ago, and said that mentality was really difficult for him.</p>
<h3>What do you appreciate more now about WordPress, after using other software?</h3>
<p>WordPress comes with a lot of built-in features that many of us (I do at least) may take for granted. Need a user system? Check. Need comments? Check. Need categorization? Check.</p>
<p>Building CodePen, Chris¬†is¬†able to appreciate (even more than before) just how powerful WordPress is and how much thought goes into every feature.</p>
<p>We dove into something seemingly simple as an example: tags. It turns out that something even that simple takes a lot of thought, consideration, and user experience considerations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What it ends up as, is something you‚Äôll have to iterate on for years to get anywhere close to how good the WordPress one works already. And that‚Äôs like the tiniest thing we could think about. Think about the login system, or something else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So his advice was to focus on simplicity and decisions when building features, because required effort grows rapidly as a feature gets more complicated.</p>
<h3>How would you compare the WordPress community to other web communities?</h3>
<p>Chris has exposure to a much broader web community than I do. I‚Äôm pretty locked into the WordPress bubble. He sees the Ruby on Rails world, the more generic web world, and attends and speaks at a slew of non-WordPress conferences every year.</p>
<p>Even though he says he‚Äôs mostly in a WordPress bubble himself (he‚Äôs not exactly attending Drupal conferences, he notes), he thinks that the WordPress community is pretty top-notch, and hasn‚Äôt seen other communities that are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than the WordPress community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There‚Äôs definitely no other CMS that I‚Äôm jealous of that community.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What questions about WordPress are you always seeing on the ShopTalk Podcast</h3>
<p>Chris and his co-host Dave Rupert (seriously, <a href="https://twitter.com/davatron5000">follow Dave</a> and gain laughs¬†and knowledge in life) get a lot of questions about WordPress on the ShopTalk Podcast. Some of these questions are repeated pretty frequently, and they see trends of common issues.</p>
<h4>Working locally and syncing remotely</h4>
<p>For WordPress, the most common questions tend to come around syncing the local development environment with the live environment. They‚Äôve been recommending <a href="https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/" title="WP Migrate DB Pro">WP Migrate DB Pro</a> for people trying to get around that, though Chris says he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs perfect for huge websites like CSS-Tricks.</p>
<p>I think, to a degree, the common confusion is logical. WordPress development is really centered around three different layers of ‚Äústuff‚Äù: the content (posts, pages, etc), the files in the directory, and the site management database options. I think there is plenty of room for confusion when it‚Äôs not easy to decouple website management with website content, from a database perspective.</p>
<h4>Learning more about WordPress through the lens of a different audience</h4>
<p>I used this segment to talk about other confusing aspects of WordPress. We talked about database management, the degree of PHP knowledge required for WordPress theming, using pre-processors in distributed versus custom themes, responsive images, and the asset-itis of many WordPress websites that utilize plugins that each load their own scripts and styles.</p>
<p>Regardless of the specific issues people are having, I find tremendous value listening to ShopTalk ‚Äî which is not as hardcore of a WordPress audience as I have here ‚Äî where the trends of people‚Äôs struggles help reveal real struggles that perhaps we could build better tools for in WordPress.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also worth noting that some of the ‚Äústruggles‚Äù we talked about are very modern struggles, and WordPress has been around for over eleven years. WordPress iterates pretty quickly and does a great job of supporting modern web features, but it‚Äôs rarely immediate, especially in terms of core support. But plugin support and the shear number of people innovating on top of WordPress is significant and awesome.</p>
<h3>Just build websites!</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>So many people want to be told what to do and what to learn next. That‚Äôs for sure the #1 question on ShopTalk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the face of lots of new and changing technology, Chris is often asked about what to do first, or what to do next. He and Dave have a core <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/mantra/">mantra at ShopTalk</a> to encourage people to ‚Äújust build websites!‚Äù</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The things that you learn will happen as a result of building those websites and things for other people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The degree of paralysis by analysis they see is significant, and Chris and Dave hope that people will let their experiences guide¬†them versus a to-do list of things they must learn today.</p>
<h4>You‚Äôre desirable</h4>
<p>Another note is that pretty much everyone has something they can do to provide value to others. People surely know something from a tooling perspective that‚Äôs worthwhile; even sans-modern tools, basic knowledge of HTML and CSS ‚Äî the building blocks of the web ‚Äî could be a great asset to lots of business.</p>
<p>Even more important than tooling though, is the ability to solve problems. Chris used an example of a business that sells wrenches. If you can help a business that sells wrenches to sell more wrenches, then you are able to provide that business a lot of value; so focus on helping businesses do what they do better.</p>
<h4>Learn by sharing</h4>
<p>I admire Chris‚Äô degree of sharing what he‚Äôs learning, through ShopTalk, CodePen Radio, and for years on CSS-Tricks.</p>
<p>He doesn‚Äôt do anything special to write about what he learns. He keeps his drafts right there in WordPress. He doesn‚Äôt take special notes. He just writes, and he often writes about what he‚Äôs learning.</p>
<p>Over time he‚Äôs been able to refine his writing and learn what to expect, as far as feedback goes. But at the core he just writes, and through that writing he‚Äôs been able to grow his own audience and get better at everything else he‚Äôs doing professionally.</p>
<h3>Staying consistent and avoiding burnout</h3>
<p>I was curious what Chris has done to stay so consistent online and avoid burnout. It seems to me that a lot of people get temporarily motivated and quickly disenchanted.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve learned in my own experience with the web that any measure of success takes lots and lots of consistent effort. Chris hasn‚Äôt done a lot to think about avoiding burnout, but figures there are some things he subconsciously¬†does to stay motivated.</p>
<p>That may be taking extended breaks from the web and disconnecting for a trip to the woods, or shorter breaks just in the day like stopping and playing the banjo for a few minutes.</p>

      <title>Evermore, hosted WordPress with power and ease of use</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/evermore-752x266.png" alt="evermore" />Finally, finally someone has done it. They‚Äôve combined the power of self-hosted WordPress with the ease of hosted WordPress.com.</p>
<p><a href="https://evermo.re">Evermore</a> is WordPress for everyone. It comes with ‚Äúthe most important functionality built in.‚Äù</p>
<p>There aren‚Äôt loads of tiny upsells like other hosted services (I‚Äôm looking at you, WordPress.com), and there are only two plans. It is not free. You can pay $50 per month, or $75 per month, and each plan comes with a 10x setup fee.</p>
<p>But the result is exactly what you‚Äôd hope for: a very powerful, functional, easy-to-use website.</p>
<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/PostStatus/DraftPodcast/evermore-cliff-seal-draft-podcast-poststatus.mp3">http://s3.amazonaws.com/PostStatus/DraftPodcast/evermore-cliff-seal-draft-podcast-poststatus.mp3</a></p>
<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/PostStatus/DraftPodcast/evermore-cliff-seal-draft-podcast-poststatus.mp3">Direct Download</a></p>
<p>If I had to give Evermore a competitor, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs much¬†closer to Squarespace than WordPress.com. But it‚Äôs built on WordPress, meaning you can leave Evermore any time and take your install with you.</p>
<p>In fact, they sell the ability to leave Evermore as a feature. Because <em>they should</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Evermore offers you true portability and freedom: as your needs outgrow it, we‚Äôll help you move to another service by giving you all the files and instructions you need. We‚Äôll even suggest new hosts that will take care of you and your site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just love that. It reminds me of Kris Kringle in Miracle on 34th Street sending people to another store instead of trying to side-sell them what they don‚Äôt want. Little will help establish my loyalty to a service like the ease one offers me to¬†leave it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have no desire to take WordPress and try to hijack the open source process¬†and make people feel like they‚Äôre closed into another product system.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Who is behind Evermore?</h3>
<p>Evermore is a project by <a href="https://twitter.com/cliffseal">Cliff Seal</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kylewbowman">Kyle Bowman</a>. Cliff is a respected WordPress developer and¬†works full-time at Pardot, a division of SalesForce.</p>
<p>Kyle is an accountant and avid WordPress fan who has invested heavily in the concerns of WordPress users. In our interview, Cliff accounts many Evermore decisions to Kyle‚Äôs attunement to the end user.</p>
<p>Together they make Evermore, a service that represents exactly three clients ‚Äî or a 50% increase since I interviewed Cliff. <img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" /></p>
<p>Yes, Evermore is a new service. But I haven‚Äôt been this excited about a relatively generic WordPress product in a long time.</p>
<p>For one, I think Cliff is a great developer. He‚Äôs the type of guy that will work through the difficult¬†technical challenges a hosted service will inevitably face. For instance, he helped¬†work¬†on the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/14/symlinked-plugins-in-wordpress-3-9/">ability to symlink plugins</a> in WordPress 3.9 before¬†launching Evermore¬†so he could more easily share directories between sites.</p>
<p>Second, I love that Kyle has recently faced some of the same concerns as many of their future customers face. This allows him to be empathetic to their needs and better serve them. His business savvy as a self-described ‚Äúrecovering CPA‚Äù probably won‚Äôt hurt either.</p>
<h3>Why a hosted solution?</h3>
<p>More than Cliff and Kyle‚Äôs qualifications to operate a service like Evermore, I just like their motivations.</p>
<p>Cliff and Kyle felt that there was a gap in the market for web design, development, and maintenance services. They would run into users and site owners with common frustrations: frustrations with getting their initial site setup, managing their hosting and updates, finding the right plugins to use for particular functionality, and more.</p>
<p>They decided they had an opportunity, and they wanted to see if they could fill the gap.</p>
<h3>The process</h3>
<p>Evermore is a multi-stage process. First, there‚Äôs a setup fee. With this fee ($500 for the base plan, $750 for the secondary plan), they‚Äôll walk you through getting a new domain or using your own, choosing a theme and setting up your site with demo content, including sample menus and widgets.</p>
<p>The setup period is currently 24 hours, since they haven‚Äôt automated every aspect of it. They are going to force themselves to scale in this arena, versus automating things that don‚Äôt need it yet. They also want to have that time to do the kind of individual site testing they want to do with early customers.</p>
<p>Once you get setup, they have some generic guides for helping clients manage their site. But for the most part, they don‚Äôt have an interest in massively changing the admin. They want people to feel like they are in WordPress.</p>
<h3>The features</h3>
<p>Evermore is baked with a number of features. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forms</li>
<li>eCommerce</li>
<li>Google Analytics</li>
<li>An events calendar</li>
<li>A slider</li>
<li>Podcasting functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>They are also willing to add functionality over time to enable customers to do more with Evermore.</p>
<p>However, you will never be able to add your own plugins on Evermore. It is restricted in that sense just like other hosted website solutions. This is for support and maintainability reasons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to have this critical mass of knowledge to operate ‚Äî even the best CMS out there. So, instead what we‚Äôve chosen to do is say, curate themes and plugins for you. Especially with plugins, we‚Äôve gone through and combined some of the best plugins specific to features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plugins they use are a blend of commercial plugins they pay for and free plugins from WordPress.org; but importantly they curate the plugins and are able to manage them at a network level to benefit their users. For commercial plugins Evermore uses their own licensing, so site owners don‚Äôt need to own their own versions or manage license keys or anything else.</p>
<p>Evermore currently has 35 themes to choose from. Some are the WordPress default themes, many¬†are¬†from¬†Genesis and¬†StudioPress, and others are free or¬†commercial options from a variety of locations.</p>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>The $50 per month (and $500 setup fee) for Evermore gets users a website setup with a commercial theme, and up to 50,000 monthly visits. The deal is for one website and includes a free domain registration.</p>
<p>The $75 option (and $750 setup fee) includes mostly the same features, but includes support for up to 100,000¬†monthly visits and the option to enable eCommerce.</p>
<p>Regarding the pricing, Cliff calls their choices, ‚Äúa best guess‚Äù based on a year of research he and Kyle have done, to fit in the market that includes a variety of different styles of managed WordPress hosting and support solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as the setup fee goes as well, that‚Äôs an attempt to kind of cover for us as well; because there is nothing stopping¬†you from signing up for a day, getting your website back¬†and asking for the dump and then leaving. ‚Ä¶ And so much of that setup is the difficult part. So much of that expertise, and automation, manual labor and things like that come at the beginning.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Nearly impossible to fail</h3>
<p>Another aspect I really enjoyed about our talk was that no matter how Evermore turns out, Cliff wouldn‚Äôt¬†see it as a failure. They aren‚Äôt trying to scale a free product. They definitely have some up-front investments in Evermore, but more importantly, it equips them to better serve their own service clients both now and in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, honestly I‚Äôm really tired of seeing people launch, sort of, products and SaaS products and things like that and not be able to support anything long term. They have to shut down in six months because they didn‚Äôt have enough money to keep it going.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If other people don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a great idea, then they will be happy with it as a service even for just a few people. They can live with that. There isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúrunway‚Äù to consider, as so often motivates the startup culture.¬†Worst case scenario, Evermore stops taking new customers and just maintains existing customers as long as they are¬†happy. And as Cliff notes, customers have little risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No matter what, there‚Äôs no way to get locked into a bad business decision [as a customer], because you can always leave, and you always have that information, and it‚Äôs always yours to begin with.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Going generic versus a niche</h3>
<p>They basically didn‚Äôt see anyone looking for the market in same way they are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôre trying to explore whether we‚Äôre in the right place or not. ‚Ä¶ Instead of trying to pick a niche and go for it directly ‚Äî we want to see if we can create some awareness in this space. Can we begin solving a problem?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if it ends up that other people come and take the exact idea and target them and ‚Äúrun them out of town‚Äù, they‚Äôll still be happy because they‚Äôll have helped drive the market forward.</p>
<p>While they think multiple people can work in the market together, and that they can do well even with competition, they would love to see the hosted WordPress¬†space evolve.</p>
<h3>The evolution of the hosted WordPress space</h3>
<p>While I think Evermore is going to need to rely on slow growth ‚Äî since organic search will be competitive and hard to come by without a¬†niche ‚Äî I think they can still strike a chord and make some noise in the hosted space by referral and leveraging the power of WordPress as their platform.</p>
<p>I agree with Cliff. I think there is room for dozens of Evermores. Maybe hundreds of them.</p>
<p>It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if many theme shops start creating a seamless theme purchase to hosted website transition for quick setups. Whether that works through white-labeling services with hosts, fully automated hosted solutions, or some kind of hybrid, I think it‚Äôs coming.</p>
<p>I also think that the framing of Evermore as a springboard to the greater WordPress experience shouldn‚Äôt be understated. As a WordPress consultant that often struggles with whether to recommend my friends to WordPress.com or self-hosted WordPress, something like Evermore sounds like exactly the type of service I‚Äôd love to refer people to.</p>
<p>Do I think Evermore is perfect? No, of course not. It‚Äôs a brand new service and product, and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll learn a ton as they onboard new users. But I‚Äôm incredibly excited to see that something like Evermore even exists, and that people like Cliff and Kyle are thinking of these kinds of problems to solve. I really look forward to following up with them in a year to see what they‚Äôve learned and how Evermore has evolved.</p>
<p>If you enjoyed this post and interview, I‚Äôd really appreciate it if you share it. These type of posts take more effort than any other, with hours of research, interviews, processing, and writing. I love doing them, and also love seeing them shared on all your favorite social networks! Also check out <a href="http://chrislema.com/evermore">Chris Lema‚Äôs post on Evermore</a>, which compliments this one well.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/evermore-752x266.png" alt="evermore" />Finally, finally someone has done it. They‚Äôve combined the power of self-hosted WordPress with the ease of hosted WordPress.com.</p>
<p><a href="https://evermo.re">Evermore</a> is WordPress for everyone. It comes with ‚Äúthe most important functionality built in.‚Äù</p>
<p>There aren‚Äôt loads of tiny upsells like other hosted services (I‚Äôm looking at you, WordPress.com), and there are only two plans. It is not free. You can pay $50 per month, or $75 per month, and each plan comes with a 10x setup fee.</p>
<p>But the result is exactly what you‚Äôd hope for: a very powerful, functional, easy-to-use website.</p>

<p>If I had to give Evermore a competitor, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs much¬†closer to Squarespace than WordPress.com. But it‚Äôs built on WordPress, meaning you can leave Evermore any time and take your install with you.</p>
<p>In fact, they sell the ability to leave Evermore as a feature. Because <em>they should</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Evermore offers you true portability and freedom: as your needs outgrow it, we‚Äôll help you move to another service by giving you all the files and instructions you need. We‚Äôll even suggest new hosts that will take care of you and your site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just love that. It reminds me of Kris Kringle in Miracle on 34th Street sending people to another store instead of trying to side-sell them what they don‚Äôt want. Little will help establish my loyalty to a service like the ease one offers me to¬†leave it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have no desire to take WordPress and try to hijack the open source process¬†and make people feel like they‚Äôre closed into another product system.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Who is behind Evermore?</h3>
<p>Evermore is a project by <a href="https://twitter.com/cliffseal">Cliff Seal</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kylewbowman">Kyle Bowman</a>. Cliff is a respected WordPress developer and¬†works full-time at Pardot, a division of SalesForce.</p>
<p>Kyle is an accountant and avid WordPress fan who has invested heavily in the concerns of WordPress users. In our interview, Cliff accounts many Evermore decisions to Kyle‚Äôs attunement to the end user.</p>
<p>Together they make Evermore, a service that represents exactly three clients ‚Äî or a 50% increase since I interviewed Cliff. <img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" /></p>
<p>Yes, Evermore is a new service. But I haven‚Äôt been this excited about a relatively generic WordPress product in a long time.</p>
<p>For one, I think Cliff is a great developer. He‚Äôs the type of guy that will work through the difficult¬†technical challenges a hosted service will inevitably face. For instance, he helped¬†work¬†on the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/14/symlinked-plugins-in-wordpress-3-9/">ability to symlink plugins</a> in WordPress 3.9 before¬†launching Evermore¬†so he could more easily share directories between sites.</p>
<p>Second, I love that Kyle has recently faced some of the same concerns as many of their future customers face. This allows him to be empathetic to their needs and better serve them. His business savvy as a self-described ‚Äúrecovering CPA‚Äù probably won‚Äôt hurt either.</p>
<h3>Why a hosted solution?</h3>
<p>More than Cliff and Kyle‚Äôs qualifications to operate a service like Evermore, I just like their motivations.</p>
<p>Cliff and Kyle felt that there was a gap in the market for web design, development, and maintenance services. They would run into users and site owners with common frustrations: frustrations with getting their initial site setup, managing their hosting and updates, finding the right plugins to use for particular functionality, and more.</p>
<p>They decided they had an opportunity, and they wanted to see if they could fill the gap.</p>
<h3>The process</h3>
<p>Evermore is a multi-stage process. First, there‚Äôs a setup fee. With this fee ($500 for the base plan, $750 for the secondary plan), they‚Äôll walk you through getting a new domain or using your own, choosing a theme and setting up your site with demo content, including sample menus and widgets.</p>
<p>The setup period is currently 24 hours, since they haven‚Äôt automated every aspect of it. They are going to force themselves to scale in this arena, versus automating things that don‚Äôt need it yet. They also want to have that time to do the kind of individual site testing they want to do with early customers.</p>
<p>Once you get setup, they have some generic guides for helping clients manage their site. But for the most part, they don‚Äôt have an interest in massively changing the admin. They want people to feel like they are in WordPress.</p>
<h3>The features</h3>
<p>Evermore is baked with a number of features. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forms</li>
<li>eCommerce</li>
<li>Google Analytics</li>
<li>An events calendar</li>
<li>A slider</li>
<li>Podcasting functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>They are also willing to add functionality over time to enable customers to do more with Evermore.</p>
<p>However, you will never be able to add your own plugins on Evermore. It is restricted in that sense just like other hosted website solutions. This is for support and maintainability reasons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to have this critical mass of knowledge to operate ‚Äî even the best CMS out there. So, instead what we‚Äôve chosen to do is say, curate themes and plugins for you. Especially with plugins, we‚Äôve gone through and combined some of the best plugins specific to features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plugins they use are a blend of commercial plugins they pay for and free plugins from WordPress.org; but importantly they curate the plugins and are able to manage them at a network level to benefit their users. For commercial plugins Evermore uses their own licensing, so site owners don‚Äôt need to own their own versions or manage license keys or anything else.</p>
<p>Evermore currently has 35 themes to choose from. Some are the WordPress default themes, many¬†are¬†from¬†Genesis and¬†StudioPress, and others are free or¬†commercial options from a variety of locations.</p>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>The $50 per month (and $500 setup fee) for Evermore gets users a website setup with a commercial theme, and up to 50,000 monthly visits. The deal is for one website and includes a free domain registration.</p>
<p>The $75 option (and $750 setup fee) includes mostly the same features, but includes support for up to 100,000¬†monthly visits and the option to enable eCommerce.</p>
<p>Regarding the pricing, Cliff calls their choices, ‚Äúa best guess‚Äù based on a year of research he and Kyle have done, to fit in the market that includes a variety of different styles of managed WordPress hosting and support solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as the setup fee goes as well, that‚Äôs an attempt to kind of cover for us as well; because there is nothing stopping¬†you from signing up for a day, getting your website back¬†and asking for the dump and then leaving. ‚Ä¶ And so much of that setup is the difficult part. So much of that expertise, and automation, manual labor and things like that come at the beginning.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Nearly impossible to fail</h3>
<p>Another aspect I really enjoyed about our talk was that no matter how Evermore turns out, Cliff wouldn‚Äôt¬†see it as a failure. They aren‚Äôt trying to scale a free product. They definitely have some up-front investments in Evermore, but more importantly, it equips them to better serve their own service clients both now and in the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, honestly I‚Äôm really tired of seeing people launch, sort of, products and SaaS products and things like that and not be able to support anything long term. They have to shut down in six months because they didn‚Äôt have enough money to keep it going.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If other people don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a great idea, then they will be happy with it as a service even for just a few people. They can live with that. There isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúrunway‚Äù to consider, as so often motivates the startup culture.¬†Worst case scenario, Evermore stops taking new customers and just maintains existing customers as long as they are¬†happy. And as Cliff notes, customers have little risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No matter what, there‚Äôs no way to get locked into a bad business decision [as a customer], because you can always leave, and you always have that information, and it‚Äôs always yours to begin with.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Going generic versus a niche</h3>
<p>They basically didn‚Äôt see anyone looking for the market in same way they are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We‚Äôre trying to explore whether we‚Äôre in the right place or not. ‚Ä¶ Instead of trying to pick a niche and go for it directly ‚Äî we want to see if we can create some awareness in this space. Can we begin solving a problem?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if it ends up that other people come and take the exact idea and target them and ‚Äúrun them out of town‚Äù, they‚Äôll still be happy because they‚Äôll have helped drive the market forward.</p>
<p>While they think multiple people can work in the market together, and that they can do well even with competition, they would love to see the hosted WordPress¬†space evolve.</p>
<h3>The evolution of the hosted WordPress space</h3>
<p>While I think Evermore is going to need to rely on slow growth ‚Äî since organic search will be competitive and hard to come by without a¬†niche ‚Äî I think they can still strike a chord and make some noise in the hosted space by referral and leveraging the power of WordPress as their platform.</p>
<p>I agree with Cliff. I think there is room for dozens of Evermores. Maybe hundreds of them.</p>
<p>It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if many theme shops start creating a seamless theme purchase to hosted website transition for quick setups. Whether that works through white-labeling services with hosts, fully automated hosted solutions, or some kind of hybrid, I think it‚Äôs coming.</p>
<p>I also think that the framing of Evermore as a springboard to the greater WordPress experience shouldn‚Äôt be understated. As a WordPress consultant that often struggles with whether to recommend my friends to WordPress.com or self-hosted WordPress, something like Evermore sounds like exactly the type of service I‚Äôd love to refer people to.</p>
<p>Do I think Evermore is perfect? No, of course not. It‚Äôs a brand new service and product, and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll learn a ton as they onboard new users. But I‚Äôm incredibly excited to see that something like Evermore even exists, and that people like Cliff and Kyle are thinking of these kinds of problems to solve. I really look forward to following up with them in a year to see what they‚Äôve learned and how Evermore has evolved.</p>
<p>If you enjoyed this post and interview, I‚Äôd really appreciate it if you share it. These type of posts take more effort than any other, with hours of research, interviews, processing, and writing. I love doing them, and also love seeing them shared on all your favorite social networks!

      <title>WP eCommerce: What‚Äôs old is new again.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/wp-ecommerce-752x291.jpg" alt="wp-ecommerce" />WP eCommerce is one of the oldest WordPress plugins you‚Äôll find. That it‚Äôs an eCommerce plugin ‚Äî built on WordPress, well before such a thing seemed sensible ‚Äî is even more of a testament to just how impressive this plugin is. It‚Äôs been under development for eight years, and is nearing 3 million downloads <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce">on WordPress.org</a>.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="http://getshopped.org/">WP eCommerce</a> is working to shed layers of duplicate functionality that can now be replaced by WordPress core. It‚Äôs a wicked thing for a product to be ahead of its time. An eCommerce plugin built on WordPress is clearly ‚Äî we know today ‚Äî a viable thing. But for years, as WP eCommerce chugged¬†along, many were skeptical that eCommerce and WordPress could ‚Äî or even should ‚Äî be harmonious.</p>
<p>That WP eCommerce is so old is its blessing and its curse. The blessing is that it was the only major player for a long time, allowing it to achieve great success, relative to other commercial plugins of the time. Its curse is that it gained a reputation for bugginess and as a product that was trying to be a round peg in a square hole.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs safe to say that WP eCommerce has passed the time where anyone should doubt it‚Äôs a viable product. But the question remains: can something old be new again?</p>
<p>Dan Milward and Justin Sainton believe so. And they are now 50 / 50 partners to ensure it.</p>
<p>For years, Dan ran WP eCommerce under the umbrella of <a href="http://instinct.co.nz/">Instinct Entertainment</a>. While WP eCommerce wasn‚Äôt Instinct‚Äôs only project, it was its largest for a long time. Dan hired support staff and developers to help maintain the product and manage customers of their premium support tokens.</p>
<p>Justin Sainton has been contributing to WP eCommerce since 2010. He‚Äôs¬†written nearly 70,000 lines of code and deleted nearly 30,000 lines of code from the codebase, just since they started tracking activity on <a href="https://github.com/wp-e-commerce/WP-e-Commerce">Github</a> in 2011. He‚Äôs got more commits to the project than any of the other 39 contributors. At times, Justin has been the lifeblood of WP eCommerce development.</p>
<p>Now that the two are partnered, they are ready to move ahead with full steam.</p>

<h3>Born out of need</h3>
<p>Dan was building websites with b2, pre-WordPress. He remembers when the repository was on a third party website, with only twenty or so plugins. He had a customer looking to sell plumbing related supplies online. Dan looked at osCommerce and Zen Cart to see if they could do the job. The hosted solutions we know today, and even Magento, didn‚Äôt exist yet. Dan had the wild idea to build it in WordPress, and¬†the client let them release¬†it to the public.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world‚Äôs first eCommerce plugin for WordPress was born out of a need to cater to plumbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was in 2006.</p>
<h3>Instant growth</h3>
<p>The plugin took off very quickly. Dan remembers launching ‚ÄúGold Cart‚Äù, their premium version of WP eCommerce, on a Friday, and was blown away by the transaction history he saw the very next day. The success was unexpected.</p>
<p>They never thought it‚Äôd be the kind of plugin ‚Äúthat would end up being used by millions of people around the world.‚Äù And if he could go back, he says he probably would‚Äôve done it differently.</p>
<p>Today, WP eCommerce powers sites large and small. They know of sites with upwards of 100,00 products and / or seven figures in revenue. Impressive numbers.</p>
<h3>Retro-fitted</h3>
<p>One of the hardest parts of development of WP eCommerce has been growing with WordPress and retro-fitting the plugin to utilize functionality and APIs that WordPress offers in core.</p>
<p>The best example of this is for custom post types. Custom post types were not introduced until WordPress 3.0, meaning that it took a significant effort and change of the WP eCommerce codebase to utilize custom post types, and all the benefits that go along with using them.</p>
<h3>The Jetpack of WP eCommerce</h3>
<p>Gold Cart is what Dan calls the Jetpack of WP eCommerce. In an attempt¬†at longevity, WP eCommerce was an early player in the commercial plugin market. They quickly offered a premium version of WP eCommerce.</p>
<p>They now monetize in two ways. They have support tokens, as well as commercial add-ons. Support for WP eCommerce is managed via Help Scout.</p>
<h3>Justin‚Äôs entrance to WP eCommerce</h3>
<p>Justin also got into eCommerce with WordPress due to client work. He‚Äôs been working with WordPress since 2007, but he‚Äôs been doing eCommerce since 2005. So he quickly searched for WordPress eCommerce integrations, and therefore found WP eCommerce. By 2008 and 2009 he was using WP eCommerce for client work, and he reach out to Dan to figure out how he could start contributing.</p>
<p>Justin got heavily involved with WP eCommerce when they were making the switch to using custom post types. He helped guide the plugin from using around 40 custom tables to 13 custom tables today.</p>
<p>He‚Äôs been the biggest contributor to WP eCommerce ever since. With the release of WP eCommerce 3.9, their new partnership becomes official.</p>
<h3>The new structure of Instinct</h3>
<p>Instinct is now focused on WP eCommerce, and Dan‚Äôs other projects (like <a href="http://gamefroot.com/">Gamefroot</a>,¬†an impressive¬†HTML5-centric gaming entity) have shifted over to a different organization. Justin and Dan are now managing the day to day of WP eCommerce through Instinct.</p>
<p>The team of support providers and paid developers will be managed under the new Instinct.</p>
<h3>Long term opportunities</h3>
<p>WP eCommerce 3.9 will be a huge release for them. The features in this release include nearly five years of work between Justin, Ryan McCue, Gary Cao, and others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of these have been developed as the ‚Äúfeatures as plugins‚Äù concept over the last five years. So that was something that¬†we were a little bit early to market with as a concept.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few of the new features:</p>
<h4>1) A new theme engine.</h4>
<p>It‚Äôs not as easy as it should be to create themes, so they are fixing that with 3.9. They have a number of commercial theme developers they are working with to help create themes with the new theme engine this year.</p>
<h4>2) New payment gateway API</h4>
<p>WP eCommerce will have a much simpler and more flexible API for managing payment gateway integrations with 3.9. It will replace an API that‚Äôs been in existence since 2009.</p>
<h4>3) Marketplace functionality</h4>
<p>The most impressive functionality to Justin (and to me too) is the marketplace functionality they‚Äôre building into WP eCommerce 3.9. This means that people who¬†install WP eCommerce will be able to view and shop extensions for WP eCommerce through the admin, and purchase straight through that system.</p>
<p>They hope to open up third party development considerably with this feature.</p>
<h3>A product to be proud of</h3>
<p>One of the most impressive parts of the interview was when Dan talked about the rise and slow fall of WP eCommerce as other platforms ‚Äúleapfrogged‚Äù them.</p>
<p>At one point, they figured that around 250,000 users had migrated to using WordPress with WP eCommerce. But over time, as development stagnated some, he knew that it wasn‚Äôt the same type of product as it once was ‚Äî a product that he was super proud of and ready to go to WordCamps and promote.</p>
<p>However, as they are now entering the final stages of 3.9 and even gear toward 4.0, they are ready to go head-on again marketing and promoting what they think can still¬†be a¬†go-to solution for WordPress eCommerce.</p>
<h3>Evolve or die</h3>
<p>‚ÄúEvolve or die.‚Äù This is the Darwinian quote Dan used to describe the necessary change that an open market creates for products. WP eCommerce has certainly had to evolve. Yes, they were early to market, but they were probably (in my opinion) too early to market.</p>
<p>Now, they‚Äôre evolving, and working hard to once again be the big player in the market. And they‚Äôve got longevity on their side, which is a benefit¬†that is¬†often undervalued.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The WordPress space is a big space, right? ‚Ä¶ eCommerce can mean so much.¬†‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs plenty of opportunity to do new things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are excited and confident about what the future holds WordPress and WP eCommerce. They believe there are untouched niches and market segments that have a lot of potential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don‚Äôt want to just compete. We want to be doing new and innovative things ‚Äî which is what we‚Äôve always done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked¬†where some of that potential is, and Dan said at least a couple areas where he sees potential are¬†in-app purchasing experiences and the¬†user-interface.</p>
<h3>Prioritizing goals</h3>
<p>Justin has a lot of plans for future development. While he has a list of long term goals, he‚Äôs also outlined shorter term plans.</p>
<h4>The Product</h4>
<p>He wants to zero in on the WP eCommerce product itself. He‚Äôs not necessarily interested in WP eCommerce in terms of how it competes feature-for-feature with other WordPress eCommerce options as much as how strongly it stands on its own.</p>
<h4>The community</h4>
<p>Justin wants to empower the developer community surrounding WP eCommerce to feel welcome and encouraged to contribute.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I enter a community that I‚Äôm new to, and I feel immediately that I don‚Äôt have a voice, that‚Äôs going to turn me off pretty quick to staying active in that community.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Partnership development</h4>
<p>Justin and Dan both see a ton of potential with connecting and integrating with some of the thousands of other platforms, services, and softwares that are part of the overall eCommerce process.</p>
<h3>Longevity as a feature</h3>
<p>Justin has run his consulting company, Zao, for ten years now. Both Justin and Dan have been involved in the WordPress community for a long time. They intend to be involved in the WordPress ecosystem for a long time to come.</p>
<p>In my mind, their collective experience and expertise are¬†a considerable asset to the future of WP eCommerce. When someone is choosing what eCommerce platform to use, longevity of those providing the software is a huge feature. Nobody wants to invest in building a site on software that will become unsupported during the lifetime of the project.</p>
<p>WP eCommerce has been around longer than any other eCommerce platform, and I think they can combine this history with their more modern features to really strongly market their position in the WordPress eCommerce space and the eCommerce space in general.</p>
<h3>Spreading the word</h3>
<p>WP eCommerce does still face¬†a number of challenges. One of these is spreading the word. Not only do they need to spread the word that WP eCommerce exists, but also that it‚Äôs good again.</p>
<p>Justin used the example of a WordCamp he went to, where he asked the crowd who had heard of WP eCommerce, and about 70% of the room raised their hand. When he asked those that loved it to keep their hand raised, only about 20% of the room kept their hand up. Jokingly, he said, ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôve got some work to do. Let‚Äôs talk.‚Äù</p>
<p>This is the kind of attitude that I think can make WP eCommerce successful, in a big way.</p>
<p>In addition to WordCamps and evangelizing to developers, they are also sponsoring and organizing sponsoring smaller events. Just last week, Justin headed up the organization of BeachPress, a micro event¬†of about 30 developers in a beach house on Oregon‚Äôs coast. Events like this and the personal relationships that come from them are what will help¬†them find¬†willing contributors and product advocates.</p>
<h3>A new stage¬†for a new plugin</h3>
<p>While the WP eCommerce plugin approaches a new stage of life, you wouldn‚Äôt really know it by looking at <a href="http://getshopped.org/">GetShopped.org</a>, the landing page for the plugin. This, along with other internal infrastructure issues, are additional goals for improvement for Justin and Dan.</p>
<p>They are planning to re-analyze business models, restructure documentation, rebuild the website, and much more. Dan notes that getting past the technical challenges of the upcoming versions of the¬†plugin is like ridding themselves of shackles.</p>
<p>Depending on how well the changes are received, Dan and Justin are also prepared to put more and more of their focus on WP eCommerce versus their other projects. WP eCommerce is their priority, and they plan to see it through.</p>
<p>WP eCommerce really does remind me of the saying that, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs old is new again.‚Äù</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing how the rollout of WP eCommerce 3.9 goes, and how the community responds. I have a feeling that we‚Äôre going to see a second life for WP eCommerce, not as a replacement to other options, but to a place back in the front-runner category for viable WordPress eCommerce options.</p>
<p>If you want to keep track of WP eCommerce, you can do so on their <a href="http://getshopped.org/">main website</a>, and follow <a href="https://twitter.com/danmilward">Dan Milward</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JS_Zao">Justin Sainton</a> on Twitter.</p>

Dan hired support staff and developers to help maintain the product and manage customers of their premium support tokens.</p>
<p>Justin Sainton has been contributing to WP eCommerce since 2010. He‚Äôs¬†written nearly 70,000 lines of code and deleted nearly 30,000 lines of code from the codebase, just since they started tracking activity on <a href="https://github.com/wp-e-commerce/WP-e-Commerce">Github</a> in 2011. He‚Äôs got more commits to the project than any of the other 39 contributors. At times, Justin has been the lifeblood of WP eCommerce development.</p>
<p>Now that the two are partnered, they are ready to move ahead with full steam.</p>

<h3>Born out of need</h3>
<p>Dan was building websites with b2, pre-WordPress. He remembers when the repository was on a third party website, with only twenty or so plugins. He had a customer looking to sell plumbing related supplies online. Dan looked at osCommerce and Zen Cart to see if they could do the job. The hosted solutions we know today, and even Magento, didn‚Äôt exist yet. Dan had the wild idea to build it in WordPress, and¬†the client let them release¬†it to the public.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world‚Äôs first eCommerce plugin for WordPress was born out of a need to cater to plumbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was in 2006.</p>
<h3>Instant growth</h3>
<p>The plugin took off very quickly. Dan remembers launching ‚ÄúGold Cart‚Äù, their premium version of WP eCommerce, on a Friday, and was blown away by the transaction history he saw the very next day. The success was unexpected.</p>
<p>They never thought it‚Äôd be the kind of plugin ‚Äúthat would end up being used by millions of people around the world.‚Äù And if he could go back, he says he probably would‚Äôve done it differently.</p>
<p>Today, WP eCommerce powers sites large and small. They know of sites with upwards of 100,00 products and / or seven figures in revenue. Impressive numbers.</p>
<h3>Retro-fitted</h3>
<p>One of the hardest parts of development of WP eCommerce has been growing with WordPress and retro-fitting the plugin to utilize functionality and APIs that WordPress offers in core.</p>
<p>The best example of this is for custom post types. Custom post types were not introduced until WordPress 3.0, meaning that it took a significant effort and change of the WP eCommerce codebase to utilize custom post types, and all the benefits that go along with using them.</p>
<h3>The Jetpack of WP eCommerce</h3>
<p>Gold Cart is what Dan calls the Jetpack of WP eCommerce. In an attempt¬†at longevity, WP eCommerce was an early player in the commercial plugin market. They quickly offered a premium version of WP eCommerce.</p>
<p>They now monetize in two ways. They have support tokens, as well as commercial add-ons. Support for WP eCommerce is managed via Help Scout.</p>
<h3>Justin‚Äôs entrance to WP eCommerce</h3>
<p>Justin also got into eCommerce with WordPress due to client work. He‚Äôs been working with WordPress since 2007, but he‚Äôs been doing eCommerce since 2005. So he quickly searched for WordPress eCommerce integrations, and therefore found WP eCommerce. By 2008 and 2009 he was using WP eCommerce for client work, and he reach out to Dan to figure out how he could start contributing.</p>
<p>Justin got heavily involved with WP eCommerce when they were making the switch to using custom post types. He helped guide the plugin from using around 40 custom tables to 13 custom tables today.</p>
<p>He‚Äôs been the biggest contributor to WP eCommerce ever since. With the release of WP eCommerce 3.9, their new partnership becomes official.</p>
<h3>The new structure of Instinct</h3>
<p>Instinct is now focused on WP eCommerce, and Dan‚Äôs other projects (like <a href="http://gamefroot.com/">Gamefroot</a>,¬†an impressive¬†HTML5-centric gaming entity) have shifted over to a different organization. Justin and Dan are now managing the day to day of WP eCommerce through Instinct.</p>
<p>The team of support providers and paid developers will be managed under the new Instinct.</p>
<h3>Long term opportunities</h3>
<p>WP eCommerce 3.9 will be a huge release for them. The features in this release include nearly five years of work between Justin, Ryan McCue, Gary Cao, and others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of these have been developed as the ‚Äúfeatures as plugins‚Äù concept over the last five years. So that was something that¬†we were a little bit early to market with as a concept.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few of the new features:</p>
<h4>1) A new theme engine.</h4>
<p>It‚Äôs not as easy as it should be to create themes, so they are fixing that with 3.9. They have a number of commercial theme developers they are working with to help create themes with the new theme engine this year.</p>
<h4>2) New payment gateway API</h4>
<p>WP eCommerce will have a much simpler and more flexible API for managing payment gateway integrations with 3.9. It will replace an API that‚Äôs been in existence since 2009.</p>
<h4>3) Marketplace functionality</h4>
<p>The most impressive functionality to Justin (and to me too) is the marketplace functionality they‚Äôre building into WP eCommerce 3.9. This means that people who¬†install WP eCommerce will be able to view and shop extensions for WP eCommerce through the admin, and purchase straight through that system.</p>
<p>They hope to open up third party development considerably with this feature.</p>
<h3>A product to be proud of</h3>
<p>One of the most impressive parts of the interview was when Dan talked about the rise and slow fall of WP eCommerce as other platforms ‚Äúleapfrogged‚Äù them.</p>
<p>At one point, they figured that around 250,000 users had migrated to using WordPress with WP eCommerce. But over time, as development stagnated some, he knew that it wasn‚Äôt the same type of product as it once was ‚Äî a product that he was super proud of and ready to go to WordCamps and promote.</p>
<p>However, as they are now entering the final stages of 3.9 and even gear toward 4.0, they are ready to go head-on again marketing and promoting what they think can still¬†be a¬†go-to solution for WordPress eCommerce.</p>
<h3>Evolve or die</h3>
<p>‚ÄúEvolve or die.‚Äù This is the Darwinian quote Dan used to describe the necessary change that an open market creates for products. WP eCommerce has certainly had to evolve. Yes, they were early to market, but they were probably (in my opinion) too early to market.</p>
<p>Now, they‚Äôre evolving, and working hard to once again be the big player in the market. And they‚Äôve got longevity on their side, which is a benefit¬†that is¬†often undervalued.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The WordPress space is a big space, right? ‚Ä¶ eCommerce can mean so much.¬†‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs plenty of opportunity to do new things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are excited and confident about what the future holds WordPress and WP eCommerce. They believe there are untouched niches and market segments that have a lot of potential.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We don‚Äôt want to just compete. We want to be doing new and innovative things ‚Äî which is what we‚Äôve always done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I asked¬†where some of that potential is, and Dan said at least a couple areas where he sees potential are¬†in-app purchasing experiences and the¬†user-interface.</p>
<h3>Prioritizing goals</h3>
<p>Justin has a lot of plans for future development. While he has a list of long term goals, he‚Äôs also outlined shorter term plans.</p>
<h4>The Product</h4>
<p>He wants to zero in on the WP eCommerce product itself. He‚Äôs not necessarily interested in WP eCommerce in terms of how it competes feature-for-feature with other WordPress eCommerce options as much as how strongly it stands on its own.</p>
<h4>The community</h4>
<p>Justin wants to empower the developer community surrounding WP eCommerce to feel welcome and encouraged to contribute.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I enter a community that I‚Äôm new to, and I feel immediately that I don‚Äôt have a voice, that‚Äôs going to turn me off pretty quick to staying active in that community.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Partnership development</h4>
<p>Justin and Dan both see a ton of potential with connecting and integrating with some of the thousands of other platforms, services, and softwares that are part of the overall eCommerce process.</p>
<h3>Longevity as a feature</h3>
<p>Justin has run his consulting company, Zao, for ten years now. Both Justin and Dan have been involved in the WordPress community for a long time. They intend to be involved in the WordPress ecosystem for a long time to come.</p>
<p>In my mind, their collective experience and expertise are¬†a considerable asset to the future of WP eCommerce. When someone is choosing what eCommerce platform to use, longevity of those providing the software is a huge feature. Nobody wants to invest in building a site on software that will become unsupported during the lifetime of the project.</p>
<p>WP eCommerce has been around longer than any other eCommerce platform, and I think they can combine this history with their more modern features to really strongly market their position in the WordPress eCommerce space and the eCommerce space in general.</p>
<h3>Spreading the word</h3>
<p>WP eCommerce does still face¬†a number of challenges. One of these is spreading the word. Not only do they need to spread the word that WP eCommerce exists, but also that it‚Äôs good again.</p>
<p>Justin used the example of a WordCamp he went to, where he asked the crowd who had heard of WP eCommerce, and about 70% of the room raised their hand. When he asked those that loved it to keep their hand raised, only about 20% of the room kept their hand up. Jokingly, he said, ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôve got some work to do. Let‚Äôs talk.‚Äù</p>
<p>This is the kind of attitude that I think can make WP eCommerce successful, in a big way.</p>
<p>In addition to WordCamps and evangelizing to developers, they are also sponsoring and organizing sponsoring smaller events. Just last week, Justin headed up the organization of BeachPress, a micro event¬†of about 30 developers in a beach house on Oregon‚Äôs coast. Events like this and the personal relationships that come from them are what will help¬†them find¬†willing contributors and product advocates.</p>
<h3>A new stage¬†for a new plugin</h3>
<p>While the WP eCommerce plugin approaches a new stage of life, you wouldn‚Äôt really know it by looking at <a href="http://getshopped.org/">GetShopped.org</a>, the landing page for the plugin. This, along with other internal infrastructure issues, are additional goals for improvement for Justin and Dan.</p>
<p>They are planning to re-analyze business models, restructure documentation, rebuild the website, and much more. Dan notes that getting past the technical challenges of the upcoming versions of the¬†plugin is like ridding themselves of shackles.</p>
<p>Depending on how well the changes are received, Dan and Justin are also prepared to put more and more of their focus on WP eCommerce versus their other projects. WP eCommerce is their priority, and they plan to see it through.</p>
<p>WP eCommerce really does remind me of the saying that, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs old is new again.‚Äù</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing how the rollout of WP eCommerce 3.9 goes, and how the community responds. I have a feeling that we‚Äôre going to see a second life for WP eCommerce, not as a replacement to other options, but to a place back in the front-runner category for viable WordPress eCommerce options.</p>
<p>If you want to keep track of WP eCommerce, you can do so on their <a href="http://getshopped.org/">main website</a>, and follow <a href="https://twitter.com/danmilward">Dan Milward</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JS_Zao">Justin Sainton</a> on Twitter.</p>

      <title>From ThemeForest to Array, the story of a theme business</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/array-mike-mcalister-752x314.jpg" alt="array-mike-mcalister" /> <a href="https://twitter.com/mikemcalister">Mike McAlister</a> has been an active member¬†of the commercial WordPress theme space¬†since 2009. He started by selling themes on <a href="themeforest.net">ThemeForest</a>. He transitioned to the Okay Themes brand in December of 2011.¬†And at the end of March of this year, Mike transitioned yet again <a href="https://array.is/news/introducing-array/">to Array</a>.</p>
<p>While these transitions may seem like arbitrary branding, to me they represent broader shifts both in Mike‚Äôs style and the direction of the¬†commercial¬†WordPress space in general. He‚Äôs never really attempted to fit anyone else‚Äôs mold, but I believe he‚Äôs done quite well at predicting the market and staying ahead of the pack; and that‚Äôs why I love¬†following his work.</p>
<p>Mike consistently challenges himself to succeed in a saturated space by attacking the market in a different way than the rest of the crowd.</p>

<h3>Selling WordPress themes¬†on ThemeForest</h3>
<p>In 2009, Mike discovered WordPress and saw the opportunities of the commercial WordPress space. He quickly got his first ThemeForest theme put together, which he admits was probably sub-par code; but it got¬†him started on his journey to consistently sell themes at a fairly¬†early stage of the market.</p>
<p>ThemeForest has always been a controversial space. From a consumer side, with nice designs and a huge selection, it‚Äôs an easy way to discover themes ‚Äî hence the¬†popularity and explosive growth of the marketplace. From the non-ThemeForest developer side (developers dealing with ThemeForest themes), it‚Äôs often a¬†frustrating marketplace because good code is very difficult to quantify on ThemeForest themes, making it difficult to steer people away from bad themes.</p>
<p>But there‚Äôs also the seller‚Äôs viewpoint. Exclusive sellers on ThemeForest start by making 50% of the revenue on a sale. Once they hit elite status ($75,000 in cumulative sales), they max out at 70%. But for non-exclusive partnerships, sellers only make 33.33% of the sale, which strongly encourages exclusive authorship for ThemeForest community members. More than four out of five ThemeForest authors <a href="http://themeforest.net/make_money/become_an_author">are exclusive</a> authors.</p>
<h3>Moving the market forward</h3>
<p>Selling on ThemeForest means that you accept the terms of the marketplace, both as a buyer and a seller. Over the years, this has resulted in a variety of public debates. Mike <a href="http://wpcandy.com/thinks/about-35-dollar-themes/">started one such debate</a> on pricing, when he advocated for a change in the pricing model. The debate Mike helped start is what led Envato to establish the <a href="http://elite.envato.com/">elite program</a>, which at the time gave elite authors more flexibility for pricing, and higher rewards for various achievements.</p>
<p>Throughout his tenure on ThemeForest, Mike was part of a core group of authors that helped move the marketplace forward. I saw Mike participate in community conversations regarding price, bucking design trends, methods¬†for offering theme support, licensing themes, and more. Authors like Mike helped make Envato a better place.</p>
<h3>Establishing Okay</h3>
<p>One of the things Mike discovered as he became a more experienced theme developer was that support was easier with simpler themes. Also, simpler themes allowed him to make design decisions versus offering design options.</p>
<p>In December 2011, Mike made the transition to simpler themes official with the launch of Okay Themes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don‚Äôt want that to be the bulk of my business. I don‚Äôt want to be answering questions about settings. You know, that seems adverse to everything I‚Äôm trying to do.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I started ripping things out slowly over the years, taking out various settings and going with the mantra of ‚Äòdecisions not options‚Äô ‚Äì that kind of thing ‚Äì and really just spending the time to make these decisions, you know, add the details where I thought they¬†needed to be and just whitling¬†it down to a very, very simple theme that just works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a decision doesn‚Äôt come lightly. When the <a href="https://poststatus.com/themeforest-theme-nets-over-100000-per-month-sadly/">proven model is options-centered</a>, taking the other route takes guts.</p>
<p>Mike‚Äôs themes evolved into much simpler¬†products. He tried to make a specific theme for a specific purpose versus creating a generic theme for any purpose that could be reused for dozens of sites.</p>
<p>Okay Themes had successes and failures on ThemeForest, but Mike was able to establish a reputation and a brand around well designed, simple themes that are reliably free of the bloat ThemeForest is infamous for. It‚Äôs what made his themes a go-to recommendation for many WordPress developers, myself included.</p>
<p>Over time, Mike realized he wanted to fully separate from Envato.</p>
<p>Despite all of the positive change over the years from Envato leadership, it doesn‚Äôt make the consumer‚Äôs decision making skills any better. And Mike‚Äôs style of theme didn‚Äôt really fit perfectly any more with the style of customer ThemeForest tends to have.</p>
<h3>Selling themes on WordPress.com</h3>
<p>One way Mike has reached out to more user-centric customers, versus ‚Äúflippers‚Äù, is through the <a href="http://theme.wordpress.com/?theme_shop=array">WordPress.com marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>Mike was invited to the WordPress.com marketplace and <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/08/01/publisher-zoren/">launched Publisher</a> in August of 2013. The experience was enlightening for him.</p>
<p>Envato has theme reviews, but it has never reached anything close to the¬†level of code critique <a href="http://developer.wordpress.com/themes/">that WordPress.com offers</a>. Themes distributed to WordPress.com require complete review and assurances that they will be able to scale incredibly well. Therefore, all new authors are mentored under an Automattician ‚ÄúTheme Wrangler‚Äù that guides them as they prepare their theme for the marketplace.</p>
<p>This experience led Mike to re-evaluate and improve (with the help of <a href="https://array.is/about/">his team</a>) nearly all of his themes. The result was that he became even more committed to simple themes that do a job and do it well.</p>
<h3>Okay is now Array</h3>
<p>The experience with WordPress.com and his desire to create a different kind of theme led Mike to further consider his relationship as a seller on Envato‚Äôs ThemeForest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs hard to be a part of that, when ultimately my philosophy is quite drastically different these days, and I‚Äôm trying to target a different crowd. So, yeah, it culminated, and here we are in April, and Okay is now Array.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mike completely rebranded Okay Themes to Array. The project included logo and identity work from <a href="http://heavyheavy.com/work/array/">Heavy Heavy</a>, an entirely new website, and¬†of course the new name. In the launch post, he assures that the change doesn‚Äôt mark a new¬†‚Äúway of doing business,‚Äù¬†but a¬†transition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Okay Themes</em>¬†will now be known simply as¬†_ <strong>Array</strong> _. We (still) specialize in beautifully crafted, high quality WordPress goods. New name, new website, new logo, same way of doing business.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Pricing themes</h3>
<p>Array <a href="https://array.is/pricing/">themes cost</a> $69 each right now, or you can buy access to all of them for $199 per year. Currently Array does not auto-renew packages.</p>
<p>We spent some time talking about how renewals work across the industry, as well as some ideas for creating licenses for longer update periods, and perhaps separating those from support pricing (okay, this was mostly me spouting off).</p>
<h3>Tools behind a theme shop</h3>
<p>We spent also spent some time going over the variety of tools Mike uses to¬†power the Array website.</p>
<p>Like many theme shops nowadays, Array is running eCommerce with <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/">Easy Digital Downloads</a>, which manages both digital downloads as well as software licensing and updates. They also switched from <a href="http://tenderapp.com/">Tender</a> to <a href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a> for support, which I thought was interesting, since I feel like there‚Äôs been a trend of moving away from forums.</p>
<p>The whole post about <a href="https://array.is/free-resources/tools-behind-wordpress-theme-shop/">tools Array uses</a> is really interesting and worth checking out.</p>
<h3>Advice to other theme authors</h3>
<p>As one of a number of theme authors that have taken the route from a theme marketplace to his own marketplace, I was curious what Mike‚Äôs advice would be to others aiming to start their own theme shop.</p>
<p>In general, he would still encourage new authors to utilize a marketplace like ThemeForest to get started and get their name out there. We both largely agreed with Chris Lema‚Äôs post that <a href="http://chrislema.com/maybe-real-benefit-themeforest/">a marketplace can be a great incubator</a> for a WordPress product maker.</p>
<p>However, if someone does start on a marketplace, they do need to be aware that when and if they make the switch to their own shop, they basically have to start over from an SEO and marketing perspective.</p>
<p>SEO may seem like an odd thing to an outsider to the theme industry, but when the market is as saturated as it is, it takes a lot of work to get your themes out in front of a largely theme-uneducated audience.</p>
<p>Mike‚Äôs primary advice was to ‚Äúmake it manageable‚Äù from the very beginning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make it as manageable as possible. Write clean code, not just because it looks nice, but because it‚Äôs manageable, and then you won‚Äôt spend a bunch of time rewriting it later. And just spread that throughout your whole business. Make it simple to begin with. Make it manageable.</p>
<p>Use the right tools. Use quality tools that get the job done, and treat your customers with respect. It goes a long way when people actually get a nice quality response and conversation out of something.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Just talking themes</h3>
<p>I‚Äôve tried to summarize much of Mike‚Äôs story in this post, as I‚Äôve done with <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft/">other interviews</a>. However, we spent around 50 minutes talking about the ins and outs of WordPress themes, business, and other things. It was one of the most fun and laid back interviews I‚Äôve ever had the privilege of conducting.</p>
<p>I hope that you listen to the entire thing, and I hope that you enjoy it. I love doing these, and I hope to keep bringing them to you. That said, I‚Äôd also really appreciate any feedback readers and listeners have as to how I can make these posts better.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mike for joining me for this interview, and everyone be sure to check out his excellent new adventure, <a href="https://array.is">Array</a>.</p>

<p>Such a decision doesn‚Äôt come lightly. When the <a href="https://poststatus.com/themeforest-theme-nets-over-100000-per-month-sadly/">proven model is options-centered</a>, taking the other route takes guts.</p>
<p>Mike‚Äôs themes evolved into much simpler¬†products. He tried to make a specific theme for a specific purpose versus creating a generic theme for any purpose that could be reused for dozens of sites.</p>
<p>Okay Themes had successes and failures on ThemeForest, but Mike was able to establish a reputation and a brand around well designed, simple themes that are reliably free of the bloat ThemeForest is infamous for. It‚Äôs what made his themes a go-to recommendation for many WordPress developers, myself included.</p>
<p>Over time, Mike realized he wanted to fully separate from Envato.</p>
<p>Despite all of the positive change over the years from Envato leadership, it doesn‚Äôt make the consumer‚Äôs decision making skills any better. And Mike‚Äôs style of theme didn‚Äôt really fit perfectly any more with the style of customer ThemeForest tends to have.</p>
<h3>Selling themes on WordPress.com</h3>
<p>One way Mike has reached out to more user-centric customers, versus ‚Äúflippers‚Äù, is through the <a href="http://theme.wordpress.com/?theme_shop=array">WordPress.com marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>Mike was invited to the WordPress.com marketplace and <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/08/01/publisher-zoren/">launched Publisher</a> in August of 2013. The experience was enlightening for him.</p>
<p>Envato has theme reviews, but it has never reached anything close to the¬†level of code critique <a href="http://developer.wordpress.com/themes/">that WordPress.com offers</a>. Themes distributed to WordPress.com require complete review and assurances that they will be able to scale incredibly well. Therefore, all new authors are mentored under an Automattician ‚ÄúTheme Wrangler‚Äù that guides them as they prepare their theme for the marketplace.</p>
<p>This experience led Mike to re-evaluate and improve (with the help of <a href="https://array.is/about/">his team</a>) nearly all of his themes. The result was that he became even more committed to simple themes that do a job and do it well.</p>
<h3>Okay is now Array</h3>
<p>The experience with WordPress.com and his desire to create a different kind of theme led Mike to further consider his relationship as a seller on Envato‚Äôs ThemeForest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It‚Äôs hard to be a part of that, when ultimately my philosophy is quite drastically different these days, and I‚Äôm trying to target a different crowd. So, yeah, it culminated, and here we are in April, and Okay is now Array.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mike completely rebranded Okay Themes to Array. The project included logo and identity work from <a href="http://heavyheavy.com/work/array/">Heavy Heavy</a>, an entirely new website, and¬†of course the new name. In the launch post, he assures that the change doesn‚Äôt mark a new¬†‚Äúway of doing business,‚Äù¬†but a¬†transition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Okay Themes</em>¬†will now be known simply as¬†_ <strong>Array</strong> _. We (still) specialize in beautifully crafted, high quality WordPress goods. New name, new website, new logo, same way of doing business.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Pricing themes</h3>
<p>Array <a href="https://array.is/pricing/">themes cost</a> $69 each right now, or you can buy access to all of them for $199 per year. Currently Array does not auto-renew packages.</p>
<p>We spent some time talking about how renewals work across the industry, as well as some ideas for creating licenses for longer update periods, and perhaps separating those from support pricing (okay, this was mostly me spouting off).</p>
<h3>Tools behind a theme shop</h3>
<p>We spent also spent some time going over the variety of tools Mike uses to¬†power the Array website.</p>
<p>Like many theme shops nowadays, Array is running eCommerce with <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/">Easy Digital Downloads</a>, which manages both digital downloads as well as software licensing and updates. They also switched from <a href="http://tenderapp.com/">Tender</a> to <a href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a> for support, which I thought was interesting, since I feel like there‚Äôs been a trend of moving away from forums.</p>
<p>The whole post about <a href="https://array.is/free-resources/tools-behind-wordpress-theme-shop/">tools Array uses</a> is really interesting and worth checking out.</p>
<h3>Advice to other theme authors</h3>
<p>As one of a number of theme authors that have taken the route from a theme marketplace to his own marketplace, I was curious what Mike‚Äôs advice would be to others aiming to start their own theme shop.</p>
<p>In general, he would still encourage new authors to utilize a marketplace like ThemeForest to get started and get their name out there. We both largely agreed with Chris Lema‚Äôs post that <a href="http://chrislema.com/maybe-real-benefit-themeforest/">a marketplace can be a great incubator</a> for a WordPress product maker.</p>
<p>However, if someone does start on a marketplace, they do need to be aware that when and if they make the switch to their own shop, they basically have to start over from an SEO and marketing perspective.</p>
<p>SEO may seem like an odd thing to an outsider to the theme industry, but when the market is as saturated as it is, it takes a lot of work to get your themes out in front of a largely theme-uneducated audience.</p>
<p>Mike‚Äôs primary advice was to ‚Äúmake it manageable‚Äù from the very beginning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make it as manageable as possible. Write clean code, not just because it looks nice, but because it‚Äôs manageable, and then you won‚Äôt spend a bunch of time rewriting it later. And just spread that throughout your whole business. Make it simple to begin with. Make it manageable.</p>
<p>Use the right tools. Use quality tools that get the job done, and treat your customers with respect. It goes a long way when people actually get a nice quality response and conversation out of something.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Just talking themes</h3>
<p>I‚Äôve tried to summarize much of Mike‚Äôs story in this post, as I‚Äôve done with <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft/">other interviews</a>. However, we spent around 50 minutes talking about the ins and outs of WordPress themes, business, and other things. It was one of the most fun and laid back interviews I‚Äôve ever had the privilege of conducting.</p>
<p>I hope that you listen to the entire thing, and I hope that you enjoy it. I love doing these, and I hope to keep bringing them to you. That said, I‚Äôd also really appreciate any feedback readers and listeners have as to how I can make these posts better.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mike for joining me for this interview, and everyone be sure to check out his excellent new adventure, <a href="https://array.is">Array</a>.</p>

      <title>Pantheon for WordPress: a website hosting and management platform</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pantheon-wp-752x276.jpg" alt="pantheon-wordpress" /> <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com">Pantheon</a> is a website development, deployment, and hosting platform. But they aren‚Äôt just any host. They like to think of their product as a hosting killer, because in their mind, they do much more than just hosting.</p>
<p>I heard about Pantheon for the first time last year, when it was a Drupal-only platform. When Pantheon announced last week that their platform would <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com/wordpress">now support WordPress</a>, I knew I had to check it out.</p>
<p>I spoke with Josh Koenig, one of the <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com/about/team">co-founders of Pantheon</a>, and the Head of Developer Experience for the company. You can listen to our entire half hour conversation here:</p>
<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/PostStatus/DraftPodcast/pantheon-josh-koenig-post-status-draft.mp3">http://s3.amazonaws.com/PostStatus/DraftPodcast/pantheon-josh-koenig-post-status-draft.mp3</a></p>
<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/PostStatus/DraftPodcast/pantheon-josh-koenig-post-status-draft.mp3">Direct Download</a></p>
<h3>How Pantheon works</h3>
<p>Pantheon markets itself <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com/how-it-works">differently than most hosts</a>. For one, they target developers. They think about developers all the way down to the way to pay for services; they have a feature for developers to invite a client to pay for a service they‚Äôre managing, versus a client needing to share access with their developer.</p>
<p>The way Josh describes Pantheon, it‚Äôs more like <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> than a traditional host in terms of how it runs. A Pantheon customer, like a Heroku customer, is on the exact same platform as every other customer. For scaling, Pantheon simply adjusts the number of containers that are running, similar to Heroku‚Äôs Dynos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The containerization is much more nimble and much more efficient than virtual machines are. ‚Ä¶ If you have a bunch of virtual machines that are all running websites, they‚Äôre probably all running the same server software, using the same libraries, but they‚Äôre doing many copies of that for every virtual machine, whereas we have one host endpoint and that can share all the common binaries, all the common libraries, for all the containers that are located there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Containers can spin up in ten or fifteen seconds, much faster than scaling your website from one type of hosting (like a shared environment) to another (like a VPS) with a traditional host.</p>
<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pantheon-graphic-752x330.png" alt="How Pantheon compares their platform to traditional hosts" /></p>
<p>How Pantheon compares their platform to traditional hosts</p>
<h3>¬†Using Pantheon</h3>
<p>Every new user gets two development environments with Pantheon for free. To begin, it asks you to start a new project or import a site. I was able to easily download my files and database into one zip file from WP Remote, and I purposefully did nothing special to make it easier on Pantheon.</p>
<p>When I uploaded my backup, I was amazed that in around one minute, it had perfectly imported my site, extracted and connected the database, edited my config file for the Pantheon setup, and my development website was ready to go.</p>
<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pantheon-dashboard-752x413.png" alt="pantheon-dashboard" />There were some UX things with the dashboard that were a little weird to me. It took me a few minutes of digging around and figuring how where and how to do things. But once I got the hang of it, I could see how I could easily get used to a system like this.</p>
<p>As far as developing with Pantheon, you can work locally very easily, as their dev sites come setup as a Git repository and the Git clone URL is ready and waiting from the start. Or a developer can quickly grab SFTP connection details from the dashboard and edit their site straight in the development environment.</p>
<p>Once you are happy with your website, Pantheon makes pushing to testing and live servers easy, right from the dashboard.</p>
<p>Pantheon also has a paid feature called MultiDev, which allows for Git branching through the dashboard to quickly create entirely new installs for testing, training, feature building, etc. From a branch, users can then merge the code back to the main site through the dashboard.</p>
<h3>Is Pantheon different from other Managed WordPress hosts?</h3>
<p>I was curious how Pantheon is really different from a WordPress managed host like WP Engine, Pressable, or Pagely. They certainly aren‚Äôt marketing themselves as a managed host. They are trying to expand their marketability beyond that.</p>
<p>The way Josh describes it, what makes Pantheon different is the smoothness of the development workflow, with automatic and simple management of development, testing, and live environments.</p>
<p>Another item Josh highlights is that Pantheon allows for more than just WordPress websites. This is something I‚Äôd never really considered, because I‚Äôve never had a need beyond a WordPress website, but I can totally understand why a development shop that does both Drupal and WordPress work would really enjoy this.</p>
<p>Finally, Josh says that the smoothness of their scaling experience with their containers sets them apart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pantheon is one platform. Our biggest sites and our free sites all run on one coherent platform. So we really can say, ‚ÄòIf you can make it work on your free dev site and you like the performance you got there, we can scale that to millions of users and you won‚Äôt have to, like, go through a migration.‚Äô</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Josh said that they are pushing billions of pageviews per month on the platform right now, most of which are currently Drupal sites since the WordPress setup is so new.</p>
<p>While his statement about a single platform makes sense, I do think it‚Äôs more complicated than that. For one, it assumes the code quality is good. This is exactly why WordPress.com VIP reviews code before deploying to their system, even though it can also easily scale for large websites ‚Äî any large website needs quality code running. So I hope that Pantheon has a way to determine that, or plans to police plugins and code a bit, as other managed hosts have done.</p>
<p>Whether Pantheon is truly different from managed hosts like Pressable, WP Engine, and Pagely, I don‚Äôt know. I think that they are after a more developer-centered audience means their tools may evolve further beyond what other options offer.</p>
<p>However, they are an opinionated platform, just like other managed hosts. You won‚Äôt have cPanel and the things that come with it. Multisite could be a pain (or maybe not available, I‚Äôm not sure). You‚Äôll need a different solution for email. These things are fine, and they are what we‚Äôve come to understand as part of working with a managed host.</p>
<h3>Pricing for Pantheon</h3>
<p>Pantheon isn‚Äôt cheap, but it‚Äôs comparable to other managed hosts. They bill mostly on pageviews, though Josh notes it‚Äôs not a hard barrier (also consistent with how I know others work). The personal plan is $25 per month. Professional plans are $100 per month, with a $30 add-on for SSL. Their business plans scale to 1 million pageviews per month and dedicated phone support, for $400 per month.</p>
<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pantheon-pricing-752x360.jpg" alt="pantheon-pricing" /></p>
<p>In our conversation, we used my own site as an example. I have one site I really care about and am willing to pay a decent amount for hosting ‚Äî this one. Other than that, I manage a few small websites for friends and family.</p>
<p>In a situation like mine, Pantheon would probably not be my only host. With other managed hosts, I can easily tack on domains for lower priority sites, mixed in with my main website account. Though Josh did throw out some interesting ideas about how they might actually want to offer ‚Äúhobby‚Äù site hosting in the future, perhaps even for free ‚Äî further evidence for their developer target.</p>
<p>Additionally, as I noted earlier in the post, it‚Äôs easy to invite a client to pay for a new site, without having to use different credentials. Pressable has a similar setup for this, which I really enjoy.</p>
<h3>Is Pantheon a game-changer in WordPress website management?</h3>
<p>I think Pantheon is going to raise the bar for WordPress hosting. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll suddenly convert the tens of thousands of customers currently using various WordPress managed hosts, but I do think others will integrate some of the features (and marketing tactics) from Pantheon.</p>
<p>Also, Pantheon isn‚Äôt new to this. They have a team of 30, appear well funded, and have a couple of years of experience doing this with Drupal already under their belt.</p>
<p>I know it‚Äôs a bit lame to do so, but I think Andrew Nacin, a lead developer for WordPress, really nicely highlighted how Pantheon has targeted features that could help them gain serious traction in the WordPress development community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>. <a href="https://twitter.com/getpantheon">@getpantheon</a> has all the stuff I‚Äôd be looking for in a host: awareness of the application stack, focus on scaling, CLI access, rsync, etc.</p>
<p>‚Äî Andrew Nacin (@nacin) <a href="https://twitter.com/nacin/status/446642918531403778">March 20, 2014</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is for professional web developers doing professional web projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Josh said this toward the end of our interview. I think if they stick to this tactic and this marketing, <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com">Pantheon</a> could really do great.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pantheon-wp-752x276.jpg" alt="pantheon-wordpress" /> <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com">Pantheon</a> is a website development, deployment, and hosting platform. But they aren‚Äôt just any host. They like to think of their product as a hosting killer, because in their mind, they do much more than just hosting.</p>
<p>I heard about Pantheon for the first time last year, when it was a Drupal-only platform. When Pantheon announced last week that their platform would <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com/wordpress">now support WordPress</a>, I knew I had to check it out.</p>
<p>I spoke with Josh Koenig, one of the <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com/about/team">co-founders of Pantheon</a>, and the Head of Developer Experience for the company. You can listen to our entire half hour conversation here:</p>

<h3>How Pantheon works</h3>
<p>Pantheon markets itself <a href="https://www.getpantheon.com/how-it-works">differently than most hosts</a>. For one, they target developers. They think about developers all the way down to the way to pay for services; they have a feature for developers to invite a client to pay for a service they‚Äôre managing, versus a client needing to share access with their developer.</p>
<p>The way Josh describes Pantheon, it‚Äôs more like <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> than a traditional host in terms of how it runs. A Pantheon customer, like a Heroku customer, is on the exact same platform as every other customer. For scaling, Pantheon simply adjusts the number of containers that are running, similar to Heroku‚Äôs Dynos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The containerization is much more nimble and much more efficient than virtual machines are. ‚Ä¶ If you have a bunch of virtual machines that are all running websites, they‚Äôre probably all running the same server software, using the same libraries, but they‚Äôre doing many copies of that for every virtual machine, whereas we have one host endpoint and that can share all the common binaries, all the common libraries, for all the containers that are located there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Containers can spin up in ten or fifteen seconds, much faster than scaling your website from one type of hosting (like a shared environment) to another (like a VPS) with a traditional host.</p>

<p>How Pantheon compares their platform to traditional hosts</p>
<h3>¬†Using Pantheon</h3>
<p>Every new user gets two development environments with Pantheon for free. To begin, it asks you to start a new project or import a site. I was able to easily download my files and database into one zip file from WP Remote, and I purposefully did nothing special to make it easier on Pantheon.</p>
<p>When I uploaded my backup, I was amazed that in around one minute, it had perfectly imported my site, extracted and connected the database, edited my config file for the Pantheon setup, and my development website was ready to go.</p>
<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/pantheon-dashboard-752x413.png" alt="pantheon-dashboard" />There were some UX things with the dashboard that were a little weird to me. It took me a few minutes of digging around and figuring how where and how to do things. But once I got the hang of it, I could see how I could easily get used to a system like this.</p>
<p>As far as developing with Pantheon, you can work locally very easily, as their dev sites come setup as a Git repository and the Git clone URL is ready and waiting from the start. Or a developer can quickly grab SFTP connection details from the dashboard and edit their site straight in the development environment.</p>
<p>Once you are happy with your website, Pantheon makes pushing to testing and live servers easy, right from the dashboard.</p>
<p>Pantheon also has a paid feature called MultiDev, which allows for Git branching through the dashboard to quickly create entirely new installs for testing, training, feature building, etc. From a branch, users can then merge the code back to the main site through the dashboard.</p>
<h3>Is Pantheon different from other Managed WordPress hosts?</h3>
<p>I was curious how Pantheon is really different from a WordPress managed host like WP Engine, Pressable, or Pagely. They certainly aren‚Äôt marketing themselves as a managed host. They are trying to expand their marketability beyond that.</p>
<p>The way Josh describes it, what makes Pantheon different is the smoothness of the development workflow, with automatic and simple management of development, testing, and live environments.</p>
<p>Another item Josh highlights is that Pantheon allows for more than just WordPress websites. This is something I‚Äôd never really considered, because I‚Äôve never had a need beyond a WordPress website, but I can totally understand why a development shop that does both Drupal and WordPress work would really enjoy this.</p>
<p>Finally, Josh says that the smoothness of their scaling experience with their containers sets them apart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pantheon is one platform. Our biggest sites and our free sites all run on one coherent platform. So we really can say, ‚ÄòIf you can make it work on your free dev site and you like the performance you got there, we can scale that to millions of users and you won‚Äôt have to, like, go through a migration.‚Äô</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Josh said that they are pushing billions of pageviews per month on the platform right now, most of which are currently Drupal sites since the WordPress setup is so new.</p>
<p>While his statement about a single platform makes sense, I do think it‚Äôs more complicated than that. For one, it assumes the code quality is good. This is exactly why WordPress.com VIP reviews code before deploying to their system, even though it can also easily scale for large websites ‚Äî any large website needs quality code running. So I hope that Pantheon has a way to determine that, or plans to police plugins and code a bit, as other managed hosts have done.</p>
<p>Whether Pantheon is truly different from managed hosts like Pressable, WP Engine, and Pagely, I don‚Äôt know. I think that they are after a more developer-centered audience means their tools may evolve further beyond what other options offer.</p>
<p>However, they are an opinionated platform, just like other managed hosts. You won‚Äôt have cPanel and the things that come with it. Multisite could be a pain (or maybe not available, I‚Äôm not sure). You‚Äôll need a different solution for email. These things are fine, and they are what we‚Äôve come to understand as part of working with a managed host.</p>
<h3>Pricing for Pantheon</h3>
<p>Pantheon isn‚Äôt cheap, but it‚Äôs comparable to other managed hosts. They bill mostly on pageviews, though Josh notes it‚Äôs not a hard barrier (also consistent with how I know others work). The personal plan is $25 per month. Professional plans are $100 per month, with a $30 add-on for SSL. Their business plans scale to 1 million pageviews per month and dedicated phone support, for $400 per month.</p>

      <title>The evolution of 10up</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10up-logo-team-752x382.jpg" alt="10up-logo-team" />The ecosystem of businesses that have been built around WordPress is huge, but shallow. Few companies are both large (relatively speaking) and central to a broad WordPress community. With 60+ employees, some of which are very well-known WordPress developers, <a href="http://10up.com">10up</a> has quickly become a central figure in the WordPress world.</p>
<h3>Big WordPress companies with significant community influence</h3>
<p>Until recently, <a href="http://automattic.com">Automattic</a> has always been the primary example cited as a mature company in the WordPress space. But it‚Äôs hardly the only company using WordPress as a primary tool. <a href="http://envato.com">Envato</a> is similarly sized (just over 200 employees, and 50+ more this year), but Envato‚Äôs business spans well beyond WordPress themes and plugins on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.</p>
<p>A 60+ person team doing web consulting is not particularly unique either. There are loads of more traditional design agencies, ad agencies, and regional web firms that do a good bit of their business using WordPress.¬†But there aren‚Äôt very many companies in general, much less the size of 10up, that are so engrossed within the WordPress community.</p>
<p>Yet, as WordPress gains more and more traction as the CMS of choice for the web services and consulting industry, there are now WordPress focused service agencies that are growing quite rapidly. 10up leads this pack, despite being quite a young company; they just celebrated their 3 year anniversary.</p>
<h3>Meet John Eckman, 10up CEO</h3>
<p>10up Founder Jake Goldman has just <a href="http://10up.com/blog/john-eckman-ceo/">announced</a> that they‚Äôve hired a CEO, <a href="http://johneckman.com/">John Eckman</a>. The hire is representative of a new era for 10up, a company often analyzed by other agencies and professionals in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to be able to interview Jake and John together to talk about the announcement, a number of other topics around running 10up, and the WordPress ecosystem in general.</p>
<p>John Eckman is from the Boston area, and is an organizer of WordCamp Boston. Prior to his new role at 10up, he was the managing director of <a href="http://www.isitedesign.com/">ISITE Design</a>‚Äòs Boston office. John has experience working for and managing teams in a number of service companies over the years. He‚Äôs generally an open source advocate, with specific interests in Drupal and WordPress.</p>
<p>Jake and John met in 2009 during planning for WordCamp Boston. Jake has been thinking about bringing on a CEO for about a year and a half. Jake interviewed a number of candidates for the position, but specifically wanted someone with ties to the WordPress community, understanding of engineering disciplines, and experience managing teams within large web-based organizations.</p>
<p>This is the first interview Jake and John have done together. We talked about a number of things, largely around decision making and running a business.</p>
<h3>Mini 10ups within 10up</h3>
<p>One of the things I was interested in was the growing pains. If you are like me, you‚Äôve watched, flabbergasted, as 10up grew at an amazing rate. And Jake admitted that a significant¬†challenge has been realizing when architecture needs to change.</p>
<p>The company was mostly flat until they scaled beyond a dozen people. At that time, they established a leadership team, most of whom have now evolved into Vice President or Director roles. However, he also notes the early lesson they learned that great engineers don‚Äôt always make great team managers and mentorship doesn‚Äôt have to be exclusive to managers.</p>
<p>When they got to around 30 employees, they switched to a pod system, with pod leaders. Each pod has dedicated production employees, a pod leader that acts as a manager and lead strategist, and they are now introducing a ‚Äúproducer‚Äù role to help the pod leader manage day to day managerial duties.</p>
<p>From what I could glean from the conversation, a pod within 10up basically functions like its own little agency, with each pod handling a variety of projects. The design pod, however, is independent from the others. 10up is better known for programming and implementation than design ‚Äî something they are working to change ‚Äî and currently the design pod acts more like an outsourced element from each pod on a per-project basis as needed.</p>
<h3>Turnaround projects and managing cashflow</h3>
<p>I was curious about cashflow and managing clients when you have a lot of teams. If 10up was only doing new projects and not maintaining relationships longer term, it seems like it would be difficult to constantly manage everyone‚Äôs time.</p>
<p>While they didn‚Äôt downplay these challenges, both Jake and John highlighted how recurring revenue from large customers and also engaging customers beyond ‚Äúpositioning yourself as a coder‚Äù and simply doing what is asked. He notes that those who do so set themselves up for short term clients, and instead 10up offers advice for engaging a client long term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In those early phases, bring value, bring strategy, bring ideas that help them build their business; to show that you‚Äôre a partner that has business solutions, right, that you create those kind of relationships. It‚Äôs why we call everybody at 10up engineers, instead of developers. Because the definition of an engineer is not a coder or a programmer; it‚Äôs somebody that builds a solution for a problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those looking to get into these types of relationships, John advises to begin in the proposal phase, by introducing ideas and showcasing the experience the client would be buying, versus simply showing deliverables of your proposal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You‚Äôre essentially selling a point a view. You‚Äôre bringing a consultative guidance to them on how things ought to operate. And as long as they‚Äôre hearing that value, they‚Äôll be excited for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jake estimates that between 60 and 70 percent of their business is reliably repeat business and another portion of their business is repeat business that was less planned. They are able to categorize these projections as expected repeat customers and not have to worry as much about constantly finding new work to make payroll every month.</p>
<p>As far as the size of projects, they like to take on large projects, which helps reduce churn, but they also like to stay open to smaller projects that excite them.</p>
<p>Jake didn‚Äôt exactly highlight what their ‚Äúfloor‚Äù is, but he did use $5,000 as an example of the type of budget that sometimes comes in and is usually unrealistic for them.</p>
<p>He also noted that they have some accounts that have spent over $1 million with them in a year, and ‚Äúdefinitely‚Äù some that have spent that amount over the life of the project.</p>
<p>These long term, higher value clients rarely spend the money they do because of WordPress specifically, but rather consider 10up a partner to their web presence. And ¬†these longer term and higher dollar projects are what enable them to more effectively manage their team.</p>
<h3>How big will 10up grow to be?</h3>
<p>When I asked the inevitable question of just how big 10up would grow to be, Jake responded the way he says he always does. ‚ÄúMy reply to that is always, ‚Äòas big as it can be while we do great work.‚Äô To me the number of people is actually irrelevant.‚Äù</p>
<p>Adding to that, John notes, ‚Äúgrowing does enable us to have more impact in places we want to have more impact.‚Äù The impact he‚Äôs referencing is to push into markets like ‚Äúgovernment, higher ed, the enterprise,‚Äù but also cites that it‚Äôs important for them to do so ‚Äúwithout sacrificing culture or quality.‚Äù</p>
<h3>Bringing in CEOs in tech companies</h3>
<p>There is some precedent for a founder of a tech company to bring in a CEO. Outside of WordPress, the examples are many; even within the WordPress world, there are a few worth noting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matt Mullenweg brought in Toni Schneider to be the CEO of Automattic in 2006; and at the beginning of this year they actually <a href="https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-now-automattics-ceo/">switched jobs</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://poststatus.com/wp-engine-rebrands-restructures/">In October 2013</a>, WP Engine CEO Jason Cohen stepped down into a CTO role, and hired Heather Brunner to be CEO.</li>
<li>Not exactly the same, but in November of 2013, <a href="https://poststatus.com/crowd-favorite-acquired-velomedia/">VeloMedia acquired Crowd Favorite</a>, and Crowd Favorite founder Alex King became the CTO ‚Äî a role he felt more comfortable in.</li>
</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs very impressive to me when a founder relinquishes a level of control and brings in a CEO to help steer a ship they‚Äôve made such great efforts to build. I think in the instances I cite above the changes have been hugely successful for each company, and we‚Äôve seen them all continue to grow and do a lot of impressive things since.</p>
<h3>What will things look like three years from now?</h3>
<p>I do hope you watch the full interview with Jake and John. I think it‚Äôs very valuable for anyone interested in the business of WordPress, or want to know what life is like inside a company like 10up.</p>
<p>I haven‚Äôt gone into some of the topics we discussed at all, such as their <a href="https://poststatus.com/pushup-offers-push-notification-integration-wordpress-mac-os-x/">stepping into the product business</a>.</p>
<p>It amazes me just how fast our space is evolving. The ‚Äúold‚Äù companies in the WordPress world aren‚Äôt even ten years old; WordPress itself hardly is.</p>
<p>A slew of companies are doubling (at least) in size every year.</p>
<p>Traditional web agencies around the world are abandoning proprietary software and advertising their WordPress chops ‚Äî because their customers demand it.</p>
<p>Businesses that have historically just done services are getting into products.</p>
<p>It seems almost everyone is hiring.</p>
<p>The culture of work <a href="https://poststatus.com/year-without-pants/">is being disrupted</a>.</p>
<p>With all of these incredible shifts, it‚Äôs almost not surprising that a company like 10up could go from 1 to 60+ in three years, gaining a stellar reputation along the way. But it doesn‚Äôt stop it from being impressive.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt wait to see what the landscape looks like three years from now, to see how existing companies continue to evolve. And most of all I‚Äôm excited to see how many other entrepreneurs enter the fray between now and then and how they change the conversation again.</p>

<p>In those early phases, bring value, bring strategy, bring ideas that help them build their business; to show that you‚Äôre a partner that has business solutions, right, that you create those kind of relationships. It‚Äôs why we call everybody at 10up engineers, instead of developers. Because the definition of an engineer is not a coder or a programmer; it‚Äôs somebody that builds a solution for a problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those looking to get into these types of relationships, John advises to begin in the proposal phase, by introducing ideas and showcasing the experience the client would be buying, versus simply showing deliverables of your proposal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You‚Äôre essentially selling a point a view. You‚Äôre bringing a consultative guidance to them on how things ought to operate. And as long as they‚Äôre hearing that value, they‚Äôll be excited for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jake estimates that between 60 and 70 percent of their business is reliably repeat business and another portion of their business is repeat business that was less planned. They are able to categorize these projections as expected repeat customers and not have to worry as much about constantly finding new work to make payroll every month.</p>
<p>As far as the size of projects, they like to take on large projects, which helps reduce churn, but they also like to stay open to smaller projects that excite them.</p>
<p>Jake didn‚Äôt exactly highlight what their ‚Äúfloor‚Äù is, but he did use $5,000 as an example of the type of budget that sometimes comes in and is usually unrealistic for them.</p>
<p>He also noted that they have some accounts that have spent over $1 million with them in a year, and ‚Äúdefinitely‚Äù some that have spent that amount over the life of the project.</p>
<p>These long term, higher value clients rarely spend the money they do because of WordPress specifically, but rather consider 10up a partner to their web presence. And ¬†these longer term and higher dollar projects are what enable them to more effectively manage their team.</p>
<h3>How big will 10up grow to be?</h3>
<p>When I asked the inevitable question of just how big 10up would grow to be, Jake responded the way he says he always does. ‚ÄúMy reply to that is always, ‚Äòas big as it can be while we do great work.‚Äô To me the number of people is actually irrelevant.‚Äù</p>
<p>Adding to that, John notes, ‚Äúgrowing does enable us to have more impact in places we want to have more impact.‚Äù The impact he‚Äôs referencing is to push into markets like ‚Äúgovernment, higher ed, the enterprise,‚Äù but also cites that it‚Äôs important for them to do so ‚Äúwithout sacrificing culture or quality.‚Äù</p>
<h3>Bringing in CEOs in tech companies</h3>
<p>There is some precedent for a founder of a tech company to bring in a CEO. Outside of WordPress, the examples are many; even within the WordPress world, there are a few worth noting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matt Mullenweg brought in Toni Schneider to be the CEO of Automattic in 2006; and at the beginning of this year they actually <a href="https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-now-automattics-ceo/">switched jobs</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://poststatus.com/wp-engine-rebrands-restructures/">In October 2013</a>, WP Engine CEO Jason Cohen stepped down into a CTO role, and hired Heather Brunner to be CEO.</li>
<li>Not exactly the same, but in November of 2013, <a href="https://poststatus.com/crowd-favorite-acquired-velomedia/">VeloMedia acquired Crowd Favorite</a>, and Crowd Favorite founder Alex King became the CTO ‚Äî a role he felt more comfortable in.</li>
</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs very impressive to me when a founder relinquishes a level of control and brings in a CEO to help steer a ship they‚Äôve made such great efforts to build. I think in the instances I cite above the changes have been hugely successful for each company, and we‚Äôve seen them all continue to grow and do a lot of impressive things since.</p>
<h3>What will things look like three years from now?</h3>
<p>I do hope you watch the full interview with Jake and John. I think it‚Äôs very valuable for anyone interested in the business of WordPress, or want to know what life is like inside a company like 10up.</p>
<p>I haven‚Äôt gone into some of the topics we discussed at all, such as their <a href="https://poststatus.com/pushup-offers-push-notification-integration-wordpress-mac-os-x/">stepping into the product business</a>.</p>
<p>It amazes me just how fast our space is evolving. The ‚Äúold‚Äù companies in the WordPress world aren‚Äôt even ten years old; WordPress itself hardly is.</p>
<p>A slew of companies are doubling (at least) in size every year.</p>
<p>Traditional web agencies around the world are abandoning proprietary software and advertising their WordPress chops ‚Äî because their customers demand it.</p>
<p>Businesses that have historically just done services are getting into products.</p>
<p>It seems almost everyone is hiring.</p>
<p>The culture of work <a href="https://poststatus.com/year-without-pants/">is being disrupted</a>.</p>
<p>With all of these incredible shifts, it‚Äôs almost not surprising that a company like 10up could go from 1 to 60+ in three years, gaining a stellar reputation along the way. But it doesn‚Äôt stop it from being impressive.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt wait to see what the landscape looks like three years from now, to see how existing companies continue to evolve. And most of all I‚Äôm excited to see how many other entrepreneurs enter the fray between now and then and how they change the conversation again.</p>

      <title>Interview with Drew Strojny, Founder of The Theme Foundry</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/drewstrojny.png" alt="drewstrojny" />I had the pleasure to interview Drew Strojny, founder of <a href="http://thethemefoundry.com">The Theme Foundry</a>, about their work at The Theme Foundry, their philosophies about themes, and their latest theme release, <a href="https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/oxford/">Oxford</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/PostStatus/DraftPodcast/Post-Status-Draft-3-Drew-Strojny-ThemeFoundry.mp3">http://s3.amazonaws.com/PostStatus/DraftPodcast/Post-Status-Draft-3-Drew-Strojny-ThemeFoundry.mp3</a></p>

<p>Drew is a former Duke football player that spent a few years in the NFL before he started a small business doing general marketing. Over time, his clients started asking for websites, so he discovered WordPress. His work with web projects led him to start designing WordPress themes, and he ended up being an early player in the commercial theme market in 2008.</p>
<h3>Competition with themes over time</h3>
<p>In 2008, there weren‚Äôt many people selling themes. Chris Pearson was selling Thesis, Brian Gardner was selling Revolution, pre-Genesis. WooThemes was just underway. But the demand was enormous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, I thought we‚Äôd just throw our hat into the ring and try a design and see how it goes, and we got a really huge response.</p>
<p>It was really great timing on our part. It was one of the best times to get into the theme market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The WordPress theme space really exploded for a few years. Drew notes that they haven‚Äôt seen the explosive growth in the past couple years compared to the first two</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market is maturing and there are a lot more companies in the space, and a lot more options.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Setting themselves apart</h3>
<p>I asked Drew how The Theme Foundry sets themselves apart from the competition, considering just how many theme providers there are now. They like to tout their ‚Äúworld class design and clean code‚Äù when they market their themes.</p>
<p>They do most of their design in house, but they also commission some designs to get outside the bubble of the ‚ÄúWordPress theme‚Äù concept, and those commissioned themes help them expand their work.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/">John Hicks</a> designed <a href="https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/shelf/">Shelf</a>. <a href="http://ryan.is/">Ryan Essmaker</a> designed the <a href="https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/anthem/">Anthem</a> theme, <a href="http://foundationsix.com/">Dave Ruiz</a> designed the <a href="https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/avid/">Avid</a> theme, and most recently <a href="https://twitter.com/vpieters">Veerle Pieters</a> designed the <a href="https://poststatus.com/collections-theme-review/">Collections</a> theme.</p>
<p>The Theme Foundry notably doesn‚Äôt use any form of framework and attempts to limit theme options as much as possible.¬†When they sell a theme to a customer, they want it to ‚Äújust work‚Äù and be reliable over time.</p>
<h3>The impact of selling themes on WordPress.com</h3>
<p>The Theme Foundry was one of the first providers invited to sell commercial themes on WordPress.com. They released the Shelf theme in early 2011, and today nearly their entire <a href="http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/by/the-theme-foundry/">collection is available</a>.</p>
<p>However, WordPress.com wants as many great themes in the marketplace as possible, so over time the overall impact WordPress.com plays on The Theme Foundry‚Äôs business has been reduced, but it‚Äôs still an important part of what they do.</p>
<h3>Making big splashes with themes</h3>
<p>The Theme Foundry has made a number of big splashes in the theme market. Shelf, at the time, was an innovative theme, making use of post formats and responsive design when hardly anyone was doing it. Collections has a single page app (SPA) feel, using Backbone for loading pages, and Basis has a drag and drop builder that <a href="https://poststatus.com/basis-business-theme-intuitive-content-builder/">made a lot of waves</a>.</p>
<p>Drew says that they don‚Äôt like to just put out themes, but prefer to create themes that target a specific concept, and then build the theme to fit well into that concept, without bloating the theme with unnecessary functionality.</p>
<h3>Oxford theme and Typekit integration</h3>
<p><img src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/oxford-theme.png" alt="oxford-theme" /></p>
<p>Their latest theme is another that‚Äôs ready to make a splash. To date, no theme company has automated <a href="https://typekit.com/">Typekit</a> integration; as in, if a theme customer currently wants to use Typekit fonts, they need a separate account for it.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/oxford/">Oxford</a>¬†( <a href="http://demo.thethemefoundry.com/oxford-theme/">demo</a>), The Theme Foundry is including Typekit support, without a Typekit account, as part of the yearly licensing deal. What this means, is that Oxford offers the theme plus the Typekit font integration, for $79. And the yearly renewal fee is reduced to $39 for support, updates, and a continued Typekit font license.</p>
<p>The Typekit integration is the first of its kind in the WordPress theme landscape. To date, it‚Äôs a world limited by Google web fonts for hosted custom font integrations. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with Google web fonts, but Typekit is certainly a level up, and I‚Äôm excited to see this happen.</p>
<p>All of The Theme Foundry‚Äôs themes will be integrated with Typekit over the coming weeks. You can read more on their <a href="https://thethemefoundry.com/blog/oxford-typekit/">announcement post</a>.</p>
<h3>The Theme Foundry, Post Status, and what‚Äôs next</h3>
<p>Drew and I had a fifty minute convesation discussing the topics above and much more. We also spent some time talking about advertising, content marketing, and The Theme Foundry‚Äôs partnership with Post Status. If you‚Äôre interested in our relationship and Drew‚Äôs motivation for supporting what I do, I hope you‚Äôll give this interview a listen.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to talk to Drew, and I look forward to seeing what The Theme Foundry has coming next.</p>
