<h2><a id="introduction" name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p><img alt="Arboretum trees" src="/mime/media/75/2551/Arboretum-trees_Yau.jpg" style="float:left; height:312px; margin:5px; width:446px" />The General Education&#160;program at Cal State Fullerton is the basis of a university education. It is the foundation upon which each and every major is built. The goal of the campus is to provide a well-rounded citizen, not only of the region and the nation, but of the world as well. Thus, this broad-ranging curriculum has been carefully designed to ensure that every graduate is exposed to current thinking and scholarship that will provide a lifetime of appreciation of the liberal arts and sciences, as well as the ability to grow intellectually, ethically, morally and technologically.</p>

<p>All students who graduate from Cal State Fullerton must complete 48-49 semester units of general education courses selected in accordance with the pattern designated on the following pages. General education courses must be selected from an approved list. Students should refer to their individual Titan Degree Audit to see a list of approved courses in each GE category. A student who has a break in enrollment for more than one semester in any calendar year may be held to new catalog requirements.</p>

<p>CSUF students may complete lower-division general education requirements at a community college. In choosing equivalent courses, students must follow the CSUF general education&#160;plan and not the plan of the community college. Questions can be directed to the CSUF Academic Advising Center, Gordon Hall 123B.</p>

<p>During the first academic year, unless the requirement has been completed, students shall enroll in G.E. Area A.1, Oral Communication, G.E. Area A.2, Written Communication, and G.E. Area B.4, Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning&#160;courses appropriate to their major and skill level.</p>

<h2><a id="titan-degree-audit" name="titan-degree-audit"></a>Titan Degree Audit</h2>

<p>The Titan Degree Audit&#160;serves as the official advising tool for both students and academic advisers. The report provides information on student progress toward&#160;the completion of general education, major and other degree requirements, and will follow the student&#8217;s progress from admission to graduation. Visit <strong><a href="http://fullerton.edu/aac" target="_blank">fullerton.edu/aac</a></strong> for instructions on accessing the TDA and the Titan Advising Network.</p>

<h2><a id="general-education-requirements" name="general-education-requirements"></a>General Education Requirements</h2>

<h4>Unit Requirements</h4>

<p><em>48-49 total units including:</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Nine units upper division (300-level or 400-level courses)&#160;in designated areas B.5, C.3 and D.3&#160;should&#160;be taken as a junior or senior at a CSU campus</li>
	<li>Three units in cultural diversity (courses marked with an asterisk *)</li>
	<li>Each course counts in only one G.E. Area, except those meeting Overlay Z, Cultural Diversity&#160;or those in Area B that may combine the lab (B.3) within the B.1 or B.2 course</li>
</ul>

<h4>Academic Standards</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Letter grade required</li>
	<li>C-&#160;(1.7) or better required in G.E. Areas A.1, A.2, A.3 and B.4. Thus, a grade of D+ (1.3) is not sufficient to fulfill these requirements</li>
	<li>CR/NC is&#160;allowed if it is the only grade option available</li>
</ul>

<h4>Courses in Your Major</h4>

<ul>
	<li>G.E. approved courses offered by the department of the student&#8217;s major may be used to fulfill both&#160;G.E. and degree&#160;unit requirements.</li>
	<li>Upper-division G.E. courses are not applicable for graduate degree credit.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Transfer Students</h4>

<p>There are two General Education-Breadth patterns that California community college students can complete.</p>

<ol start="1">
	<li><em>CSU General Education-Breadth Program</em><br />
	This program is a lower-division, 39-semester-unit pattern. Students must take specified courses in five specific areas. Students with full certification are required to complete nine semester units of upper-division general education consisting of a minimum of three semester units each in Area B, C&#160;and D within the CSU after transferring to CSUF.<br />
	&#160;</li>
	<li><em>Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum</em><br />
	All lower-division Cal State Fullerton G.E. requirements may be satisfied by the completion in its entirety of this transfer curriculum at a California community college. Information about IGETC is available at each campus. Upper-division G.E. requirements for IGETC-certified transfers are nine semester units of upper-division general education consisting of a minimum of three semester units each in Area B, C&#160;and D within the CSU after transferring to CSUF.</li>
</ol>

<p>For either pattern, a minimum of three units of a &#8220;cultural diversity&#8221; (identified with an asterisk *) course, if not met prior to transfer, is required. In addition, the U.S. History, Constitution&#160;and American Ideals areas are required for graduation and must be completed if not met prior to transfer. Using their student portal, students can access their Titan Degree Audit to get a summary of their G.E. requirements.</p>

<h3>CSUF General Education Plans</h3>

<h2><a id="associate-degrees-for-transfer" name="associate-degrees-for-transfer"></a><strong>Certification Policy</strong></h2>

<p>Under provisions of Title 5 and Executive Order 1100, accredited colleges and universities may certify the completion of part of the 48-49 units required in general education. Within the policy of the Board of Trustees, Cal State Fullerton will accept such certification of general education up to a maximum of 39 semester units, but may accept no more in general education than the number of units required in each area.</p>

<p>Transfer students who are certified in any area with fewer than the required units will be subject to additional units and will be permitted to take the additional units in upper-division areas.</p>

<h2><a id="associate-degrees-for-transfer" name="associate-degrees-for-transfer"></a>Associate Degrees for Transfer (AA-T/AS-T)</h2>

<p>The Student Transfer Achievement Reform Act (SB 1440) establishes a transfer Associate of Arts (AA-T) or Associate of Science (AS-T) degree for California Community College students and is designed to provide a clear pathway to the CSU degree major. It allows students to complete an associate&#8217;s degree while satisfying lower-division general education and major requirements for transfer at the same time.</p>

<p>It is important that students contact their local community college for information on meeting the requirements for a transfer AA-T or AS-T degree. Students who have completed an approved associate transfer degree program deemed &#8220;similar&#8221;&#160;to their Cal State Fullerton major are eligible to graduate in 60 units. The exact pathway to complete the specific major will depend on the specific AA/AS curriculum. The 60-unit graduation option will obviously not be possible if the student changes majors or elects to add any additional degree objective, such as a second major or minor. It is highly recommended students have a consultation with their department academic adviser or visit the Academic Advising office.</p>

<p>For more information, visit&#160;<strong><a href="http://admissions.fullerton.edu/prospectivestudent/transferdegree.php" target="_blank">admissions.fullerton.edu/prospectivestudent/transferdegree.php</a></strong>.</p>

<h2><a id="lower-division-transfer-patterns-by-major" name="lower-division-transfer-patterns-by-major"></a>Lower-Division Transfer Patterns by Major</h2>

<p>Lower-Division Transfer Patterns present potential transfer students with a set of &#8220;road maps&#8221; to follow that will ensure appropriate academic preparation for studies at CSU and decrease time to graduation once these students enter the CSU. The LDTP for each discipline or major has statewide as well as campus-specific components. The statewide component of the LDTP is appropriate for any CSU campus that offers the major and comprises general education coursework as well as some courses within the discipline. The campus-specific component identifies discipline-related coursework relevant to the major at the specific CSU campus where the student intends to transfer. Together these components for an LDTP will typically total at least 60 units, which is the number of units needed to transfer to CSUF as an upper-division student.</p>

<h2><a id="the-objectives-of-general-education" name="the-objectives-of-general-education"></a>The Objectives of General Education</h2>

<p>General education is central to a university education&#160;and should enhance students&#8217; awareness of themselves in a complex universe, drawing upon multiple points of view. As a result of the general education experience, students should acquire knowledge of diverse disciplinary and cultural perspectives and skill in comparing, contrasting, applying and communicating effectively these perspectives in tasks considered appropriate to particular courses.</p>

<p>The General Education program at Cal State Fullerton is divided into six&#160;major areas: A. Core Competencies, B. Scientific Inquiry and Quantitative Reasoning, C. Arts and Humanities, D. Social Sciences, E. Lifelong Learning and Self-Development and F. Ethnic Studies. Additionally, the General Education program includes one Overlay, Z. Cultural Diversity, that adds content but no additional units to designated general education courses.</p>

<p>Written communication, oral communication, critical thinking and mathematics/quantitative reasoning are essential components of the entire program of general education at Cal State Fullerton.</p>

<p>General education courses shall include student writing appropriate to the course. Writing in general education courses shall involve the organization and expression of complex data or ideas. Instructors shall provide careful and timely evaluations of writing so that deficiencies are identified and suggestions are offered for improvement on subsequent writing in the course. Evaluations of the student&#8217;s writing competence shall be used in determining the final course grade. When a student is enrolled in a combined lecture and laboratory course, the laboratory portion of the course may be used to satisfy the general education writing requirement.</p>

<p>No single course should necessarily be expected to pursue every objective specified for that course&#8217;s G.E. area or subarea, although each course should meet the preponderance of the learning objectives within that area or subarea, thus satisfying the spirit and intention of the learning objectives (i.e., the more objectives that a particular course addresses the more appropriate that course will be as a general education offering.) However, courses that satisfy Overlay Z, Cultural Diversity, must include all of the learning objectives.</p>

<p>Course syllabi for courses that meet general education requirements shall include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A statement of the specific general education requirement(s) that the course meets.</li>
	<li>A list of the learning objectives for the general education area or subarea in which the course carries credit.</li>
	<li>Courses in Oral Communication (A.1), Written Communication (A.2), Critical Thinking (A.3) and Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning (B.4) shall include a statement that &#8220;A grade of C- (1.7) or better is required to meet this general education requirement. A grade of D+ (1.3) or below will not satisfy this general education requirement.&#8221;</li>
	<li>A statement of how the general education writing requirement shall be met and assessed.</li>
</ul>

<p>General education courses may be taught in any modality (e.g., face-to-face, hybrid or completely online).</p>

<div>
<h4>A. Core Competencies</h4>
