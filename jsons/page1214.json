This initiative began in fall of 2014 and is sponsored by the Office of the Provost. The Chapman Diversity Project is comprised of eight advisory groups, five task forces, and a response committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                What types of projects do the groups work on?\n\n                                                \n\nSome projects that groups have worked on and accomplished include:\u00a0\n\nSupporting the start of a new Latinx and Latin American Studies Minor\u00a0\nAdvocacy for the establishment of a Veterans Resource Center and Director of Veterans Affairs\u00a0\nThe inclusion of free menstruation products in women's and gender neutral restrooms on campus\u00a0\nIdentification and expansion of prayer and meditation space at the Rinker campus\u00a0\nAdvocacy for increased physical accessibility in renovations and new building projects\u00a0\nCompletion of the Campus Pride Index assessing Chapman as an LGBTQ friendly school\u00a0\nMapping campus amenities that are useful for students who may be struggling financially including lockers, microwaves, refrigerators, and printers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                How do I know what group I should join?\n\n                                                \n\nMembers select groups depending on their interests, knowledge, experiences, and/or passions. All groups focus on advocacy, institutional change, dialogue, and community building around diversity and inclusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                How can I join?\n\n                                                \n\nYou can always reach us at cdp@chapman.edu if you have any questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                Can I join more than one group?\n\n                                                \n\nYes, you can join more than one group! The time commitment is up to you and your schedule, though the vast majority of CDP members are only a part of one group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                Do I have to be a part of the specific identity or community that the advisory group focuses on in order to participate?\n\n                                                \n\nNo. You are welcome to join any groups that you would like to join as long as there is currently space available in the group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                What is the time commitment to joining a group, and what are the expectations of group members? \n\n                                                \n\nMost groups meet once or twice a month and meetings are typically one hour long.\u00a0Group members can select projects to work on depending on their availability and schedules. Some groups have sub-committees that focus on a specific area (ex: programs, services, policies), and the sub-committees meet at times outside of the regular group meeting times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                Who is in the groups?\n\n                                                \n\nUndergraduate and graduate students, staff members, part-time and full-time faculty, administrators, and alumni typically compose the membership in each group. There are also local community members that are a part of the Community Task Force. Participation is voluntary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                What is the leadership structure like? Who leads meetings?\n\n                                                \n\nEach group typically has a student, staff, and faculty co-chair. Co-chairs are responsible for guiding dialogues at meetings to ensure there is a balance of voices in the room. Co-chairs also typically send out meeting agendas and minutes to the group and communications about special projects that groups/sub-committees may be working on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                What is the average meeting attendance like?\n\n                                                \n\nMeeting attendance can vary group to group and year to year. However, there are typically about 5-15 folks present at each meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                At what times do groups typically meet?\n\n                                                \n\nMeeting times are different for each group and co-chairs typically poll the group at the beginning of the term to find a time that may work best for the majority. Most groups meet once or twice a month and meetings are typically one hour long between the hours of 8am-5pm Monday through Friday. We recommend you reach out to the CDP co-chairs of the group(s) you are interested in joining for the most accurate meeting times.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                If I am interested in leading one of the groups, how does that process work?\n\n                                                \n\nIf you are interested in leading one of the groups, please connect with the current co-chairs of that group or email Kara Ward at karaward@chapman.edu for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                What events does the Chapman Diversity Project participate in?\n\n                                                \n\nThe Chapman Diversity Project participates in many on-campus events throughout the year and is open to collaboration opportunities.
