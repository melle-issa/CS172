Working in studios and shops\u2014including a well-equipped maker space for prototyping\u2014students form strong connections with a close-knit cohort of designers and engineers. Project-based work with faculty and practitioners expands connections and gives ample opportunity to interact with the world as it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nof\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nof\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nof\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nof\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nof\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nof\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nof\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nof\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\nof\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRISD + Brown\nStudents also benefit from the complementary strengths of RISD and Brown, neighboring world-class institutions on Providence's East Side. Close academic ties make it easy for students to broaden their knowledge through elective coursework and access to each campus\u2019 exemplary resources. The program also offers opportunities to collaborate with faculty mentors whose diverse expertise supports students in understanding and synthesizing the different perspectives and contexts they will encounter in practice. Iterating with intention, MADE participants create and refine work according to real-world needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Apply\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown UniversitySchool of Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmade@brown.edu\n\n\n\n\n\nRhode Island School of DesignDivision of Architecture + Design\n\n\n\n\nQuick Navigation\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Navigation\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe campaign for building on distinction\n\nGive To Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Brown University \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown University\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFor You\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Site Navigation\n\n\n\n\nMobile Site Navigation\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MADE Experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudios\n\n\n\n\nTrajectories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Site Only\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of Brown.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster of Arts in Design Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen details for Master of Arts in Design Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookmark this Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
