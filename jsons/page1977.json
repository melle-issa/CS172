This can be done by using aggressive force such as using items in the environment to throw at a shooter (fire extinguisher, chair, backpacks, etc.).\u00a0 This is a life/death situation in which your \u201csurvival mindset\u201d must take over!Additionally, the Department of Police Services will utilize redundant methods of communication to send emergency messages and updates via email, voicemail, text, social media posts and emergency signage.\n\n\n\nEvents \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Building Marshal Training \n\n\nWednesday, February 5, 2020 - 1:00pm to 3:00pm \n\n\n \n\nGeneral Building Marshal Training Read more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisaster Ready - Earthquake Preparation, Response, & Recovery\n\n\nTuesday, March 17, 2020 - 2:00pm to 3:30pm \n\n\n \n\nThis workshop will focus on what to do before, during, and after an earthquake to support personal and family safety.
