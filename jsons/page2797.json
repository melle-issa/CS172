The school has a rich history of academic excellence and social responsibility, and has a special unit for special needs students. The school offers both O-level and A-level courses, as well as vocational training and co-curricular activities. The school\u2019s official website is www.igangass.ac.ug.\nAs you enter the school, you are met by an inspirational monument with the words, \u201cSOARING TO GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP\u201d.\n\n\"SOARING TO GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP:\" Glad to visit @IgangaSS (girls) Secondary School today as part of ongoing preparations for this year's #WordCampJinja slated for Mon Sept 4th to Tue Sept 5th 2023. The theme for this year's conference is \"There is always more to learn!\" and among\u2026 pic.twitter.com/ewpVC2xV4Z\u2014 Mukalele Rogers (@mrogers4christ) April 5, 2023\n\nThe school is situated on a spacious and green campus, with modern facilities and equipment. The school has a computer lab, a library, a science lab, a sick bay (medical services), a sports field, and good dormitories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The school also has a very active ICT club, and one of the projects they\u2019ve worked on is a WordPress powered online store and mobile app entitled Lyta Store, enables online shopping and mitigates the challenge of heavy travel to school through enabling students to shop variety of school requirements ranging from personal utilities like Vaseline to scholastic materials like books and pens online from various suppliers to be found at school hence solving not only one problem, but also other related problems that come with reporting back to school. The website is available at lytastore.com.\n\n\nWatch presentation by Iganga Secondary School Students presenting during the 7th National Conference on Communications in Jun 2022\nThe school is about 35 km away from Jinja, the second-largest city in Uganda and the source of the Nile River. Jinja is known for its natural beauty and cultural diversity, as well as its adventure tourism and industrial development.
