Farmer is author of Bicycling beyond the Divide: Two Journeys into the West, which won the Barnes and Noble Discover Great New Writer\u2019s Award and was a Colorado Book Award finalist. Along with his book, Farmer has appeared in Hayden\u2019s Ferry Review, The Laurel Review, Quarter After Eight, and Isotope. Farmer also had a short story published recently, \u201cWhere We Land,\u201d which ran in the Summer 2013 issue of The Whitefish Review. Currently, Farmer is a Professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and teaches Creative Writing and a Film and Literature course that examines the short story in relationship to film adaptation.\nFarmer\u2019s first book, Bicycling beyond the Divide: Two Journey\u2019s into the West, is a beautifully woven piece of literature that seamlessly grounds its reader in time and place, allowing for us to follow him on his journey amongst the diverse population and ever changing physical and social landscapes that make up America, as well as the most difficult leg of the trip through his previous, current and projected self. But as we follow along with Farmer, we realize that part of the load he\u2019s carrying is us, the reader, whom he\u2019s placed on the handlebars of his Trek 520 and given us a firsthand view of the world as he sees it unfolding, opening our eyes to the world around us and forcing us to find ourselves within it:\nI looked up at the mountains now as I rode through the falling snow. The aspen trees that once covered the hillsides were gone. In their place stood condominiums packed together so tight, it was hard to tell if there were many buildings or just one, fortress-like and stretching for what seemed miles.\nWas it the world that had changed, or was it me? Now, during a time of heightened security, it was difficult to imagine that I would get away with camping on a resort town golf course. Terrorism and war. Civilian Minutemen with guns \u201cprotecting\u201d our southern border. It was a time when a government-issued color code was used to gauge our risk, and freedom itself was being reconfigured to fit the changes. A dosage of fear was fed to us daily. Vitamin or sugar pill, who could say? The news seemed gloomy, yet in 1985 the news had been of starving children, environmental degradation, crisis in the Middle East.\nAt twenty I had feared nothing.\nFrom this brief excerpt, we see how Farmer puts the physical surroundings into perspective with brief descriptive detail, yet leaves enough room for us to fill in the scenery with our own experiences of diminished vegetation and urban sprawl within our community. He paints a vivid picture of the social climate that we reside in, while reflecting on what it was like for him and all who were there in \u201985, prodding us to ask the very question he asks of himself: \u00a0\u201cWas it the world that had changed, or was it me?\u201d\nPlease join us for a wonderful evening with visiting author, Daryl Farmer. Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, our readings are free and open to the public.\nhttp://www.darylfarmer.com/\nBy Jeremy Wallace\n\n \n\nFebruary 24, 2014watershedcsuc CSUC, Daryl Farmer, Writer's Voice Reading Series\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll\n\nDiscuss\nGet Inspired\nGet Polling\nGet Support\nLearn WordPress.com\nTheme Showcase\nWordPress Planet\nWordPress.com News\n\n\nTopics\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nUpcoming Events No upcoming events\nArchives\n\nMay 2022\nMarch 2022\nMay 2020\nOctober 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nOctober 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nApril 2017\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nDecember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nApril 2014\nFebruary 2014\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nAugust 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\n\n \n\nFollow me on TwitterMy Tweets \n\n\n\n\nCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
