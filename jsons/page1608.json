We also need to take steps to support our personal well-being beyond our intellectual lives and accomplishments. Because we are recovering from the collective trauma caused by COVID-19 we require warmth, understanding, and patience. Students want to know that you care about them and, importantly, what kind of support they can expect from you. They want to know that you, too, are an imperfect human who experiences failure, setbacks, and disappointment. Mental health and well-being are top of mind now more than ever.\n\n \n\n\u00a0\nTo request print copies of the Stanford Red Folder, please send your requests here.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\nHow is Student Well-Being Now?\nSigns of Distress\nMental Health and Well-Being Resources\nResources\nStudent of Concern Form\n\nDownload the Red Folder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHow Is Student Well-Being Now?\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Challenges Are Students Experiencing Right Now?\nLoneliness and minimal social support.

Check in with and get to know students whenever you can to help build that trust. Try to create an ongoing sense of welcome and belonging. Ultimately, students want to know you care about them. Sometimes you will be able to sense that a student is struggling.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBelow are a few ways that signs of distress may show up.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \nHow to Respond When You\u2019re Concerned About a Student\u2019s Well-Being\n\nSay\u00a0what you see\n\n\nSay what you've noticed, and avoid making any judgments or assumptions. Sometimes you won\u2019t see any overt signs of distress, and yet you\u2019ll still be\u00a0 aware of many things happening in the world that are causing distress in students\u2019 lives.\n\n\n\"Hi _____, I just wanted to check in. I've noticed _____, and wanted to see if you want to talk about it.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nShow you\u00a0care\n\n\nShowing you care about a student's well-being can have a positive impact on their mental well-being, and increase the likelihood they seek help if needed.\nBuild trust. Ask what they need. The kind of support a student needs will change based on the context, and the only way to know what kind of support they need is to ask.\n\n\n\"I care about your well-being, so I just wanted to check in to see how you're doing. I want to know how I can be the most helpful for you.\"\n\n\nHear them out\n\n\nBe there to listen. Listen patiently as you try to understand where they're coming from, and take time to affirm their emotional experience. Your full presence in itself can be healing.\u00a0\nYour role is to be a warm, supportive presence for this student who is struggling. You\u2019re not there to fix anything or give unsolicited advice. Acknowledge difficult emotions, and instill hope that, with help, things can get better.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, that seems like a such a hard situation to be in, what has that been like for you?\u201d\n\n\nKnow\u00a0your role\n\n\nSafety first. Do not hesitate to call Public Safety (911) for help. Your safety, and that of our students and community, is our top priority.\nConsult. Share your concern with the Dean of Students Office, or call the Resident Director on-call, GLO Dean on-call, or CAPS for further consultation whenever you need. These resources can give you advice, or help take over a situation that has escalated and requires mobilization of many resources.\n\n\n\u201cI'm sorry you're going through this, and honored that you've been vulnerable with me....\u201d\n\u201cYour feelings and experiences are real, and things can get better\u2026.I want to help.\u201d\n\n\nConnect to help\n\n\nHelp them connect to resources. Students in distress may need help connecting with a resource. Showing them how to access a resource increases the likelihood that they actually do.\u00a0\nStudent of Concern Form:\u00a0To submit a non-urgent Student of Concern form to the Dean of Students Office, please visit: goto.stanford.edu/DOS-SOC-refer\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThank you for being so open with me.

I really think you may find ______ to be a very helpful and comforting resource. Their whole job is to support students through these very challenges.\n\u201cCan I help you connect with ______?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health and Well-Being Resources\nVisit the new Mental Health Resources at Stanford website for help navigating the many mental health and well-being resources at Stanford.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAccess an HTML version of the \"In Case of Emergency\" graphic at this link\u00a0\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAccess an HTML version of the \"Urgent Response Needed\" graphic at this link\n\n\n \n\n \n\nAccess an HTML version of the \"Non-Urgent Situation\" graphic at this link\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \nCR (Confidential Resource) is used below to identify resources that offer clinically confidential support.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \nResources\nStanford Resources\n(undergraduate and graduate students)\nCounseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) offers individual consults, skills workshops, process groups, seminars, psychiatry services, community referral resources, and crisis intervention.
