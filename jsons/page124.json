Children were running away from classroom work, jumping on and crawling under furniture, spitting, crying, being aggressive and using foul language. I learned of their extensive medical needs, and encountered people who misjudged both the students and staff for their actions. \nYet, through all of that, I felt extremely proud of my students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 progress at the end of the year when I watched them walk across the stage to receive their commencement certificates. It was at that ceremony that I told myself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is what I want to do with my life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce I chose my career, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure where to start. I turned to the Center for Careers in Teaching at Cal State Fullerton and learned about the Men of Color in Education program. It intrigued me that there were other male educators with whom I could converse and connect with in the field. \nTogether, we discussed representation within schools and communities, flaws of the school systems, how to address and change those flaws, and reflected on ourselves as individuals trying to make a difference in the lives of our future students.\nAfter I complete my teacher credential program, I want to continue my education with a master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree. The more knowledgeable I become, the better service I will be able to provide for my students and their families. I want to educate students \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where my heart is.Share Jonathan's StoryAbout the GiftThe Center for Careers in Teaching in the College of Education received a transformational gift from SchoolsFirst Federal Credit Union to support future teachers through outreach, advising, workshops, and teacher preparation programs like Titan Future Teachers and Men of Color in Education.Corporations have invested more than $34 million in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt Takes a Titan\u00e2\u0080\u009d campaign.It takes a Titan like youCal State Fullerton is the catalyst for Titan-sized transformations, inspiring students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 paths, launching careers and improving lives.
