Please activate your student portal as soon as possible and view your Tasks list before submitting transcripts.\u00a0\nApplicants are expected to submit an official transcript from every institution they have attended, even if they withdrew before completing a term and whether the courses are transferable. If you did not attend a school that is listed, an Official Letter of Non-Attendance is required to satisfy that Task list item.\u00a0\nOnly OFFICIAL College transcripts will be accepted.\n\nWhat are official transcripts?\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof\u00b7fi\u00b7cial\n\n\n\n/\u0259\u02c8fiSH\u0259l/\n\nAdjective\n\nOfficial documents are delivered securely from the originating institution directly to CSUF in an electronic format, or as a hard copy mailed in the institution's sealed envelope, not opened by the student, or anyone other than a CSUF Admissions staff member.\u00a0\nPlease Note: Final transcripts should include all grades and degrees earned, if applicable.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nElectronic Transcripts (see providers below)\nElectronic transcripts are preferred and can significantly expedite the processing time.\u00a0If sending transcripts from a school on the list below, it is preferred that\u00a0only electronic transcripts are submitted. If your school is not on this list, please refer to your college's transcript ordering website for available options.\nWhen ordering a transcript select \"California State University, Fullerton\" from the drop-down list. Please avoid selecting \"OTHER\" or manually entering email addresses. However, if your institution does not already have CSUF\u2019s contact information on file, please use admissions@fullerton.edu to complete your order.\nCSUF will also accept emailed PDF official college transcripts sent directly from National Student Clearing House and SCRIP-SAFE to admissions@fullerton.edu.\n\n\n\n\nTuffy Tip #1: If you are submitting official documents electronically, they must be requested with enough time to ensure they are received on or before the deadline. Electronic requests are not immediate, they require processing time from the institution you attended, so check with your institution and plan accordingly. Transcripts that are requested before a deadline but delivered after will be considered late.\u00a0\n\n\nTuffy Tip #2: Mistakes happen. Be really careful when choosing where you send your electronic transcripts. Sending documents to Fullerton College is a common mistake. So is sending electronic transcripts to your own email address rather than admissions@fullerton.edu. Take a moment to review your order for these common mistakes before submitting it.\n\u00a0\n\nSee the list of CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES that provide electronic transcripts below\n\n\n\n\n\nA to C\n\nAllan Hancock College\nAmerican River College\nBakersfield College\nBerkeley City College (Peralta Community College District)\nButte College\nCabrillo College\nCerritos College\nCerro Coso Community College\nChabot College\nChaffey College\nCoastline Community College\nCollege of Alameda (Peralta Community College District)\nCollege of Marin\nCollege of the Canyons\nCollege of the Desert\nCollege of the Redwoods\nCollege of the Sequoias\nContra Costa College\nCosumnes River College\nCrafton Hills College\nCuesta College\nCuyamaca College\nCypress College\n\n\n\n\n\nD to L\n\nDe Anza College\nDiablo Valley College\nEvergreen Valley College\nFolsom Lake College (Los Rios Community College District)\nFoothill College\nFullerton College\nGavilan College\nGolden West College\nGrossmont College\nImperial Valley College\nIrvine Valley College\nLake Tahoe Community College\nLaney College (Peralta Community College District)\nLas Positas College\nLassen College\nLong Beach City College\nLos Medanos College\n\n\n\n\n\nM to P\n\nMendocino College\nMerritt College (Peralta Community College District)\nMira Costa College\nMoorpark College (Ventura County College District)\nMount San Antonio College\nNapa Valley College\nOhlone College\nOrange Coast College\nOxnard College (Ventura County College District)\nPalo Verde College\nPalomar College\nPasadena City College\nPeralta Community College District\nPorterville College\n\n\n\n\n\nS to V\n\nSacramento City College\nSaddleback College\nSan Bernardino Valley College\nSan Diego City College (San Diego Community College District)\nSan Diego Mesa College (San Diego Community College District)\nSan Diego Miramar College (San Diego Community College District)\nSan Jose City College\nSanta Ana Community College (Rancho Santiago Community College District)\nSanta Barbara City College\nSanta Monica College\nSanta Rosa Junior College\nSantiago Canyon College (Rancho Santiago Community College District)\nSierra College\nSolano Community College\nSouthwestern College\nTaft College\nUniversity of Phoenix\nVentura College (Ventura County College District)\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadlines\nCSUF is a highly impacted campus. We receive far more eligible students than we can possibly accommodate. For this reason, deadlines, such as transcript deadlines are strictly enforced. It is solely the student\u2019s responsibility to assure that all required documents are received by the Office of Admissions on or before the deadline in order to finalize your conditional admission. Physical documents must be delivered on or before that date. Electronic transcripts must be transmitted on or before that date.\u00a0\nAll transcripts requests, even electronic ones, require processing times. Please contact each school you have attended and verify how far in advance a transcript request must be made. Transcripts that are requested before a deadline but delivered after will be considered late.\u00a0\n\nNote: Graduate applicants starting Fall 2023 will only need to submit official\u00a0transcripts from the college or university\u00a0from which their bachelor's degree was earned.\n\n\n\n\nPaper Transcripts\nIf at all possible, electronic transcripts are preferred and can significantly expedite the processing time. However, if your intuition does not offer electronic delivery, physical transcripts may be sent. Official transcripts must be delivered sealed in the original envelope to be considered Official.\nOfficial physical transcripts can be mailed to:\n\nCalifornia State University, FullertonOffice of AdmissionsP.O. Box 6900Fullerton, CA 92834-6900\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuffy Tip:\nIf possible, please legibly write your name and CSUF student ID (CWID) on the outside of the sealed envelope.\u00a0 Physical transcript requests are not immediate. They require processing time from the institution you attended, so check with your institution and plan accordingly. Transcripts that are requested before a deadline but delivered after will be considered late.\n\n\n\n\nExam Credit\nIf you have taken an external examination to satisfy a subject requirement (or for admission requirements), please review the following\u00a0 document\u00a0\u00a0\n\nfor minimum passing score, course equivalencies and units earned.\nOfficial Exam Scores must be issued by the appropriate issuing body (ex: College Board, TOEFL, IELTS, etc). Test scores that appear on transcripts will not be accepted for credit.\nSend your official exam credit to Cal State Fullerton using the school code\u00a04589.\n\n\nAdvanced Placement (AP)\u00a0\nrequest score\n\n\n\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB)\u00a0\nrequest transcript or certificate\n\n\n\nCollege Level Examination Program (CLEP)\u00a0\nrequest score\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuffy Tip:\nIf four or more years have lapsed since your AP examination, your scores will be archived. Please allow additional processing time when ordering.\nExam Credit needed to meet admission criteria is held to the same deadlines as transcripts. Scores that are requested before a deadline but delivered after will be considered late.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site is maintained by \n\t\t\t\t\t\tOffice of Admissions.\nLast Published 2/22/23\nTo report problems or comments with this site, please contact \n\t\t\t\t\t\tarwebmaster@fullerton.edu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 California State University, Fullerton.
