Additional information can be found under the\u00a0Graduate Program Forms and Deadlines page.\nAdditional Information\u00a0\nOnce your application has been received and entered, you will receive an email to your SSU e-mail account which will include important information and application confirmation. At this time, you will be instructed to review and/or update your diploma name and diploma mailing address.\nYou will not be cleared for graduation if there are any outstanding requirements showing in RED on your ARR.\n\nYou may submit your preferred diploma name and address\u00a0online\n\nLate applications will automatically be posted for the next eligible graduation term.\nOther questions? See the Graduation FAQ\nAre You on Track for Graduation?\nYour ARR determines graduation eligibility. Use your ARR to track your graduation requirements and review your graduation status. Be sure to check your ARR for accuracy and report any errors to your advisor.\u00a0\nYou can access your ARR on your MySSU account.\u00a0Go to the Reading ARR instructions page\u00a0for more help.\nYou will not be cleared for graduation if there are any outstanding requirements showing in RED or YELLOW at the time degrees are awarded for the term.\nStudents who have not attended SSU for more than 2 semesters\nStudents not in a period of continuous enrollment at the time of filing for their degree must meet the catalog requirements in effect at the time of filing.\n\nFill out a Graduation Matriculation Form.\n\n\nFill out an Undergraduate Application or Graduate Application as appropriate.\u00a0\n\n\nMeet with your advisor to review the current graduation requirements and determine what, if any, additional coursework you may need to take.\n\n\nSubmit your signed Graduation Application and Graduation Matriculation forms to the Office of the Registrar by the posted deadlines.\n\n\nFor students who have been separated for 5 years or more, you will need to resubmit ALL transcripts from ALL colleges/universities attended.\n\nCourse Substitution - Helpful Hints\nRQ number \u00a0Include the complete RQ number (example: XXX-XX ).\nExplanation \u00a0Include the exact 'heading' of the requirement being met (there may be multiple requirement headings under the same RQ number). Include as much detail as possible, as this will allow for fast processing and will help avoid delays in having to return the form to get the necessary information.\nInternational Program (IP) Courses \u00a0Include the full course topic/title as it appears on the transcript (example: 'American Art: 1960's Era').\nTransfer Courses \u00a0Verify that the transfer course covers the required units,\u00a0otherwise you will need to apply another course to make up for the remaining overall units.\nPlease Note: Substitutions for transfer and IP courses cannot be processed until the official transcript has been received and posted to the student's record.\nCommencement\nWhat's the difference between graduation and commencement? Graduation is the actual academic semester, or term, in which you officially and successfully complete\u00a0all of your graduation requirements.\u00a0You must apply for the term in which you plan to graduate.\u00a0Once grades are posted, your record will be evaluated and if all requirements are met, your degree will be awarded.\nThe commencement ceremony is often referred to as 'graduation',\u00a0but in reality there is a difference.\u00a0 Commencement is a ceremony and celebration for students who are projected to successfully complete all of their graduation requirements by the end of spring semester or those that completed in the prior fall or upcoming summer semesters.\u00a0You will not receive a diploma at the commencement ceremony.\u00a0\nFor information on commencement ceremonies, please go to the commencement website.\nDegree with Honors\nDegree Honors:\u00a0 Criteria used to determine honors at graduation are those in effect as of the date of graduation.\u00a0 Students graduating with the baccalaureate earn degree honors by meeting the following criteria:\n\u00a0\u00a0 a.\u00a0 Completion of a minimum of 45 letter-graded semester units in residence; and\n\u00a0\u00a0 b.\u00a0 Attainment of cumulative and SSU grade point averages\u00a0as indicated below:\nSumma Cum Laude is awarded to those students achieving a cumulative grade point average in ALL university and college work and a cumulative GPA in all work undertaken at SSU of not less than 3.90.\u00a0\nMagna Cum Laude\u00a0is awarded to those students achieving a cumulative grade point average in ALL university and college work and a cumulative GPA in all work undertaken at SSU of not less than 3.75.\u00a0\nCum Laude\u00a0is awarded to those students achieving a cumulative grade point average in ALL university and college work and a cumulative GPA in all work undertaken at SSU of not less than 3.50.\u00a0\nFor the purposes of the commencement program, SSU utilizes data from the last graded semester (fall or spring) and does not calculate in coursework in progress.\u00a0 Final determination of honors will be determined at the time the degree is posted and, if applicable, will be listed on your diploma and official transcripts.\nFor further information regarding grades, guidelines and University statutes, please refer to the SSU Catalog.\nAdditional Information for Graduate Students\nFor All Graduate Students\nYou must apply to graduate by submitting the Master's Degree Graduation Application\u00a0to the Office of the Registrar.\n*Note: If you already applied for an earlier graduation date but didn't complete your requirements, you must reapply or submit a Graduation Changes Form.\nFor Those Completing a Thesis or Project\nSubmit your signed Completion of Requirements form (GS 02) along with the review copy of your thesis or project to the Graduate Studies Office (Stevenson 1041).\u00a0 Your thesis or project must have been publicly defended and approved by your committee prior to submitting to the Graduate Studies Office.\nFor those Completing with Other Culminating Experiences (Comprehensive Exam, Professional Papers, Cognate, Internships, etc.): Submit your signed Completion of Requirements form (GS 02) to the Graduate Studies Office (Stevenson 1041).\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistrar Home\nHow to Register\nDates & Deadlines\nEnrollment Policies\nForms & Petitions\nFamily Education Rights & Privacy Act (FERPA)\nGraduationGraduation FAQ\n\nTransfer Course Information\nHelp & How Tos\nTranscripts\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed Help? \nUse our Contact Form\nOffice of the Registrar\nSalazar Hall, Room 1071(707) 664-2778registrar@sonoma.edu\nHours\nMonday-Friday 8am-5pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSU Facebook\nSSU Twitter\nSSU Instagram\nSSU Youtube\nSSU News RSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Ave\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n707.664.2880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact SSU\nPrivacy Notice\nCalifornia State University\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSafeSSU\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\nEmergency Information\nJobs\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
