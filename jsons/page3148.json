Applying and enrolling at\u00a0California State University,Northridge\u00a0provides students access to a world-class education while empowering them to become the leaders and innovators shaping our community and world.\nMalachia Y. Hoover\nMeet CSUN Success Story Malachia Y. Hoover, who received her undergraduate and graduate degrees at CSUN, and is currently working towards a doctorate at Stanford University. The former Matador is a Ph.D. candidate at the Chan Laboratory Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine.\nWhat inspired you to apply and attend CSUN?\u00a0\n\u201cI come from the public housing projects in Marin City,\u00a0Calif., and when I began the application process for colleges, I knew that I could not afford to attend a UC or private institution. I took a college tour to CSUN, and I was amazed how diverse the student population was compared to other universities.\u201d\nHow did your CSUN experience help shape your life and career?\n\u201cMy experience at CSUN is what catapulted my pursuit of a graduate degree in biomedical research. It was during my undergraduate years that I gained my first research experience, and I received exceptional mentorship and guidance from my principal investigator, Dr. Jonathan Kelber, and programs such as MARC RISE [now known as the Undergraduate Student Training in Academic Research (U-RISE) program] and [The Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation\u00a0program]. After attaining my BS and master\u2019s at CSUN, I was highly prepared to perform research at the doctoral level. Currently, I am finishing my last year at Stanford in the\u00a0stem cell biology and regenerative medicine\u00a0program. I\u2019m excited for the next steps in my career and so proud to be a Matador alumnus!\u201d\nWhich CSUN class, program or event had the most impact on your life and how?\n\u00a0\u201cWhen I entered CSUN as a freshman, my declared major was\u00a0mathematics. I knew that I loved the STEM fields, but I was still unsure which discipline I liked most. It wasn\u2019t until I took biology, particularly physiology, that I knew exactly which major I wanted to pursue. Biology amazed and excited me as I learned the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control our body and health. I was fascinated how the cell \u2013 the smallest living unit of life \u2013 was capable of fueling and regulating the processes within our body and other forms of life. The field of biology continues to inspire me as I continue my studies at the graduate level in the field of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. The study and application of biology can reverse disease and stimulate regeneration to improve and save lives. This is what motivates me to pursue a career in biomedical research.\u201d\nWhich university resources did you utilize the most during your time at CSUN and how did it add to your college experience?\u00a0\n\u201cPursuing biomedical research in Dr. Jonathan Kelber\u2019s lab during my undergraduate and master\u2019s was pivotal in my college experience. Although I declared my major in biology, I was conflicted if I wanted to become a medical doctor and wanted to explore other career choices. I became involved in programs such as LSAMP and MARC RISE [now known as U-RISE], which supported minorities and research training and I immediately grew a passion for biomedical research. During my time in Dr. Kelber\u2019s lab, I began learning techniques and knowledge behind the mechanisms governing cancer and regeneration and became a scientist! It was amazing that I was able to explore new\u00a0hypotheses\u00a0in biology that had not been discovered. This curiosity and investigation of the unknown is what fueled my choice to become a research scientist.\u201d\nIs there something you learned during your time at CSUN you wish you could tell yourself as a first-year student?\n\u201cI would tell myself that you have a long tough journey ahead of you, pursuing such a degree in the STEM field, but you are capable of achieving all your dreams and aspirations! Others, and even at times yourself, will doubt that you can become a Black female scientist, but your passion and determination will take you to places you would have never imagined. Don\u2019t let the pitfalls and failures define you but let them motivate you to succeed.\u201d\nAre you ready to begin writing your own Success Story?
