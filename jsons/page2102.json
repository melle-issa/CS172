The Ombuds Office is also a good place to confidentially raise concerns or recommendations for systems-level change.\u00a0All meetings are kept strictly confidential and individuals remain in control of how they wish to address their concerns. There are two Ombuds Offices at Stanford. This office serves university members outside of the School of Medicine and the SOM Ombuds Office serves members of the community at the School of Medicine.\nCommunications with the Ombuds does not put Stanford on notice of the communication.\nRead more about how the Ombuds can help.\nUsed the Ombuds before?
