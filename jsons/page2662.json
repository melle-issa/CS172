All Stanford police officers are deputy sheriffs of Santa Clara County and exercise full law-enforcement powers to make arrests, enforce all applicable federal, state and local laws, and provide any other law enforcement services required.\nEach year, Stanford publishes and distributes a booklet in compliance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. The information in this booklet includes campus security programs, recommended personal safety practices, the authority of the university police and campus crime statistics for the most recent three-year period. Parents and guardians can obtain a copy online or by calling (650) 723-9633, e-mailing publicsafety@lists.stanford.edu, or writing the Stanford Department of Public Safety, 711 Serra Street, Stanford, CA 94305-7240, Attn: Crime Stats.\nEmergencies at Stanford\nStanford\u2019s emergency management program has been in place for many years. The emergency plan has evolved from one primarily focused on earthquake preparation and response to include an \u201call-hazards\u201d approach to emergency planning. As part of the program, which is a continuing process of planning, implementation, evaluation and revision, Stanford conducts exercises for different types of emergencies. Officers in the Department of Public Safety, who have full police powers, also drill frequently in preparation for emergencies.\nStanford\u2019s emergency website can be implemented immediately. That page will be the university\u2019s primary method of updating information for all of its various communities, including parents and guardians.\nThe university has the capacity to send out voice mails, mass e-mails and text notifications to students and employees through the AlertSU system. The AlertSU system includes a series of sirens throughout campus that can be activated in case of emergency. They are tested throughout the school year.\n \n\n\n\nStanford + Parents/Guardians\n The student is at the center \u2014 and is the focus \u2014 of this important partnership.\n\nOur Policy\nProspective Parents\n\n\n  \n\nParents' Helpline\n\nmykidis@stanford.edu\n650-725-0649\n \n\n\n  \n\nIn an Emergency\n\nemergency.stanford.edu\n650-725-5555\n 844-ALERTSU (844-253-7878)  \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Home\nMaps & Directions\nSearch Stanford\nEmergency Info\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy\nCopyright\nTrademarks\nNon-Discrimination\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University,  Stanford, California 94305.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n",
