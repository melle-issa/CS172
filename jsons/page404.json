They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party reviews by 1 July, 2023.\nI will be stepping down from plugin reviews this year. I have been a part of this team for over a decade (and the rep for the majority of the time) and recognize a departure like this can be confusing, and could cause people jump to a whole lot of assumptions about the why.\nThis is a personal decision and has nothing to do with my passion for WordPress. It is a 100% personal, non-WordPress related, decision I made long ago (I told the team in July \u201922). Suffice to say there is life \u2018stuff\u2019 going on and I cannot devote the time I once could to plugin reviews.\nMany people have noticed and complained, with varying degrees of empathy, about the sudden uptick in delays with reviews (be they new plugins or security related). Those delays are directly related to that \u2018stuff\u2019 going on. I simply am not available as much as I was, and out of fairness to myself and the community, it\u2019s time for me to retire from plugins.\nWe\u2019re trying to figure out an onboarding doc, some demo plugins to help people test, getting people in a place where they can fill in the gaps. But this is not a fast process. We\u2019ve actually never had real onboarding (I was thrown into the fire when I stepped in), and it\u2019s going to be a challenge get a team to the place where they have as much weird plugin knowledge and gotchas as I have from my 10 years of experience.\nThere will absolutely be a learning curve for the people who step in after me. Things will be missed, things will be confusing, and mistakes will happen. I ask everyone be kind and patient.\nI understand it became a one-woman show and I apologize for not asking for help and stepping down sooner before it became a crisis. At that point, it was impossible to set up a flag for help without causing these kinds of delays. But things like this happen out of your control, even when you plan. None of us expected the world to spiral like it did in 2019/20.\nWhat\u2019s next for me and WordPress? Writing and managing my plugins, developing code, and being around for some questions. I won\u2019t vanish in the night, but after a decade? I think it will be good for us all to have someone fresh in there.\nSome quick answers:\nI\u2019m not sick or dying. \nWe don\u2019t have an announcement of the new rep.\nWe are still working on onboarding and figuring that out.\nWe have reached out to people and they are actively being onboarded right now.\nSo again, I ask we all please be patient with all the changes coming. Once we sort out onboarding, we hope to be able to invite even more people, just like you, to the team!\n#announcement, #team-repsShare this:TwitterFacebookLogin to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracy Levesque\n\n6:16 pm on March 10, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nThank you for all the tireless work you\u2019ve given this project for a DECADE. \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Huff\n\n6:18 pm on March 10, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nThank you for all of the work you\u2019ve done here, Mika!\nYour leadership and attention to detail have been among the best across the entire WordPress project, and I look forward to the new Plugins Team living up to your example. \ud83d\ude42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodeBard\n\n6:21 pm on March 10, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nYou did a major contribution to Open SourceOpen Source Open Source denotes software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.

The community as a whole is grateful for the work you have done, and WordPress is better for it as well.   I\u2019m thankful that you\u2019ve obviously put a lot of thought into your transition out of the role.  It should make things much smoother for someone transitioning in.  \nOn a personal note, I have very fond memories of our first interaction at WordCampWordCamp WordCamps are casual, locally-organized conferences covering everything related to WordPress. They're one of the places where the WordPress community comes together to teach one another what they\u2019ve learned throughout the year and share the joy. Learn more. Raleigh when I finally got to put \u201ca name with a face\u201d and we had such a great conversation about Swedish Death metal and Saturday morning cartoons.  Seeing you from time to time at camps only cemented my respect for you and the work you have done for WordPress.   And over the last year especially you have been a welcome advocate for my own transition.  Your advice and ardent support have helped and encouraged me.  I cannot thank you enough for that.  \n<3\nMia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Hood\n\n9:11 pm on April 2, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nI sincerely appreciate your perseverance in handling this challenging situation solo for a considerable period of time.
