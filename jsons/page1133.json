If English is not the sole language of instruction listed or if no language is listed at all, the waiver does not apply and the applicant is required to take and pass an approved English proficiency test.\u00a0 Approved tests and minimum scores are outlined in the next section.\u00a0\u00a0\nPlease note: Test results that are two years old or older are not acceptable.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: If a student will be supported as a\u00a0Teaching Assistant (TA)\u00a0by their program, please read the\u00a0English proficiency requirement policy\u00a0for Teaching Assistantships.\u00a0Some programs require students who have not earned an undergraduate degree from an institution at which English was the sole language of instruction according to WHED to demonstrate English language proficiency to serve as a TA when they apply to the program. Please check with the\u00a0program(s)\u00a0to which you\u00a0intend to\u00a0apply for individual requirements.\nTOEFL\nThe TOEFL is administered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS).\n\nPlease select institution code\u00a04859\u00a0to have your official score sent to UCI. No department code is needed.\nWe only accept scores submitted electronically by ETS.\nTest results that are two years old or older are\u00a0not acceptable.\nWe do not accept\u00a0MyBest\u00a0scores; you must submit all individual test scores.\nResults of institutional (non-ETS) administrations of the TOEFL are\u00a0not acceptable.\nWe will accept the TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition test.\u00a0 The same minimum score applies.\nWe do\u00a0NOT\u00a0accept the TOEFL ITP Plus test for China or the TOEFL Essentials test.\nFor more information, please visit their website at\u00a0www.ets.org/toefl\n\nTOEFL Score Requirements for Admission Consideration:\n\nAn overall minimum score of\u00a080\u00a0\n\nIELTS\nAs an alternative to the TOEFL, you may submit scores from the Academic Modules of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS).\n\nWe only accept scores submitted electronically by the IELTS test center. No paper Test Report Forms will be accepted.\nTest results that are two years old or older are\u00a0not acceptable.\nWe will accept the IELTS Online and IELTS Indicator test.\u00a0 The same minimum score applies.\nAn institutional code is NOT required. Please contact the test center directly where you took the IELTS test and request that your test scores be sent electronically using the IELTS system. All IELTS test centers worldwide are able to send scores electronically to our institution.\u00a0\nFor more information, please visit their website at\u00a0www.ielts.org\n\nIELTS Score Requirements for Admission Consideration:\n\nAn overall minimum score of 7 for admission, with a score of no less than 6 on any individual module.\n\nRemediation\nIf the head of a unit or appropriate delegate finds sufficient grounds to believe that any graduate student appointed as a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate does not have spoken English proficiency adequate for undergraduate instruction, they must require the student to undertake a remediation process, in consultation with the Program in Global Languages & Communication and approved by the student\u2019s academic unit, prior to additional appointment as a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate. Such a determination should be made on the grounds of inadequate proficiency alone (as indicated in student evaluations, faculty observations, or the like). This remediation process will be required regardless of how the student was initially certified for oral English proficiency (that is, regardless of earning an undergraduate degree at an institution where English was the sole language of instruction or by achieving a passing score on one of the tests noted above).\nProcess for consulting with the Program in Global Languages and Communication regarding a remediation process for a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate:\u00a0The graduate program requesting consultation regarding a remediation process for a Teaching Assistant or Teaching Associate who is believed to not have spoken English proficiency adequate for undergraduate instruction\u00a0should email\u00a0TOEP@uci.edu\u00a0with the following information: (1) the student\u2019s information (name, UCI ID number, email address), and (2) the contact information (email) of the delegate from the hiring department who is requesting the consultation and/or overseeing the remediation process for the student.\u00a0The staff in the Program in\u00a0Global Languages and Communication\u00a0will then contact the student to set up an appointment during which the student will meet with an Academic Coordinator in the GLC Program who will\u00a0review, discuss, and/or assess the student\u2019s oral English proficiency. After meeting with the student, the GLC Program will provide a recommendation for a remediation plan to the delegate from the hiring department and the student\u2019s home department/program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetters of Recommendation\n\nYou are required to have\u00a0three letters of recommendation\u00a0submitted on your behalf. The letters should be submitted by instructors in a discipline related to your proposed field of study who are in a position to analyze your abilities and academic promise.\u00a0\u00a0Access to Letters of RecommendationThe\u00a0Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\u00a0of 1974 gives students (persons admitted and enrolled), the right to inspect letters of recommendation written in support of applications for admission. The law also permits students to waive that right if they choose, although such a waiver must be voluntary and cannot be a condition of admission, award, or employment.Waiving your right of access to the letters of recommendation is optional. However, the Admissions Committee cannot use letters of recommendation intended by the recommender to be confidential unless the applicant waives access by signing the Waiver of Access statement. The process for \u201cwaiving access\u201d or \u201cdeclining to waive access\u201d is described below.Online SubmissionFor the ApplicantComplete the Letter of Recommendation section on the online application. This will allow you to enter in your recommenders\u2019 names and e-mail addresses. An automated e-mail invitation will be sent to each of your recommenders. It is strongly recommended that you waive or decline to waive your rights of access to your letters of recommendation. After you have completed and submitted your application, you may continue to manage and monitor the status of their submission by logging into your online application and viewing the status page.\u00a0Please note that you can submit the application prior to all your letters of recommendations are received, but check with your\u00a0program\u00a0to verify the deadline of when all the letters need to be received.The application\u00a0will accept\u00a0Interfolio.\u00a0\u00a0If you need any support or have questions regarding Interfolio, please contact them directly at\u00a0https://www.interfolio.com/contact/.\u00a0We do not accept paper recommendation letters. Your recommenders must submit the letters via the recommendation form that is sent to them via email.For the RecommenderYour student will provide your contact information on their application which will generate an automated e-mail inviting you to log in and complete a recommendation form. Please follow the steps on the form and submit your recommendation for their application. The form will support document uploads or\u00a0you may copy and paste the text of your letter.\u00a0 We do not accept paper recommendation letters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscripts\n\nFor application review purposes only, scan and upload copies of transcripts for all institutions attended since high school. In the online application, you will be prompted to upload your scanned documents. Please upload both the front and back sides of the transcript. Uploaded transcripts should be recent and include the following: your name, dates of attendance, grades/marks received, credits and grading legend. UCI reserves the right to require official transcripts at any time during the admission process, and rescind any offer of admission made if discrepancies between uploaded and official transcript(s) are found. Official transcripts will be requested if and when you are admitted and decide to attend UCI. Do not send official transcripts until this time, unless you are requested to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupplemental Materials\n\nSome programs require submission of additional materials; please contact your program of interest to determine if any additional materials are required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication Deadlines\n\nApplication deadlines differ by program, so please determine the deadline for your program by visiting your program of interest in the Degree Programs section of the website. You must supply a valid e-mail address that you will maintain at least 8 months after you apply. If you are admitted, you will be notified via this e-mail address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer \n\n\n\nApplicants are expected to complete their UC application completely and accurately, and the truthfulness of that information is at the core of all admissions decisions. Falsified application information may include but is not limited to: making inaccurate statements on the application, withholding information requested on the application, giving false information, or submitting fraudulent or falsified documents in support of an admissions application.Proper submission of official materials is also of utmost importance. Letters of recommendation must be submitted by the letter writer; an applicant must not submit a letter of recommendation on behalf of the letter writer. In cases where an applicant has submitted incomplete or inaccurate information on their UCI application, or fraudulently submitted official application materials on behalf of another individual or institution, the matter will be reviewed as a case of falsification and will result in the cancellation of the application or the withdrawal of an admission offer.Please note that once submitted, your application materials will not, under any circumstances, be returned to you or forwarded to another entity on your behalf.\u00a0After You\u2019re AcceptedMake sure to check out our Admitted Students Checklists\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nUniversity of California Irvine\nGraduate Division\n120 Aldrich Hall\nIrvine, CA 92697-3180\n949-824-4611\ngrad@uci.edu\nDirections to/maps of UCI Campus\n\n\n\nQuestions?\nGraduate Admissions and Application Questions\nContact Graduate Admissions\nSchool or Program Inquiries\nGraduate Degree Programs\nGeneral Forms\nForms and Applications\nGeneral Inquiries\nEmail us at grad@uci.edu\nCall 949-824-4611\n\n\n\nConnect with Us\n\n\n\n\nFind us on\nFacebook\n\n\n\nFind us on\nTwitter\n\n\n\nFind us on\nInstagram\n\n\n\nFind us on\nLinkedin\n\n\n\nFind us on\nYouTube\n\n\n\nFind us on\nFlickr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us Privacy Policy Non-Discrimination Policy \u00a92022 UC Regents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
