We provide recent and historic metrics for both students and employees since the onset of COVID with comparative measures to the surrounding area.\nSummary as of Monday, April 24, 2023\n\nIsolation: As of today, there are 13 students isolating, most of whom are in Stanford student housing. At this time last week, the comparable number was 17.\nStudent testing: Positive test results for students during the week of Apr 17th-Apr 23rd totaled 8. This compares to 10 for the prior week of Apr 10th-Apr 16th.\nFaculty, staff and postdoc testing: Among this population, 44 total positive test results were reported for the week of Apr 17th-Apr 23rd. This compares to 40 for the prior week of Apr 10th-Apr 16th. (Note: faculty, staff and postdoc Color testing ended Mar 24.)\nVaccination: We have at least 95% of all Health Check users having attested to being fully vaccinated.\nPositivity rates in the displays below reflect Stanford\u2019s surveillance testing program provided by Color, not rapid antigen tests or any other testing. Color testing program ended March 24 for employees and will end June 18 for students.\n\n\nStudents\nThe data below is from student-reported positive tests, Color or Stanford PCR testing. Details of this program are available\u00a0here. In addition, across all time periods, the data below reflect the results of student tests for COVID undertaken or facilitated by Vaden Health Center, as well as the results of student-athlete surveillance testing for COVID. \nSkip to metric definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford student metric definitions\n\nVaccinated metrics\u00a0reflect the number of partially and fully COVID vaccinated individuals. This category will be updated monthly and sourced from Health Check user data based on the vaccination question only. Some users may be submitting while working remotely while others prior to coming onsite. Partially vaccinated are those having received only one dose of a two series. Typically, there is a 3-4 week waiting period to receive the second dose. Individuals are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving a single-dose vaccine or two weeks after the second dose in a two-dose series. This guidance applies to COVID-19 vaccines recommended by the CDC and currently authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson (J&J)/Janssen COVID-19 vaccines. This also applies to COVID vaccines that have been authorized for emergency use by the World Health Organization (e.g. AstraZeneca/Oxford, etc).\nTotal Health Check surveys reflects self-reports of daily surveillance status using the university\u2019s Health Check app since May, 2020. This includes reporting of symptoms, temperature monitoring, exposures, and recent travel history.\nTotal confirmed positive cases reflects a cumulative measure of the number of Stanford students living on, or near campus and enrolled or affiliated when they were diagnosed with COVID.  This dates back to March, 2020 and reflects test results from any testing provider, not just testing provided by the university as shown in the graphical display above.\nCurrent cases in isolation on campus reflects the number of students currently in isolation on the Stanford campus following a positive COVID test result.\n\nFaculty, staff and postdoctoral scholars\nThe display below shows the results of Stanford\u2019s on-campus COVID surveillance testing program for faculty, staff and postdoctoral scholars, administered by Color. The Color testing program for these populations lasted from Aug. 26, 2020 until Mar. 24, 2023. In addition, across all time periods, this display includes the results of testing of faculty, staff and postdoctoral scholars provided or facilitated by the Stanford University Occupational Health Center. The data do not include testing performed by other providers.\nSkip to metric definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford staff metric definitions\n\nVaccinated metrics\u00a0reflect the number of partially and fully COVID vaccinated individuals.

This includes reporting of symptoms, temperature monitoring, exposures, and recent travel history.\nTotal confirmed positive cases refers to positive cases among Stanford faculty, staff and postdoctoral scholars that were made known to Stanford through self-reporting into Health Check, hospital notification, or other reporting means, and verified by our clinicians, dating back to March, 2020. This reflects test results from any testing provider, not just testing provided by the university as shown in the graphic display above. These individuals may or may not have been working recently on campus; many university employees have been working remotely since March 2020. Please note that this count includes School of Medicine personnel including those working in patient-facing clinical settings.\n\nNotes on data displays above\nFor the displays of Stanford testing results shown above, please note:\n\nThe Color testing program for faculty, staff, and postdocs lasted from Aug. 26, 2020 until Mar. 24, 2023. The student Color testing program will continue until June 18, 2023.\nTest results are logged based on the date a testing sample is taken or collected.\nData on Stanford\u2019s surveillance testing program are updated weekly to ensure validation of results. However, if there is a significant outbreak of COVID at Stanford, the university community will be informed on an expedited basis.\nIndividuals may be tested multiple times. \u201cCumulative tests\u201d reflects the total number of tests performed, not the number of individuals tested.\nThe graphic displays of surveillance testing results only reflect results from the testing sources listed and do not include data from other testing providers.\nThe above data reporting displays results of the surveillance testing that has been provided on-site to students and employees by the university, along with separate cumulative numbers of COVID-positive cases the university has learned of. These cumulative numbers only include students living on or near the Stanford campus at the time of their positive test result.\n\nIn the event of a positive test\nThose who test positive through surveillance testing should self-isolate and refrain from leaving their isolation housing if living on campus or coming to campus if living off campus. Those living on campus in R&DE-assigned housing will receive isolation support and accommodations, including meal delivery at no cost to students.\u00a0\nIf you receive a positive test result, you will be asked to immediately complete Health Check to update your test status. Vaden Health Services (for students) or the university\u2019s Occupational Health Center will reach out to you about receiving a confirmatory test and will initiate exposure notification for close contacts as defined\u00a0here. In the meantime, you must remain self-isolated based on the positive results of the first test.\u00a0 Expect an additional call or follow-up by the local county public health department for contact tracing efforts.\u00a0\nIf you are experiencing severe symptoms, including difficulty breathing, contact your healthcare provider immediately.\u00a0\n\nAlternate data formats\nStanford University is committed to providing an online environment that is accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities.
