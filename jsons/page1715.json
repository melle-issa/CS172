In preparation, this post includes WordPress 6.3 proposed target dates and a call for its release squad.\nThe timeline for the second release of 2023 takes into consideration this year\u2019s two remaining flagship events \u2013 WordCampWordCamp WordCamps are casual, locally-organized conferences covering everything related to WordPress. They're one of the places where the WordPress community comes together to teach one another what they\u2019ve learned throughout the year and share the joy. Learn more. Europe in early June and WordCamp US and the Community Summit in late August. To avoid having major milestones (Beta1, RC1) conflictconflict A conflict occurs when a patch changes code that was modified after the patch was created. These patches are considered stale, and will require a refresh of the changes before it can be applied, or the conflicts will need to be resolved. with these events, this proposal suggests fitting the release process, from Beta1 to the final release, in the ten-week window between both events.\nAccording to the schedule proposed below and the GutenbergGutenberg The Gutenberg project is the new Editor Interface for WordPress. The editor improves the process and experience of creating new content, making writing rich content much simpler. It uses \u2018blocks\u2019 to add richness rather than shortcodes, custom HTML etc. https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/ release cadence, WordPress 6.3 would include up to Gutenberg 16.1 for a total of 10 Gutenberg releases.\nProposed WordPress 6.3 Schedule\nMilestoneDateAlpha (trunktrunk A directory in Subversion containing the latest development code in preparation for the next major release cycle. If you are running \"trunk\", then you are on the latest revision. open for 6.3 release)March 9, 2023BetaBeta A pre-release of software that is given out to a large group of users to trial under real conditions. Beta versions have gone through alpha testing in-house and are generally fairly close in look, feel and function to the final product; however, design changes often occur as part of the process. 1June 27, 2023Beta 2July 3, 2023*Beta 3July 11, 2023Release Candidaterelease candidate One of the final stages in the version release cycle, this version signals the potential to be a final release to the public.

Although the release schedule can\u2019t adapt to all holidays worldwide, planning a beta release on that day would likely have a low turn of participants on July 4th, given the significant contributor presence in the US.\nPlease leave your feedback about the schedule in the comments by April 30th.\nRelease Leads call for volunteers\nRelease Coordinator: TBD\nCoreCore Core is the set of software required to run WordPress.

Although feedback collection for the WordPress 6.2 release process is still open, positive sentiment around the experiment in the #6-2-release-leads Slack channel suggests repeating the role in 6.3.\nAll release decisions will ultimately be this release team\u2019s to make and communicate while gathering input from the community.\nJoin The Squad\u2026 or learn from them!\nIf you are interested in participating in 6.3\u2019s release squad, please show interest in the comments below. Most roles are better shared among more than one person to distribute the responsibilities.\nFolks interested in joining the upcoming all-women and non-binary release squad in 6.4 will work with a mentor. While this mentorship is not tied to the 6.3 release squad, nor do mentors need to volunteer in this release, shadowing the 6.3 release process is also recommended preparation for those being part of the following release.\nThanks to @cbringmann, @francina, for the peer review and feedback\n#6-3 #planningShare this:TwitterFacebookLogin to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJb Audras\n\n10:10 pm on April 14, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nThanks for the planning proposal, it looks great to me \ud83e\udd19\nI am interested in mentoring a person who could work on CoreCore Core is the set of software required to run WordPress.
