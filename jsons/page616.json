The university's\u00a0269 acres,\u00a0tucked against the rolling Sonoma hills, is full of\u00a0spacious green spaces, lakes, trees and\u00a0flowers, which\u00a0attract a bounty of butterflies to our\u00a0Butterfly Garden.\nThere also is a beauty that you can feel at SSU. Walking around campus, you can't help\u00a0but get caught up in our\u00a0inquisitive\u00a0spirit\u00a0and the incredible sense of community that radiates from our students, faculty and staff. Our programs\u00a0are ranked No. 19 among top public schools by \"U.S. News and World Report\"\u00a0and No.\u00a012 for transfer students by \"Money\" magazine. These are just some of the things that\u00a0make\u00a0Sonoma State one of the California State University\u2019s most popular campuses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Campus Attractions  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreen Music Center\n\n\n\n\nGreen Music Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDig Into Nature\n\n\n\n\nDig Into Nature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeawolves Athletics\n\n\n\n\nSeawolves Athletics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheatre Arts & Dance\n\n\n\n\nTheatre Arts & Dance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSonoma Film Institute\n\n\n\n\nSonoma Film Institute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Art Gallery\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Art Gallery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind more things to do at SSU\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlan Your Visit\n\n\n\n\nSonoma State University is located in Rohnert Park, a community of about 40,000 residents that is in the heart California's premier wine country.
