This is where you can download the source code for WordPress core, plugins and themes as well as the central location for community conversations and organization.  https://wordpress.org/, admin help, inline docs, and other general wordsmithing across the WordPress project.\n\n\nWant to get involved?\nThere are many ways in which you can help the Docs team. Every small contribution counts and helps! You can report an issue or typo you found in the docs, or even help us write new documentation for parts that are still missing. These are some helpful links to find out more about what we do and how to collaborate:\nDocs Team Handbook: An overview of what we do and how to collaborate\nWordPress Documentation Style Guide: Style guide for WordPress documentation\nBlock Editor Handbook: An overview of documentation contributions of BlockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. Editor / GutenbergGutenberg The Gutenberg project is the new Editor Interface for WordPress. The editor improves the process and experience of creating new content, making writing rich content much simpler. It uses \u2018blocks\u2019 to add richness rather than shortcodes, custom HTML etc. https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\nDevHub (developer.wordpress.org): The home of the developers\u2019 documentation\nHelpHub (wordpress.org/documentation): The home for all end-user documentation\nDocumentation Issue Tracker on GitHub: Submit any DevHub/HelpHub/\u201dDoc Team Handbook\u201d Docs-related issue on GitHubGitHub GitHub is a website that offers online implementation of git repositories that can easily be shared, copied and modified by other developers. Public repositories are free to host, private repositories require a paid subscription. GitHub introduced the concept of the \u2018pull request\u2019 where code changes done in branches by contributors can be reviewed and discussed before being merged be the repository owner.  https://github.com/.\n\n\nWeekly Meetings\nJoin our discussions of documentation issues here on the blog and on Slack.\nThe documentation team holds weekly office hours and monthly Contributor Days on each Tuesday of the month in the\u00a0#docs\u00a0SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform https://slack.com/.

Since it wasn\u2019t available at the time when the new sitemap was created, looking for a place for it is not easy.\nAt the moment, the Mobile App is split into 6 categories, mostly written in the FAQ format.\nGetting started\nTroubleshooting Login/signup issues\nDomains\nImages, video and audioMy sites\nMy account\nMy sites\nPosts and pages\nNext steps\nDocs team has opened a project in GitHub to begin content review.\nWhat needs to be reviewed:\nAll links \u2013 broken, outdated and find replacements\nContent \u2013 still relevant, has anything changed in the last version?\nImages \u2013 need new screenshots?\nFeatures \u2013 are there new features that are not documented yet?\nNew issues \u2013 are we missing documentation for any other issue?\nClassification\nThe team is also reviewing the classification to find a better pattern for users. Since the articles are written in an FAQ form, perhaps some articles can be rewritten in the new template as \u201cfeature description + how it works.\u201d\nHelp wanted\nAnyone wanting to help with content review, reach out to @estelaris in the #docs\u00a0SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform https://slack.com/.
