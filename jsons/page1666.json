The GTE (General Translation Editor) and LM (Locale Manager) roles can add new users with the \"Project Translation Editor\" role that can approve translations for specific projects. There are two different Translation Editor roles: \nGeneral Translation Editor and Project Translation Editor were a common piece of feedback I received in the Polyglots outreach effort. Most, if not all, teams wanted to set clearer expectations for new translators; other teams struggled with translation editors who were no longer available to help grow the team.\nThis reminded me of my previous exercise with the Make/Training team to define a contributor ladder. While the Polyglots teamPolyglots Team Polyglots Team is a group of multilingual translators who work on translating plugins, themes, documentation, and front-facing marketing copy. https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/. has clear roles\u2014particularly because most roles are tied to permissions\u2014I\u2019m unsure of when expectations related to these roles were last discussed.\nAs a result of this feedback, I\u2019d like to present my understanding of what a contributor\u2019s progression may look like on the Polyglots team. In presenting this resource, I hope it can define current expectations for Polyglots contributors and potentially identify any gaps that may exist.\nCurrent Polyglots Roles\nWhen I think of the Polyglots team, this is how I see the team roles. If I align these roles with the concept of the contributor ladder, it might look like:\nTranslator (Connecting)\nContributes suggested translations\nCommunicates with local translation editors for feedback\n\nProject Translation EditorProject Translation Editor A Project Translation\u00a0Editor (often referred to as PTE) is a person, who has access to validate strings on a specific\u00a0project\u00a0(for example BuddyPress, WooCommerce or Twenty Fourteen) for one\u00a0specific locale. A\u00a0project translation editor can approve strings that are added by translation contributors. Per project translation, editors are appointed by a general translation editor\u00a0after a request by the project\u00a0author or by the contributors themselves.

It\u2019s a lot, especially with a small team!\nCurrently, the Polyglots Global Mentors have two sub-roles: a Global Mentor and a Tech Lead. Similarly, I\u2019d like to propose distinct sub-roles for General Translation Editors:\u00a0\nTranslation Quality \u2192 Review translations and proactively provide feedback to translators.\nCommunity \u2192 Recruit and mentor translators.\nDocumentation \u2192 Maintain team documentation, such as the Glossary or local Handbooks.\nMarketing \u2192 Coordinate local marketing efforts, such as translating /news posts.\nExploring ways to highlight expectations for Project Translation Editors in each locale may also be interesting. When approving a PTEProject Translation Editor A Project Translation\u00a0Editor (often referred to as PTE) is a person, who has access to validate strings on a specific\u00a0project\u00a0(for example BuddyPress, WooCommerce or Twenty Fourteen) for one\u00a0specific locale. A\u00a0project translation editor can approve strings that are added by translation contributors. Per project translation, editors are appointed by a general translation editor\u00a0after a request by the project\u00a0author or by the contributors themselves., would it be helpful to share if they\u2019re also expected to review and provide feedback on suggested translations for your locale? What might those expectations look like?\u00a0\nThe benefits of outlining these specialties are that they highlight the many different roles translation editors play. Clearly outlining these tasks may make it easier for teams to decide if and how to divide these responsibilities.\u00a0\nFeedback and improvements\nWhile I recognize that more documentation won\u2019t immediately help resolve the challenges that inspired this post, I believe it\u2019s useful to agree on a definition and expectations for these roles. For the locale teams that are specifically struggling to add new GTEs when others are inactive, it\u2019s particularly important to ensure everyone is clear on the expectations of their role. Things change, and stepping back from a position or inviting others to help is okay.\nWith that in mind, I would appreciate any feedback you have. In particular, I would like to know:\nAm I missing any roles in these diagrams?\nDoes this match your experience with contributing to Polyglots?\nDoes this match your team\u2019s structure?\nWould you add any roles? Has your locale team added any roles?\nWhat do you think of creating \u201csub-roles\u201d for translation editors?\u00a0\nHow could this resource be useful to you?\nI would love to use this to enhance existing documentation in the Polyglots Handbook, especially the Roles and Capabilities page. Your feedback on this post is welcome, either in the comments or in SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform https://slack.com/. The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at https://make.wordpress.org/chat/. for any additional discussion.

In our localeLocale Locale = language version, often a combination of a language code and a region code, for instance es_MX denotes Spanish as it\u2019s used in Mexico. A list of all locales supported by WordPress in https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/ nl_NL we have a roll called GPTE. This roll can approve/reject all projects within Themes and Plugins and in our case also for MetaMeta Meta is a term that refers to the inside workings of a group. For us, this is the team that works on internal WordPress sites like WordCamp Central and Make WordPress..\nDoes this match your experience with contributing to Polyglots?\n  Yes it does, although the activities of GTE\u2019s are low and not very active.\nDoes this match your team\u2019s structure?\n   No as indicated we have a roll GPTE added.\nWould you add any roles? Has your locale team added any roles?\n   Yes we have (GPTE), I think it would be great to generally add the GPTE roll. So the GTE\u2019s will have less work checking translations. And also this roll could help training new translators\nWhat do you think of creating \u201csub-roles\u201d for translation editorsTranslation Editor Translation editors can approve translations for projects. The GTE (General Translation Editor) and LM (Locale Manager) roles can add new users with the \"Project Translation Editor\" role that can approve translations for specific projects. There are two different Translation Editor roles:\nGeneral Translation Editor and Project Translation Editor?\n   Depends on which activities you are thinking about.\nHow could this resource be useful to you?\n   For me as a GPTE not that much as I am already involved with education.\nCommon thoughts:\nTelling the PTE to check his project is something I did, but the GTE team was not that happy with it. I think if you give a PTE role to someone, he/she should take care of the project. Problem with this is the fact that you do not get notified when new texts arrive of translation suggestions or fuzzes are present. To be able to do this, it would require new functionality \u201cSend an email if something happens in the project you are PTE for\u201d. Add an opt-in option so people can refuse the messages.\nThe problem with most of these PTE\u2019s is the fact, that they translate the project because they use it, and do not want to get involved with other projects or even their own. Also in my experience, people start translating and after it is ready stop using the project because they lost interest or the project becomes to bad, and other better projects will be used.\nAlso depending on the locale, I think mentoring the group of GTE\u2019s actively would help improving the process. There are sometimes discussions that do not lead to a solution, or simply are not answered. I do not know if it exists, but a template of what the roll of GTE, GPTE, PTE exactly is, would be helpfull. There is some documentation, but obviously looking at the amount of comments after requesting PTE, people did not read it.\nAlso what needs to be changed is the standard answer if someone asks for the PTE roll. I personally find some messages a bit annoying, as it does not motivate people to proceed with translating. If someone has added a lot of translations, I think the message should only be \u201cWe will check your suggestions and come back to you with granting the roll, or we will advice you how to improve the suggestions by providing the necessary links to be able to do that. \nMost people start translating like I did, without knowing that there exists documentation how to translate. A possible solution would be to provide default links after clicking the link \u201cYou can help improving the translation of this project. E.g. show a popup and give the links depending on the locale or the general links to the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErica Varlese\n\n4:24 pm on April 27, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nThank you for such a thoughtful reply, @psmits1567!

The CL-PTE is NOT able to approve, reject, or edit strings from other users, but can upload a translation if there is no approved translation present since before. The \u201cquality assurance\u201d here lies one step earlier. A CL-PTE is only supposed to upload translations that have been sourced from professional translators. (And if we see that this role gets abused, then it can, obviously, be removed from the user.)\nThe CL-PTE should not be anybody\u2019s personal account.

From what you\u2019ve shared, it sounds like that approach has been very helpful for mentoring (or motivating!) active contributors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLidia Pellizzaro\n\n10:07 am on April 29, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nI think the \u201cSuper PTEProject Translation Editor A Project Translation\u00a0Editor (often referred to as PTE) is a person, who has access to validate strings on a specific\u00a0project\u00a0(for example BuddyPress, WooCommerce or Twenty Fourteen) for one\u00a0specific locale.

But I don\u2019t know if we need to formally specify a bunch of sub-roles. Especially for smaller teams, we might create more confusion that way.\nBut it\u2019s very good to somehow describe various things that need to be done. In the Swedish team, for instance, we\u2019ve got 4 GTEGeneral Translation Editor A General Translation Editor (often referred to as GTE) is a person, who has global access to validate strings on all projects for a specific locale.\u2019s.

But it\u2019s still good. They\u2019re welcome to come back any minute, and yes, they have contributed a lot in the past.\nSo my view is that each team would need to somehow decide how they internally will make sure that all important corners are covered. But I don\u2019t see a need for more specific roles with gradual access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLidia Pellizzaro\n\n4:23 pm on April 27, 2023 \n\n\n\n\n+1\nTo be clear, I also think an internal or public document to organize the activities is sufficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErica Varlese\n\n4:33 pm on April 27, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nThank you! The descriptions in your earlier comment were really helpful, and I think should be the basis for any updates to our documentation. (I know some of that exists in the Handbook already, but from the comments, it sounds like extra clarity is a good thing!)\nI\u2019d love your perspective both from your local team and as a global mentor:\n\n\nDo you have any concerns about including Super PTEs in the ladder, or might that also create more confusion for smaller teams?\n\nWhat do you think of encouraging localeLocale Locale = language version, often a combination of a language code and a region code, for instance es_MX denotes Spanish as it\u2019s used in Mexico.

That way, these sub-roles can exist for larger teams, but smaller teams can do away with them altogether if it doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntobifjellner (Tor-Bjorn Fjellner)\n\n9:18 pm on April 27, 2023 \n\n\n\n\n@evarlese\nIt makes sense to mention the convenience and the possibility for some midway stop in the \u201cladder\u201d of a localeLocale Locale = language version, often a combination of a language code and a region code, for instance es_MX denotes Spanish as it\u2019s used in Mexico.
