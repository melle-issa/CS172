If a qualified pool of internal candidates is not identified, qualified external candidates may be considered at the discretion of the hiring department.CNAS is navigating a new travel system with the launch of Concur earlier this year. As of July 2023, the campus will launch Oracle Cloud Financials & Kuali Research Administration systems. Taken collectively, these new tools will transform the way we do business and are known as the Impact23 Project. This position is the key component in the Dean's Office strategy to evaluate operations and create standards in this new environment. The incumbent's areas of support include Impact23 C&G/Budget/Procurement, projects related to on-going commitments such as faculty IC/Start Up, TAs, GSRs, Primary Temp Teach, Course Material Fees, and Payroll. As an Impact 23 C&G/Procurement specialist, the position oversees process engineering, manages budget reconciliation & C&G processes, and provides guidance & consultation to CNAS departments. In addition, the position will play a critical role in helping us remedy our largest operational pain points, work toward streamlined solutions and utilize substantive knowledge of best practices, controls and reporting to bring creative, simple solutions to the forefront. Finally, while 60% of the position is focused on Impact23 for the next 24 months, 40% of the responsibilities include a share of Dean's Office Financial Team duties to include ad-hoc reporting, ledger reconciliation, budget call, and fiscal close processes. The weight of responsibilities included in this position will evolve as our operations within the Impact23 framework mature. The responsibility as a process expert, engineer and guide are a durable component of this role. As operations stabilize, we expect that the incumbent will take a greater share of senior level financial analysis and reporting within the Dean's Office Financial Team.As a condition of employment, you will be required to comply with the University of California SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Vaccination Program Policy.
