Allred is the author of three poetry collections, Whetstone, winner of the Flume Press Chapbook award, Particulate (Bear Star Press), and The Evolutionary Purpose of Heartbreak (Turning Point Books). Allred spent many years teaching in the English department at CSU, Chico, and currently lives just outside of Chico with her husband, dogs, and a few chickens.\nAllred\u2019s work delves deeply into the human condition and explores the interconnectivity between the self and nature. Her words are a quiet meditation on living, loving, and losing. She often takes something ordinary and reveals its extraordinary essence by using metaphoric language to zero in on a specific experience or emotion. The speaker of her poems is often an observational one that acts as a guide into this meditation and connection to nature. Her poem \u201cPlum in Early Spring,\u201d from Whetstone, for instance, does this:\nFor three rainy weeks my plum tree\nkeeps a thousand small fists.\nThen one warm day it explodes.\nThe sweet tethered cloud blazes\nangel white, innocent of consequence,\nnot caring for how long the rain\nhas gone or if frost lurks\na few days away. The blooms don\u2019t inquire\nhave the hives dried, will bees be out\nin time to nuzzle their open hearts.\n\u00a0\nUnconcerned with plans for harvest\nthey ignore my pleas to be patient, to reflect\nbefore taking an irrevocable step.\nTrees simply answer the season\u2019s necessity,\nunable to deny the spirit\nmoving through by drawing silly\ndistinctions between the self and soul.\nThis poem begins with the simple image of a plum tree, but as the poem progresses a parallel between what is happening to this tree and what sometimes happens with humans emerges\u2013a sudden burst of inspiration and an urge to follow one\u2019s desires, to be wild in spirit without stopping too long to think about it, to \u201csimply answer to the season\u2019s necessity.\u201d This poem also unveils the yearning and sometimes impatience humans have to control the natural world, which cannot be contained. Even though this poem starts off simply, it makes leaps to ultimately arrive at something much larger.\nPlease join us for a lovely evening with Joanne Harris Allred, Thursday, April 10th at 7:30 pm in Colousa 100B. Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, Writer\u2019s Voice readings are free and open to the public.\nBy Kris Wheat\n\n \n\nApril 9, 2014watershedcsuc CSUC, Joanne Harris Allred, poetry, Writer's Voice Reading Series\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nBook in Common Reading: Brian\u00a0Turner \n\n\nThe Book in Common Committee presents a reading of poetry and memoir by Brian Turner, Tuesday, April 1, 7:30 p.m., PAC 134.\nBrian Turner is the author of My Life as a Foreign Country: A Memoir (W.W.
