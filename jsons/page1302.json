The Occupational Health Center and Vaden Health Services are able to order COVID PCR testing in specific circumstances and situations. Also,\u00a0wastewater analysis\u00a0continues to provide extensive data on the prevalence of the virus on campus and in our region.\nFaculty, staff, and postdocs should continue reporting positive test results on\u00a0Health Check, and students should do so on the\u00a0Vaden patient portal.\u00a0They should also use those portals for specific COVID-related exposure or health concerns.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your ongoing efforts to follow\u00a0campus health protocols, including our strong recommendation for masking while in crowded settings.\u00a0\u00a0In good health,\nJames Jacobs, MDExecutive DirectorVaden Health ServicesChair of the Stanford University Public Health Steering Committee\u00a0Rich Wittman, MD, MPHMedical DirectorStanford University Occupational Health Center\n\n\nPrevious postClassroom masking recommendations\nNext postChange in COVID vaccination policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford\n\n \nCOVID-19\nHealth Alerts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Health Resources\n\nSchool of Medicine COVID-19 Updates\nStudent Affairs Guidance for Students\nVaden Health Center (for students)\nSU Occupational Health Center (for employees)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther COVID-19 resources\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nU.S. Food & Drug Administration\nSanta Clara County Public Health\nSan Mateo County Health\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\nFor questions related to Stanford's response to COVID-19 or other health concerns, please fill out this EH&S Health Guidance form.\nFor feedback about this website, please email digital-strategy@stanford.edu.\n\n\n\nConnect with us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanfordUniversity\n\n\n\n\nStanford Home(link is external)\n\nMaps & Directions(link is external)\n\nSearch Stanford(link is external)\n\nEmergency Info(link is external)\n\n\n\nTerms of Use(link is external)\n\nPrivacy(link is external)\n\nCopyright(link is external)\n\nTrademarks(link is external)\n\nNon-Discrimination(link is external)\n\nAccessibility(link is external)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University.\n\u00a0 Stanford, California 94305.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
