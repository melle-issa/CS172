He quickly explains how he\u2019s part of a new program on campus and hands out his card.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to reimagine how we approach safety,\u201d he told a group of students.\n\n \n\n\nCampus Safety Responder Oscar Jacques, talks with students Nicholas Leigh and Jayan Patel on Thursday, March 9, 2023, at UC Riverside. (UCR/Stan Lim)\n\nJacques is one of four campus safety responders who joined the UCR police department last November as part of a new team of non-sworn, unarmed safety professionals. The new addition reflects a tiered approach to safety the department is taking in which it no longer sends armed officers to every call.\u00a0\n\u201cWe can focus the law enforcement officers on the emergency calls and the campus safety responders on community safety and being a liaison to the campus,\u201d said Sgt. James Wright, who oversees the team.\nIt\u2019s part of a new approach that focuses on improving safety through prevention, intervention, and education, instead of just enforcement. \u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s sending a different message,\u201d said Jeffrey Talbott, police chief and campus safety director. \u201cThis model we\u2019re rolling out is more in line with the idea that we\u2019re here for you, we\u2019re here for the community.\u201d\nTwo years ago, the police department became part of the newly created Health, Well-being, and Safety division, which brings together police, counseling, health, and other services under one umbrella so the campus can coordinate those services in a more comprehensive way.\nIn addition to wearing uniforms different from police officers, campus safety responders\u2019 patrol vehicles have a different insignia and colors from the department\u2019s black and white police vehicles. Their vehicles are white with blue and gold stripes and \u201cCampus Safety\u201d inscribed on the side.\nThe four campus safety responders each work 12-hour shifts, split into night and day shifts, so that one is on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\nThey deal with a variety of tasks that include responding to medical aid emergency calls, taking crime reports, traffic control, and patrolling the campus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting being part of something on the ground level,\u201d Jacques said. \u201cI think this is one of those cornerstone times when law enforcement is changing.\u201d\n\n \n\n\nCampus Safety Responder Oscar Jacques walks to his patrol vehicle after visiting with students around the HUB on Thursday, March 9, 2023, at UC Riverside. (UCR/Stan Lim)\n\nJacques previously worked for 23 years as a parking enforcement officer in Transportation Services and knows the campus well. He was attracted to the new position due to the community engagement opportunity.\n\u201cI love talking to people,\u201d he said. \u201cI love interacting with people, especially being part of a diverse campus with people from different backgrounds.\u201d\nHe joked that he\u2019s naturally talkative. In his encounters with students, they\u2019re soon smiling and laughing as he cracked jokes.\n\u201cI try to make myself as approachable as possible,\u201d he said.\nYusra Oda, a third-year microbiology student, told Jacques she was a little apprehensive at first when he walked up to her and her sister Alaa Oda, a first-year microbiology student at the HUB Plaza.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s so cool,\u201d she said after learning about the campus safety responder program. \u201cI feel like the fact there are more of them on campus talking to students will make them more approachable and students more comfortable.\u201d\n\n \n\n\nCampus Safety Responder Oscar Jacques, shares a laugh and talks to third-year microbiology student Yusra Oda, middle, and her sister,  first-year microbiology student Alaa Oda  on Thursday, March 9, 2023, at UC Riverside. (UCR/Stan Lim)\n\nJacques said he\u2019s noticed that some students feel less intimidated dealing with campus safety responders. He described a recent medical aid he responded to involving a student who had been drinking. She was concerned she might be in trouble but relaxed once she saw he was only there to provide help, Jacques said.\nLike Jacques, the other three responders all have backgrounds in public safety. One is an alum who was a member of the department\u2019s community service officer program, another came from UCLA police, and the third worked in corporate safety and has a military background.\nJacques said they all share a commitment to helping the campus community.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here because of our students,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to see them get through their school years and graduate and see them succeed.\u201d\n\n \n\n\nCampus Safety Responder Oscar Jacques is silhouetted as he walks the North District student housing compex on Thursday, March 9, 2023, at UC Riverside.
