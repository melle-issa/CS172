With water dancing on windows and wind howling in the distance, she and her younger brother would create a makeshift baseball diamond in her childhood living room.Even when the game was little more than pillow bases and a handful of wiffle balls, Whitmore knew one thing for certain.Rain or shine, she was always going to play baseball.First Season as a FerryhawkWhitmore \u00e2\u0080\u009920, \u00e2\u0080\u009922 (B.S. kinesiology, M.S. instructional design and technology), a Cal State Fullerton alumna and professional baseball player, took the field in April 2022 as an outfielder and pitcher for the Staten Island FerryHawks.

Their support helped me open up about my hopes for the future.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSoftball head coach Kelly Ford met Whitmore at a recruiting camp in 2017 and was impressed by her drive, athleticism and shining potential.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember her spending time with our baseball staff,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Ford. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter that, there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a year that went by that she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t participate in a camp, a USA Baseball event or training.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFrom late nights in the bullpen to networking events, Whitmore seized every opportunity for professional development at CSUF and grew as a leader and teammate.\u00e2\u0080\u009cKelsie welcomed all the freshmen with open arms and guided us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Alyssa Hernandez, former Titan softball player and Whitmore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best friend. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe always put others before herself and set a good example of what it means to be a Titan softball player.\u00e2\u0080\u009dFord adds that Whitmore left behind a legacy of strength, kindness and wisdom when she graduated \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a legacy that still exists today.\u00e2\u0080\u009cKelsie changed the standard of how the Titans take the field,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Ford. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHer teammates and coaches had the utmost respect for her, and she will forever be a part of Titan softball.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBaseball Hits HomeWhitmore started playing catch with her dad when she was 6 years old. As an energetic kid who loved being outdoors, her childhood revolved around sports. She played soccer, volleyball, golf, and participated in high school track and field, but her heart always went back to baseball.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never saw myself doing anything else,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Whitmore.Kelsie Whitmore began playing baseball when she was 6 years old.Before joining the USA Baseball team in 2014, she played Little League and was on Temecula Valley High School\u00e2\u0080\u0099s varsity team. She also played travel baseball, where her dad doubled as her coach for several seasons. With each step, Whitmore knew that she wanted to be a professional baseball player, but she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always say it out loud.\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople would ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I knew. I knew exactly what I wanted to do, but I stopped telling people because I got shut down a lot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Whitmore.It took some time, but in the face of criticism, she learned to be unapologetic about her goals by surrounding herself with positivity and a healthy support system.Her dream is to sign an MLB contract with the San Diego Padres \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the team that she grew up watching.Changing the GameToday, when Whitmore takes the field, she does so with a quiet confidence that eclipses the challenges she has faced along the way.\u00e2\u0080\u009cI compared myself to men because they were my competition. I never had a body like them. I never had the build, the strength, the speed or the power, and I was so envious of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d shares Whitmore. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI overworked myself trying to outperform the competition. What helped me overcome that was learning to love what I was given and who I was.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOutfielder Evelyn Sablan (right) and alumna Kelsie Whitmore (left) became friends while playing on the Titan softball team.Peyton Toto, a third-year Titan infielder, says that Whitmore\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vulnerability is reshaping the game for young athletes.\u00e2\u0080\u009cHer story has inspired a lot of girls to chase their goals. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rare that a person would keep going after being told so many times, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Women don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play baseball\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sport,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Toto.Despite these challenges, Whitmore says she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proud to be opening doors for future female MLB baseball players.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing for young people, we are going to reap the benefits as a sports community for decades to come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Ford. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs far as breaking the glass ceiling, her journey has only just begun.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Support Titan Softball:give.fullerton.edu/softballMore StoriesOnce a Titan, Always a TitanThe Secret\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the Hot SauceChloe the Engineer Stomps Out StereotypesRaising $270 Million: A Titan Success StoryPresident\u00e2\u0080\u0099s MessageThis site is maintained by Division of University AdvancementTo report problems or to comment about this site, please contact strategiccomm@fullerton.edu\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0|\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Privacy Policy\u00c2\u00a9 California State University, Fullerton.
