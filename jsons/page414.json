More than ever, day-to-day interactions with government are powered by digital systems, and yet far too many Federal IT projects arrive late or over budget. Others are simply abandoned. These failures are often felt by those who count on it most \u2014 working class Americans and people who turn to government in a moment of need.\nThe U.S. Digital Service on whitehouse.gov\nWhen you\u2019re presented with an opportunity to help transform how the federal government works for the American people, it\u2019s really hard to say no.\nFor five years and counting, I\u2019ve had the honor and privilege as a lead developer of WordPress to play a role in a large, incredible movement to democratize publishing. From my home in D.C., I\u2019ve closely watched open data and open government efforts. I feel very strongly about an open, transparent, and efficient government \u2014 boosted in no small part by WordPress and open source.\nI\u2019ve long admired a number of my new teammates,\u00a0especially Erie Meyer, Gray Brooks, and Haley van Dyck, for years of\u00a0tenacity and hard work trying to change government from the inside out. I\u2019ve always felt I could be more effective helping government from the outside, by continuing to work on WordPress.\u00a0After all, we\u2019ve all heard horror stories of all sorts of red tape, from hiring to procurement and everything in between. And we\u2019ve all heard how difficult government itself makes it to launch good government digital services. While many of us may have have wanted to help, few thought they could. Fewer knew how.\nBut then the U.S. Digital Service was formed, from the team that helped rescue healthcare.gov. It\u2019s dedicated to tackling some of government\u2019s most pressing problems, ones that directly affect millions of people\u2019s lives.\u00a0The formula\u00a0is simple: take\u00a0what helped turn around healthcare.gov and apply it to other high priority projects across government.\nIn this day and age, public policy must be backed by effective technology to succeed. The American people need our help and our government has asked us to serve, as doers and makers, creative thinkers, and specialized technologists dedicated to untangling, rewiring, and redesigning our government.\nIn January, I joined the U.S. Digital Service.\nWhen I was approached, I have to admit that I was nervous to step back from the day-to-day buzz of WordPress because I\u2019ve invested so much. But the community stepped up, in most cases not even knowing about my life change. That\u2019s the beauty of open source, and the fantastic WordPress community in particular. WordPress continues to play an important role in my\u00a0life. With Matt Mullenweg\u2019s support and encouragement, I\u2019m taking time away from Audrey, where I\u2019ve worked since 2010. I\u2019m still actively involved in the project, just not full time.\nThe U.S. Digital Service is the real deal. I\u2019ve been astounded by the impact we\u2019ve already made. We\u2019ve recruited some of the best and brightest. Don\u2019t just take my word for it \u2014 do what you can to learn more about this movement and come help us make government better. If you haven\u2019t seen the video below yet, take a look. (A few of you have\u00a0noticed me in the background.)\nIt\u2019s my nature to look for the hardest problems to solve. I like to take on big challenges and spend every ounce of energy working to solve them. I believe in what we\u2019re doing here. The stakes are high.\u00a0No matter the challenge, I know what we\u2019re doing will change millions of lives.\nI thought I had made the most of my decade in D.C. I\u2019ve witnessed a lot of history. I knew I\u2019d have some great stories to tell my future kids and grandkids. I was there. I saw it. That was only the beginning.\n\n\n\nPosted on March 29, 2015July 1, 2016Tags government, U.S. Digital Service, WordPress8 Comments on I\u2019ve joined the White House\u2019s U.S. Digital Service \n\n\n\nYou can call it congestion or throttling. I call it unacceptable. \n\nI pay for 105 Mbps of downstream Internet from Comcast, and I get just 6 Mbps every evening.\nI\u2019ve been running speed tests\u00a0for weeks now. It looks like this every time:\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEvery day.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEvery night.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nI put a sizable hole in my wallet every month for \u201cBlast\u201d internet. Comcast even upgraded \u201cBlast\u201d from 50 Mbps to 105 Mbps recently, but each evening, I might as well be using their 6 Mbps \u201cPerformance Starter.\u201d When I actually want to use anything close to the speeds they charge me for, I can\u2019t.\nPlease, Comcast, tell me how you\u2019re going to blame Netflix for this one.\nPlease, Comcast, tell me again you can send a technician but only during business hours, when my Internet works fine.\nPlease, Comcast, tell me how you\u2019re going to charge me more.\nPlease, Comcast, tell me how net neutrality would stifle \u201cinnovation\u201d and discourage you from \u201cinvesting\u201d in infrastructure.\nAnd please, Comcast, tell me how that would be any different from the status quo.\n\n\nPosted on June 12, 2014June 12, 2014Tags net neutrality3 Comments on You can call it congestion or throttling. I call it unacceptable. \n\n\n\nSecurity is nuanced \n\nAs a software vendor, there are many reasons to prefer responsible disclosure of security issues. But the most important reason is also less obvious: vulnerability reports\u00a0need\u00a0to be correct.\nI\u2019ve seen countless \u201cfull disclosure\u201d reports that are wrong and invalid. Most of these could have been prevented by privately disclosing it to the vendor and allowing them the opportunity to respond.\nEveryone sees WordPress in the headlines, over and over again, but no one ever notices the \u201cthis report is invalid\u201d response. We\u2019ve prevented countless invalid reports from being published simply because they were disclosed to us first. This is better for the software\u2019s users, who are otherwise left to scramble every time they see a report. They are not an expert, and often, neither is the reporter.\nThere\u2019s another angle here, though: sometimes, the vulnerability report is correct, but\u00a0incomplete. This too can send everyone scrambling, starting with the vendor who was not\u00a0given the opportunity to straighten things out.\nWhen responsible disclosure works, it works really well. I offer Jetpack\u2019s recent vulnerability\u00a0as a recent case study. While this was discovered internally at Automattic, the effect is the same: they were able to quickly and thoroughly investigate the issues and follow through with a plan of action. During their investigation they learned the problem was far more severe than they originally identified, and that their initial proposed fix was incomplete.\nThere will always be individuals who want everything to be fully disclosed, and there are some great arguments for that. I\u2019m not trying to sway you one way or the other. But if you\u2019re trying to do the right thing \u2014 you\u2019re doing full disclosure in the interest of users, possibly even providing a patch or steps to mitigate \u2014 working with the vendor is a good way to ensure you haven\u2019t missed anything.\nI\u2019m not sure how many times now I\u2019ve responded to a mailing list saying, \u201cwell, this isn\u2019t a vulnerability,\u201d or \u201cyour proposed patch is incomplete,\u201d or \u201cyour patch makes it worse.\u201d Or when I don\u2019t respond to the mailing list because my thought is This is worse than the reporter realizes.\nSecurity is nuanced.\nLast week, a security researcher disclosed some issues\u00a0with WordPress. They stated that WordPress issues a cookie in plain HTTP that identifies the user. Correct. They also stated that this cookie does not expire when the user logs out. Also correct.\nShe went on to state that the cookie has a lifetime of 3 years, that it can be used to mess with the account\u2019s two-factor authentication settings, and change their email and other settings. She followed that up with \u201chave notified them and waited 24hrs for response, none yet. guessing it\u2019s a wontfix for now, since their SSL support is patchy.\u201d\nYes, absolutely, SSL support in WordPress is patchy. (Coincidentally, fixing all of this was already slated for the next major release.) While you can force SSL for the dashboard, we don\u2019t have the concept of forcing SSL for the front-end of the site. So, that \u201clogged in\u201d cookie is issued over plain HTTP.\u00a0It\u2019s trivial in a plugin to force that cookie to be secure, but of course most users aren\u2019t going to do that. Of course, most users also aren\u2019t using SSL (sadly).\nWordPress also doesn\u2019t have any concept of session management. The user is authenticated and a cookie is issued, but there\u2019s no way for it to be automatically invalidated upon logout (without you changing your password). Changing this is a major architectural change we\u2019ve been planning for some time. But this is also why cookies are designed with a\u00a0limited expiration: just 48 hours, or 14 days if you click \u201cRemember me.\u201d\nBut the report was that it didn\u2019t expire for three years, right? This is where it gets a bit weird. I\u2019d love it if \u201cRemember me\u201d remembered you for 30, 90, or even 365 days, but WordPress will wait to make any changes\u00a0until\u00a0cookies can be invalidated. Some time ago, though, WordPress.com configured this cookie to last for three years.\nNormally, this wouldn\u2019t be that bad. You see, the \u201clogged in\u201d cookie is\u00a0relatively harmless. It allows\u00a0presentational things like\u00a0the toolbar, edit links in your theme, and such. But you can\u2019t use it to manage your account, change your email, or do anything particularly crazy. In fact, WordPress issues\u00a0a separate, secure \u201cauth\u201d cookie used\u00a0for the \u201cwp-admin\u201d dashboard.\u00a0It\u2019s like Amazon knowing who you are after six months of not being on the site, but asking you to log in when you start to check out.\nOn WordPress.com, however, a lot of settings can be managed outside of the dashboard, on their \u201cnew dashboard,\u201d at wordpress.com/settings/. As you might have guessed by now, they were not requiring the \u201cauth\u201d cookie on this page, only the \u201clogged in\u201d cookie. That is the true critical vulnerability here. A number of decisions came together to make a\u00a0latent issue a very real one. The issue wasn\u2019t reported like this because the reporter isn\u2019t familiar with\u00a0the intricacies of user authentication internals in WordPress, nor should anyone expect them to. Rather, an\u00a0assumption was made it was a design decision that would probably just be a \u201cwontfix\u201d due to \u201cpatchy\u201d SSL support.\nThe disclosure was well-intentioned, but because it happened within just 24 hours, Automattic wasn\u2019t able to react quickly enough to identify the actual issue and request that it not be disclosed until they got a fix in place.\nI\u2019m just trying to set the record straight on what happened, since I keep seeing confused tweets, blog posts, comments, and Facebook\u00a0chatter. (Favorite Facebook comment, after I posted a brief explanation:\u00a0\u201cDid we just open all those nesting doll layers to discover the belly was empty?\u201d) This situation probably could have been handled better by everyone involved, but that\u2019s not really the point. The primary issue is now handled, and other issues are also being addressed. I don\u2019t think this requires post-mortem blog posts with a side of FUD. I\u2019m not looking for a debate on full disclosure versus responsible disclosure. And I certainly don\u2019t think anyone should be questioning\u00a0the researcher, who has spent years dedicating herself to making the Internet more secure.\nIn this case, WordPress.com the service was able to react quickly to mitigate this issue for all of its users. Of course, with software, holes can\u2019t be closed so easily, and in this case, the situation was probably exacerbated by confusing WordPress.com the service with WordPress the software. That confusion is easy to understand, especially since some of these issues have roots in the core software.\nSecurity is nuanced.\nI\u2019ve not linked to any previous posts because I don\u2019t want this to be a criticism of any researcher or writer, but if you\u2019re looking for\u00a0background: 1\u00a02\u00a03. Also, related work for WordPress 4.0 is happening here.\n\n\nPosted on May 30, 2014May 30, 2014Tags security, WordPress5 Comments on Security is nuanced \n\n\n\nMy Talk Proposals for Open Source Bridge \n\nUpdate, April 29:\u00a0I\u2019m excited to share that both of these proposals were accepted. See you soon, Portland!\n\n\u00a0\nI submitted two proposals to Open Source Bridge, an annual conference in Portland, Oregon, for \u201copen source citizens.\u201d The call for papers is now closed, but they let anyone leave comments on proposals that are private to the conference organizers. If you have any feedback on these, or have seen me speak before, it would be awesome if you could leave a comment. Here they are:\nExtreme Software Portability as an Art Form\nWriting portable software is hard. Throw in thousands of bad and worse shared hosting configurations, a decade of technical debt, the need to cater to a sprawling ecosystem, and PHP \u2014 and you have WordPress. We\u2019ve found breaking changes harm our community and unfairly punish our users, so we don\u2019t make them. But that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t innovate or evolve \u2014 we\u2019re just forced to get really clever. And it works, with adoption continuing to soar.\nTrust, Community, and Automatic Updates\nWordPress shipped in October what is perhaps its most polarizing feature ever \u2014 automatic updates in the background of self-hosted web software, on by default and no easy way to turn it off. In most open source communities, this would be cause for open revolt. Learn how through trust, communication, and a steadfast commitment to its philosophies, the WordPress core team convinced a skeptical community to go along, even if it meant users giving up some control.\nWordPress contributors Mel Choyce and Aaron Jorbin also both submitted proposals:\u00a0My Journey into Open Source Design and Modernizing a Stagnant Toolbox.\n\n\nPosted on April 15, 2014April 29, 2014Tags Open Source Bridge, speaking, WordPress1 Comment on My Talk Proposals for Open Source Bridge \n\n\nPosts navigation\nPage 1\nPage 2\n\u2026\nPage 17\nNext page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tProudly powered by WordPress\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
