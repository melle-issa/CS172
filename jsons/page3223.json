For nearly two decades, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve continually refined a unique set of tools and methods to fundamentally reduce complexity, and make project management more of a joy and less of a chore. Perfected and pressure-tested by hundreds of thousands of teams on millions of projects, Basecamp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the gold standard for a simpler, superior version of project management.\nAs Tobi L\u00c3\u00bctke, Shopify\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used Basecamp for a million projects over the last decade and a half.

Highly recommended.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBasecamp works because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the easiest place for everyone in every role to put the stuff, work on the stuff, discuss the stuff, decide on the stuff, and deliver the stuff that makes up every project. Not on separate platforms scattered in various places, but all intuitively organized in one centralized place where everyone can work together, no matter if work is in an office or remote.\nBasecamp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intentionally simple by design.

Complexity doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work. Basecamp does. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why those that leave end up coming back and sticking with us the second time around.
