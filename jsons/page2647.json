The Campus Safety Act, also known as the Jeanne Clery Act, requires universities to report annual crime statistics, provide timely warnings of serious crimes when there may be a threat to others, and to keep a public log of campus incidents. SDSU is in full compliance with this federal mandate, and our Safety and Security Report is available to the entire campus community.\nA paper copy of Annual Security Reports are available upon request by contacting the University Police Department by calling 619-594-1991 or by emailing [email\u00a0protected]\u00a0\n\n2022 Campus Safety Plan \n2022 ASR San Diego Campus, SDSU Imperial Valley, and SDSU Georgia \u00a0\nAnnual Systemwide Report on Hate Incidents on Campus\u00a0\n\nFire Reports\u00a0\nThe Office of Housing Administration and the Residential Education Office publish the annual Fire Safety Report for the SDSU residential community.
