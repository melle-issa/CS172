Stationed at a booth provided by the City of Anaheim in a neighborhood parking lot or apartment complex courtyard, he administers COVID-19 vaccinations at pop-up sites in communities that are experiencing lower vaccination rates and more limited vaccine access.\u00a0\nLocal Partnership Brings Event \u201cto People\u2019s Front Yards\u201d\nA man sits for observation after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine at the Chapman School of Pharmacy\u2019s pop-up vaccination booth, organized in partnership with the City of Anaheim.\nThey have administered nearly 100 doses to residents as young as 12 years old.\n\u201cIt has been a great partnership. The city identified neighborhoods that need resources and have low vaccination rates,\u201d Hess explains. \u201cThese events are literally in people\u2019s front yards and parking lots in order to make the mobile resource fairs more visible to everyone so they can get the help and information that they need.\u201d\nIn a statement, the City of Anaheim says it launched the Mobile Resource Center Project to meet \u201cthe most immediate needs of Anaheim residents that have endured economic and financial hardship throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d Other city departments represented in the effort include public utilities, workforce development, fire and rescue, police, community services and the public library.\nHess also notes that the city has provided translators to help Spanish-speaking individuals ask questions about the vaccine and to assist with filling out forms.\n\u00a0Meeting the Community Where It Is on Vaccine Hesitancy\nEven with the vaccinations widely available to all adults and children as young as 12, Hess notes that these pop-up events are essential for getting both resource-strapped and vaccine-hesitant individuals to opt in.\nHess says that many residents are waiting to see if their friends have any vaccine side effects before opting in themselves or are simply fearful about the vaccination. To meet residents where they are, he notes the importance of having members from within the community vouch for the vaccine.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat has really worked well is having people in these neighborhoods stay at the booth and talk to their neighbors \u2013 their opinion goes further than a city authority or me in my white coat. It\u2019s more effective from a neighbor\u2019s perspective, from a community leader,\u201d Hess says, adding, \u201cthat is the biggest impact we can make\u2014finding partnerships and working with the city to find these people. Everyone should be getting vaccinated.\u201d\nRead more about Chapman\u2019s efforts in the fight against COVID-19 here.\n\n\nChapman School of Pharmacy community outreach covid 19 COVID-19 vaccine Vaccine hesitancy \n\n\n\n\n \n\nRachel Morrison \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018I Didn\u2019t Know That \u2026\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Health Economist Hillard Kaplan Earns Lifetime Achievement Award\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPA Program Breaks Top 100 in First US News Ranking Chapman University\u2019s physician assistant program broke the top 100 in its first-ever ranking in U.S. News & World Report\u2019s Best Health Schools.
