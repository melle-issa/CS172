The ASSU provides funding to over five hundred volunteer student organizations (VSO). These organizations in turn provide the majority of cultural, political, recreational and religious programming for the entire campus. The financial independence that the ASSU affords student organizations is one of the founding principles of the organization.The ASSU also works to represent the interests, needs and perspectives of Stanford students at every level of decision making within the university. The ASSU advocates on behalf of Stanford students on issues such as cost of living, diversity, student life and student activities space.Each year the ASSU pursues innovative projects and creates new services that will improve the quality of student life offered at Stanford. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Government Public Meetings \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduate Student Council (GSC) MeetingsTuesdays at 6 PM PT at EVGR B170 and ZoomZoom linkPassword: 706762 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Senate (UGS) Meetings\nTuesdays at 6:30 PM PT at OU 104 and Zoom, Weeks 1 through 9.\nZoom link\nPassword: 723377\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGSC Funding Committee Meetings\nMondays at TBD\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUGS Appropriations Office HoursCalendarZoom linkPassword:\u00a0723377 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Involved \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalendar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nContact Us\nCalendar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
