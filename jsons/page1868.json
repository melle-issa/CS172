Recruiting Outstanding Diverse Faculty Members\n\n\n\nChapman University created the Faculty Diversification Initiative (FDI) in 2020 as part of its commitment to diversifying the Chapman faculty. The initiative creates a focused funding and recruitment process to identify and employ outstanding minority faculty members, with the goal of hiring two to three new diverse faculty members per year.\n\u201cThe Chapman student population continues to get more diverse, and to meet the needs of those students it is important to have a more diverse faculty,\u201d said Lawrence \u201cLB\u201d Brown, Pharm.D, Ph.D, professor of pharmaceutical economics and policy and presidential advisor on faculty diversification at Chapman University. \u201cOutstanding, diverse faculty also bring unique additions to research, course offerings, pedagogy and the creative arts. Since Chapman has fewer Black faculty than we do Hispanic or Latinx faculty, the initial focus has been on hiring Black faculty.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead More\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Holds Inaugural MLK Community Award Reception\n\n\n\nWhen Shaykh Jibreel Speight gave the invocation at Chapman University\u2019s inaugural Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Award Reception on Jan. 17, he noted it was also the birthday of another Black \u201cfighter,\u201d Muhammad Ali.\nThe event, which will be held annually the day after the federal holiday, recognizes a faculty member, a staff member and a student organization who are \u201ckeeping Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s dream alive.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead More\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Black Book Nook Fostering education and community engagement with Black history, thought, literature, and culture\n\n\n\nOn Friday, November 4, 2022, the Leatherby Libraries and Office of\u00a0Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\u00a0celebrated the launch of the Black Book Nook on the first floor of the library.\nThe Black Book Nook Collection fosters education and community engagement with Black history, thought, literature, and culture.
