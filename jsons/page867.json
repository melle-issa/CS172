Some of the fossil beds found there are the size of a tennis court.\u00a0\nExploring this land with her students for more than two decades, Professor Mary Droser has generated dozens of publications and uncovered strange, ancient animals previously unknown to science.\u00a0\nGiven the prominence of her discoveries, Australian officials signed a memorandum of understanding in 2019 supporting Droser and other UCR researchers in their continued work on the roughly 148,000 acres of land now owned by the government.\u00a0\nOn signing the agreement, the then South Australian Premier Steven Marshall said, \u201cProfessor Droser\u2019s research has contributed greatly to the global significance of the Nilpena site. She and her colleagues at UCR have an important role to play in preserving this land and in continuing to explore it for clues about Earth\u2019s ancient past.\u201d\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nFossil beds at Nilpena Ediacara National Park. (Droser Lab/UCR)\n\n\nThe government has now expanded access to the land and its treasures to the public at large, with the opening today of the park.\n\u201cUCR has had a presence at Nilpena for over 20 years, and this park is the culmination of a lot of work my students and I have done there,\u201d Droser said. \u201cTo think this park will exist because of our work \u2014 it\u2019s all very, very exciting!\u201d\nSharing in the enthusiasm is South Australian Minister for Climate, Environment, and Water Susan Close.\n\"We are incredibly excited today about the opening of the national park, which reflects the significance of sustained, globally important research,\" Close said. \"The National Parks & Wildlife Service will manage the land to protect the fossils in perpetuity, and continue access for generations of researchers to explore the beginnings of animal life on our planet.\"\nScientists, students, and fossil enthusiasts can now visit the park\u2019s visitor hub and view fossils up-close as part of an audio-visual fossil experience. Exclusive guided tours to the Nilpena fossil field will also be offered along boardwalks and viewing platforms installed to ensure sustainable access to key sites.\u00a0\n\n \n\n\nRecreation of Dickinsonia, one of the Ediacaran-era animals whose fossilized remains have been found at Nilpena.\n\n\nA series of storms buried the Ediacaran sea floor at Nilpena in layers of sediment, helping preserve sandstone impressions of the soft-bodied animal communities that lived there. These unique conditions allowed Droser and her research partner, James Gehling of the South Australia Museum, to invent a new method for studying fossils.\u00a0\nTypically, paleontologists collect fossils and bring them to a museum for further study. Instead, Droser and Gehling excavate Nilpena fossil beds, flip them over, piece them together like a puzzle and leave them in the field.\u00a0\n\u201cThis way, we\u2019re able to piece together whole ecosystems,\u201d Droser said. \u201cLooking at them is like snorkeling around on the ancient sea floor, instead of looking at a single animal in a fish tank.\u201d\nMore than 40 species of Ediacaran fossils have been discovered at Nilpena, and Droser is convinced there are many more still to be discovered. The scientific community at large appears to agree on its significance.\u00a0\nIn 2021 Nilpena was placed on Australia\u2019s World Heritage Tentative List, and Droser is supporting a bid for full World Heritage List status. The list is part of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\u2019s efforts to identify and preserve places holding outstanding value to humanity.\n\nShare this Article\nMedia Contacts\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nDepartment of Earth and Planetary Sciences\n\n\nScience / Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience / Technology\n\n\n\n\nAI programs consume large volumes of scarce water\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience / Technology\n\n\n\n\nForced water-use cuts made California more waterwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience / Technology\n\n\n\n\nNot such small things: microplastics in our streams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience / Technology\n\n\n\n\nUCR team creates \u201cquantum composites\u201d for various electrical and optical innovations \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of California, Riverside\n\n900 University Ave.\n            Riverside, CA 92521\nTel: (951) 827-1012\n\n\nUCR Library\nCampus Status\nCampus Store\nCareer Opportunities\nDiversity\nMaps and Directions\nVisit UCR\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of California, Riverside\n\n             900 University Ave.\n            Riverside, CA 92521                         \n tel: (951) 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu \n\n\n Find Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n\nUCR News Archive\n\nScience Today\n\nServicio de Informaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1ol\n\nUC Agricultural and Natural Resources news\n\nUC Newsroom\n\nAvailable Feeds\n\nCreator State Podcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Accessibility\nTerms and Conditions\n\u00a9 2023 Regents of the University of California\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us help you with your search\n\n\nEnter your Search Criteria.\n\n\n\nSearch All UCR\n\n\nSearch This Site\n\n\nCancel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
