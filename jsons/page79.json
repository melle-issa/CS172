    "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatershed Review\nEst. 2012\n\n\n\n\nMenu\n\nSkip to content\n\nHomeAbout This Blog\nHistory\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMonthly Archives: February 2015 \n\n\n\nWriter\u2019s Voice Spotlight: Matthew Gavin\u00a0Frank \n\n\n\nCSU, Chico Writer\u2019s Voice is proud to present, poet, travel and food, and nonfiction writer, Matthew Gavin Frank, Thursday, February 26th at 7:30 pm in Colusa 100B. Frank is the author of Barolo (The University of Nebraska Press), a food memoir based on his illegal work in the Italian wine industry, and Pot Farm (The University of Nebraska Press / Bison Books), about his time working on a medical marijuana farm in Northern California. His poetry collections, The Morrow Plots and Sagittarius Agitprop are available from Black Lawrence Press/Dzanc Books. His poetry book, Warranty in Zulu, is available from Barrow Street Press. He is also the author of the chapbooks Four Hours to Mpumalanga (Pudding House Publications), a poetry sequence about his initial visit to his wife\u2019s homeland in rural South Africa, and Aardvark (West Town Press), a poetry sequence that strangely engages the alphabet. Recent work appears in The New Republic, Field, Epoch, The Huffington Post, Crazyhorse, Indiana Review, The Iowa Review, The Poetry Foundation, North American Review, Pleiades, The Best Food Writing and The Best Travel Writing anthologies, Creative Nonfiction, Gastronomica, Plate Magazine, and others.\nFrank\u2019s latest work, his book-length essay,\u00a0Preparing the Ghost, is a creative nonfiction exploration of obsession. The essay\u2019s protagonist, the 19th century Newfoundland reverend, writer, and amateur naturalist, Moses Harvey, is a modern-day Captain Ahab, consumed by his pursuit of one the sea\u2019s most fabled monstrosities, the giant squid. In exhaustive, free-associative lists; in in-depth, anatomical studies; in disturbingly erotic dreams; and, most rarely, in physical form, the giant squid maintains a constant, lurking presence throughout each vignette of the essay.\nHowever, obsession seems to operate on multiple levels in Preparing the Ghost. If a man\u2019s obsession with a monster is the essay\u2019s subject, then a man\u2019s obsession with another man is the mode in which the essay operates. Entire sections of Preparing the Ghost are devoted to exploring Harvey as a character\u2014dissecting his mind, pulling apart his childhood, his origin, piece by piece and hypothesizing the influences and intentions behind the man who\u2014after years of searching, studying, and finally finding the mythological creature of his dreams\u2014slung it over the top bar of his bathtub and snapped a photograph so indelicate, it seems more reminiscent of the dark corners of the internet than the dark depths of the sea.\nMatthew Gavin Frank is visiting campus in support of the Humanities Center\u2019s theme of Food and Culture. His book, Barolo, is a travelogue detailing an American removed from the microwave-centered cuisine of his youth in search of a deeper, richer experience. Frank nurtures a passion for food\u2014and, indeed, life itself\u2014from a rent-free tent in Barolo, Italy, where he hones his passion and palate on the region\u2019s delicacies and transmits them across time and culture with carefully-cultured metaphors and descriptions that left this reader grumbling for a meal well outside his student budget. Most notably, it is Frank\u2019s pride in life that shines through the brightest. Barolo\u2014like its namesake\u2014is a fulfilling experience unto itself.\nCheck out Frank\u2019s website and his essay, \u201cQualifications on Twenty Things Said About Dover Cake\u201d from issue 35.2 of Watershed Review.\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Matthew Gavin Frank, Thursday, February 26th at 7:30 pm in Colusa 100B. Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts and the Humanities Center, this Writer\u2019s Voice reading is free and open to the public.\nBy Zach Phillips and Matt Skripek\n\n \n\nFebruary 24, 2015watershedcsuc\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nWriter\u2019s Voice Spotlight: Christopher\u00a0Cokinos \n\n\n\nCSU, Chico Writer\u2019s Voice is proud to present, naturalist, poet, and nonfiction writer, Christopher Cokinos, Thursday February 19th at 7:30pm in Colusa 100A.\nCokinos\u2019 writing expresses concerns on many issues\u2013climate change (especially geo-engineering), extinction, traditional natural history, space sciences, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and improving science communications. One recent afternoon, I sat on my back porch, among the trees, the bugs, the deer and the visiting foxes in order to fully experienced Cokinos\u2019 book, Bodies, of the Holocene. In this book you start your journey quietly immersed in the healing heartbreak of nature and poetical prose. I remember thinking I\u2019ve never read anything quite like this before. But, I can handle it. It\u2019s a book of lyrical prose, after all. But the work escapes those boundaries and becomes your world. Through it, I was able to see the expanding sky with its joys and dangers. Experience the incredible loneliness of pain and separation and not turn away. I was hooked. The speaker in this book is hurting and he turns toward and relies upon the prairie of eastern Kansas to experience and come to terms with that pain. You can see yourself in his words. It was sunset by the time I turned the final page and completed our journey. I can\u2019t wait to meet the author.\nCokinos is an author, a poet, a professor, and the Director of the Creative Writing MFA program at the University of Arizona. He has been a crew journalist at the Mars Desert Research Station, and a researcher on a journey that brought 600 miles north of Artic circle to the South Pole. Currently he is an Udall Center Environmental Policy Fellow, and an Associate Professor of English at the University of Arizona. His writing has won many awards, including, the Jon Burroughs Prize for Best Nature Essay (2007), a National Science foundation Antarctic visiting Artist and Writer Fellowship and the Sigurd Olson Nature Writing Award.\nChristopher Cokinos is the author many works, including The Fallen Sky: An Intimate History of Shooting Stars (Tarcher/Penguin), and Hope Is the Thing with Feathers: A Personal Chronicle of Vanished Birds (Tarcher/Penguin). With Eric Magrane, he has co-edited an anthology of contemporary nature writing called A Literary Field Guide to the Sonoran Desert (Arizona, 2016). Conkinos contributes essays to High Country News, and the Los Angeles Times. His current projects include Recivilization: Six Heresies to Keep a Planet Running. Which is an essay collection on massive technological approaches to contemporary environmental conditions. His work has been featured in a wide variety of venues, such as The Chicago Tribune, The New Yorker, The New York Times, The American Scholar, Science, and All Things Considered.\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Christopher Cokinos, Thursday February 19th at 7:30pm in Colusa 100A.
