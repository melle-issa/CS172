Initially, the Phelan resident started out as a math major with plans to ultimately become a high school math teacher. \n\u201cWhen I became a tutor (at CSUSB), and am still currently in University Hall for math and physics, my path changed slightly with wanting to open as many doors as possible,\u201d said Lacy. \u201cWith tutoring being similar to teaching, I thought, \u2018What else can I potentially do for a career?\u2019 With math being my major at the time, physics was something closely related that I thought I would give a shot, and I fell in love with physical systems and how it\u2019s related to math.\u201d\nHe changed his major to physics after completing a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at CSUSB, which was designed to actively involve undergraduates in significant mathematical research \u2013 particularly from underrepresented groups or from institutions where research opportunities are limited \u2013 increase students\u2019 mathematical independence and maturity, and encourage participants to pursue mathematical careers in both industry and academia, and to offer continued mentorship beyond the program.\nIt was around this time that Lacy began facing some serious health problems in being diagnosed with ulcerative colitis.\n\u201cIt took a couple emergency room visits before I was on the right treatment, but once I was being treated, I became really interested in how medicine and biological processes work, which led to me taking biology classes and pursuing the biology minor,\u201d Lacy said.\nThat interest has set Lacy on his ultimate objective.\n\u201cAfter I finish my bachelor\u2019s degree I will be working on my Ph.D. for biomedical engineering (BME) at University of Vermont (UVM) with the goal of trying to be a leading researcher on my disease and professor in the BME field,\u201d he said.\nLacy decided to pursue the BME field while at a summer REU program at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, where he participated in biomedical engineering research. He credits Sara Callori, an associate professor of physics and astronomy at CSUSB, for helping him get into the REU program.\nCallori, who has known Lacy through various courses, advising and research, said that the budding researcher is a strong student not only due to his innate intelligence, but his determination and hardworking attitude.\nIn a letter of recommendation to a Ph.D. program, Callori wrote that Lacy has done \u201can excellent job of developing both his academic strengths and extracurricular activities towards the aim of entering a graduate program (and eventually pursuing a career) in biomedical engineering.\n\u201cHe has had a number of research experiences in both physics and biology that have given him a wide range of technical skills and knowledge, from working with instrumentation and electronics to bench-top biology lab work.\u201d \nCallori added that Lacy\u2019s medical condition motivated him into the biomedical field and inspired him to hone his knowledge and skill set. Whenever he had to miss class from the ailment, he always communicated with her in a timely manner and never once asked for extensions of special consideration, though she added that he would be justified in doing so.\nShe said that Lacy is also receiving virtually no financial support for his education. Because of this, he has taken as many hours a math and physics tutor can get. Callori said there have been nights where his tutoring shift has run late and he slept at the library because of an early class the next morning. \n\u201cJacob pushes himself incredibly hard and when I\u2019ve talked with him about how things are going, he has made it clear that his hard work is in service of his goal of pursuing a Ph.D.,\u201d Callori said.\nLacy said that along with Callori, biology associate professor Jeremy Dodsworth helped develop his skills and confidence as a researcher, and acknowledged David Reyes, the tutorial program coordinator in the Academic Centers for Excellence, for his help in the teaching aspect and in becoming a tutor.\nHe credited his family with deciding to come to college. \u201cThey have always seen the value of education,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dad has always pushed me to achieve more, and I still stand by that.\u201d\nHe said he chose CSUSB after his mother received a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science, a teaching credential and a master\u2019s degree in social science concentration in political economy. \u201cSeeing her do well at this school gave me a reason to go here,\u201d Lacy said. \u201cShe also took me to the campus a lot when growing up while working on her higher education here, and enjoyed the beautiful campus.\u201d\nLacy would encourage high school students to come to CSUSB.\n\u201cIf the degree you are interested in isn\u2019t listed, don\u2019t let that shy you away from attending here,\u201d Lacy said. \u201cI had no idea what biomedical engineering was and even though it\u2019s not listed for CSUSB, I was still able to pursue a career in it.\u201d \nHe added that the university, especially the astronomy and physics department, excels at offering various skills for the students.\n\u201cThe physics department is really good at helping me as well as other students for giving them the skills for fields like biomedical engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, even though this is a school that doesn\u2019t offer degrees for these careers,\u201d Lacy said.\nHe said there were also more opportunities at CSUSB for undergraduates.\n\u201cThinking of bigger institutions like UCR where there\u2019s a lot more students in your class, it will be more competitive to get something like a research position,\u201d he said. \u201cAt CSUSB, not only are there plenty of research opportunities on campus, but at other places such as Nebraska, New York, New Zealand and now Washington! All because of the professors here at CSUSB!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore: \n\n\nphysics\n\n\nJacob Lacy\n\n\nbiomedical engineering\n\n\nPh.D. program\n\n\nUniversity of Vermont\n\n\nresearch\n\n\nResearch Experience for Undergraduates\n\n\nastronomy and physics\n\n\nbiology\n\n\nJeremy Dodsworth\n\n\nCollege of Natural Sciences\n\n\nDavid Reyes\n\n\nAcademic Centers for Excellence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 18, 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUniversity awarded DOE grant to research high energy physics\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 21, 2022\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFaculty in the News, July 19-21\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 6, 2022\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFaculty in the News, May 6\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Region\n\n\n\nCSUSB\n\n\nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino\n5500 University Parkway\nSan Bernardino, CA 92407\n+1 (909) 537-5000\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Social Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso of InterestSan Bernardino Public  University Graduate StudiesSan Bernardino University AdmissionFinancial Aid and Scholarships in San Bernardino \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1 \n\n\n\n\nLogin\n\n\n\n\nmyCoyote\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\nStudent Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB  \nDrupal Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Interest to...\n\n\n\n\nFuture Students\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Students\n   Interests\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nFull-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nPart-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & Visitors\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nAlumni & Friends\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Partners\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nMilitary/Veterans\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 2 \n\n\n\n\nEmployment\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB \nJob Listings\n - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nFaculty Jobs\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nCareer Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHuman Resources\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Employment\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nContact\n  CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nClery Act\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Safety Reports\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTitle IX Notice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure of Consumer Information\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 3 \n\n\n\n\nCampus Services\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Advising\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHousing & Residential Life\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nOmbuds Services\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nParking\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPolice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPsychological Counseling\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nServices to Students with Disabilities\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Health Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Support\n\n\n\n\nTranscripts\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\n\n\n\nNon-Discrimination Notice\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Copyright/DMCA Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
