I woke up early and was watching Youtube videos in bed before my daily venture downstairs to make breakfast when I saw a new video from PBS Digital Studios, which releases a series of studies regarding certain facets of the literary world in a series called \u201cIt\u2019s Lit!\u201d It just so happened that on this day, they were discussing \u201cDeath, Personified.\u201d I watched, in awe, as they listed the endless examples of authors crafting \u201cDeath\u201d a physical character. I began to wonder: Why are writers so fascinated with death? I decided to launch a personal investigation and go in search of the truth behind this phenomenon.\nSo I asked professors and graduate students in the CSUC English department, what about the theme of mortality makes it such a rich muse for writers? I began to notice a trend in their answers. Most agreed the use of death and its symbolism in literature is an inevitable constant. Professor Matt Brown, who focuses on American Literature and Culture in his courses, offered, \u201cDeath may be the only universal human experience and nobody in the world can tell us what it\u2019s like.\u201d In this way, Professor Brown believes personifying death gives readers a way to feel closer to understanding death as a whole, without having to experience it firsthand. \nGrad student, Mary Gibaldi, who focuses on 20th-century American Literature and Feminist Theory, went a step further with her interpretation: \u201cNot only is death an inevitable part of life, but it is often linked to other themes writers tend to gravitate towards power, identity, the social and socioeconomic spaces created after a person\u2019s passing.\u201d Upon speculation, these themes, in correspondence with one another, is what drives most plots in stories. Death, especially, serves as an unwanted change that forces the reader to be more open-minded and grow in some way. \nInterestingly, Professor Jeanne Clark and Professor Rob Davidson, who both teach creative writing, gave a more poetic answer to the question. Clark reported, \u201cIt\u2019s inevitability. The way it forces us to ask the hardest questions, to make meaning of suffering, to find consolation; it takes us to our edge. The ways it opens our hearts & minds.\u201d Davidson added, \u201cSurely the inescapable nature of our own demise\u2014we are endlessly fascinated with questions of what death means, what happens after death, how death gives shape & meaning to our lives, and of course what one\u2019s own death might mean: a reckoning, a release, an apocalypse, a rebirth.\u201d The mere intricacy of these explanations adds the type of reasoning only a creative writer could offer. Somehow, their perspectives paint the concept of death as a vital and beautiful aspect of life. \nPerhaps, in this way, it has managed to remain timelessly relevant in all genres of literature. While this question may never be truly answered, this at least gives me some idea about why writers remain fascinated with Death. \n\u00a0\nFaculty Recommendations:\nMary Gibaldi: Daniel Woodrell\u2019s Winter\u2019s Bone, Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved\nProfessor Matt Brown: There are dead bodies all over almost everything I read or teach. Leaves of Grass has 15 corpses in it and it is, by far, the most cheerful and optimistic text I teach. Nearly everyone dies in Moby Dick. And of course, the blues songs and Appalachian ballads I love so much are all populated by murderers and the murdered.\nProfessor Jeanne Clark: Elegy, Edward Hirsh;\u00a0Elegy, Mary Jo Bang;\u00a0The Duino Elegies, Rainer Maria Rilke;\u00a0Brother, Matthew & Michael Dickman;\u00a0Death Tractates & Bright Existence, Brenda Hillman;\u00a0Trapeze, Deborah Digges;\u00a0Prayer in Wind, Eva Saulitis\nProfessor Rob Davidson: Dante quickly comes to mind. Faulkner\u2019s As I Lay Dying. From more contemporary authors, I am enormously fond of George Saunders. His story \u201cSea Oak\u201d is a zombie story in which a woman who, in her mortal life, was a passive pushover; as a zombie, she seeks lovers and adventure\u2014death becomes, for her, an opportunity for a \u201cdo-over.\u201d Sadly, it doesn\u2019t work out, but Saunders\u2019s moral is clear: carpe diem.\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nMay 1, 2019watershedcsuc\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll\n\nDiscuss\nGet Inspired\nGet Polling\nGet Support\nLearn WordPress.com\nTheme Showcase\nWordPress Planet\nWordPress.com News\n\n\nTopics\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nUpcoming Events No upcoming events\nArchives\n\nMay 2022\nMarch 2022\nMay 2020\nOctober 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nOctober 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nApril 2017\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nDecember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nApril 2014\nFebruary 2014\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nAugust 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\n\n \n\nFollow me on TwitterMy Tweets \n\n\n\n\nCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
