Landmarks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB Traditions and Landmarks\nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino has a rich 50-plus year history that includes a fast increase in enrollment from 230 to over 20,000 students. Many campus traditions and landmarks have been established as a result of our fast expansion. Students who wish to make a difference and create new traditions should join the\u00a0Associate Student's Incorporated, the student body's voice. Traditions at CSUSB convey the tale of the university's legacy, commemorate its past, and unite generations of Coyotes in a common experience that transcends time, culture, and trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlma Mater\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\u201cSan Bernardino, Our Alma Mater\u201d originally was composed by Dr. Loren Filbeck (professor emeritus of music) in 1988 and debuted on October 27, 1990, at the university\u2019s Silver Anniversary Gala. Today, it is a campus tradition for the graduating class to sing the alma mater at the close of the commencement ceremonies.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsk Me Campaign\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDuring the first week of each semester, students can stop by our \"Ask Me!\" booths to receive directions, ask questions, and grab a quick snack. Faculty, staff, and administrators volunteer to man the Ask Me! booths and assist students in navigating CSUSB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBlack and Blue\n\t\t\t\t\t\nOriginally adopted by a student vote in 1966 the official colors of CSUSB were brown and light blue to reflect the mountains and sky that makeup the campus' backdrop. In 1996, the administrative council changed the school colors to black and blue and in 2008 we adopted \"Coyote Blue\" as the official name to our shade of blue!\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCody the Coyote\n\t\t\t\t\t\nIn 1984, after years of unofficially having a St. Bernard as a mascot, students took to the polls and voted to name the Coyote as the official mascot. Today, Cody can be found all over campus taking selfies\u00a0and making students smile at different programs and events. Keep up with him and his whereabouts on Instagram @codythecoyote65!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCommencement\n\t\t\t\t\t\nCommencement ceremonies at CSUSB are held twice a year: the Fall Commencement ceremony takes place in December and the Spring Commencement ceremony takes place in June. During commencement, we commemorate and congratulate our graduates on their achievements!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConvocation\n\t\t\t\t\t\nFirst-Year Experience and the Associated Students, Inc. co-host our annual New Student Convocation. First-year Coyotes are invited to a celebration with motivating speakers, thrilling awards, and more!
