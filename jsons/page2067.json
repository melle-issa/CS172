Password management is self-service and\n                     recoverable through a variety of options, all selected and managed by you.*Note: If you are a student and an employee, you will be provided with a student role\n                     SDSUid and an employee role SDSUid. Applicants are not provided with an SDSU email\n                     until they become an enrolled student.\nUse your SDSUid to access SDSU Gmail the campus standard for communication and collaboration.\u00a0 Learn more about\u00a0Google Workspace.\nNote!\u00a0In accordance with the SDSU policy, passed by the University Senate, all official communications\n                        from the university shall be sent to student's official SDSU email addresses (e.g.\n                        [email\u00a0protected]). Students are responsible for checking their official university\n                        email addresses to stay current with SDSU communications. Learn more about the Student Official Email Address Use Policy here.\nIf you would like to change your SDSUid password or manage your Microsoft online service\n                     settings, after signing in, click the gear icon in the Microsoft 365 Portal, or use\n                     the link below to take you directly to the change password screen.\u00a0\nChange SDSUid Password\nImportant: To change your SDSUid password recovery options (security questions, phone\n                     number, email address, etc): go to SDSUid user profile management..\nActivate Your SDSUid\nAutomated Onboarding Process:\nSDSUid is created automatically. Faculty/Staff/Student Employee affiliations are created\n                     through the on-boarding process that starts with HR. Students and admitted applicants\n                     are provided an SDSUid when they are admitted to SDSU. Once our records indicate a\n                     student is no longer enrolled, the SDSUid and all associated data will be deleted.\n                     Once keyed in by HR or entered into the enrollment system, the account information\n                     is synchronized to SDSUid. An email from [email\u00a0protected] will be sent to\n                     your personal email address (e.g. [email\u00a0protected]) \u200bwith a temporary activation code\n                     and instructions.\nIf you have not activated your SDSUid, instructions can be found at:SDSUid Activation\nNeed help with SDSUid?
