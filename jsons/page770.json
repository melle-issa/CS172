Below are ten highly effective ways to safeguard systems and information.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nUnderstand Stanford\u2019s Risk Classifications\n\n\nStanford uses a three-tier classification model (Low Risk, Moderate Risk, and High Risk) for categorizing data and systems by risk level. Understanding these classifications and how they apply to you is the first step in protecting yourself and Stanford.\n\n\n\n\nRecognize phishing and other social engineering attacks\n\n\nMost often motivated by financial gain, hackers frequently employ social engineering techniques to gain unauthorized access to data and accounts via email (\u201cphishing\u201d), text messaging (\u201csmishing\u201d), phone (\u201cvishing\u201d), or online services such as social networking.\nTo avoid becoming a victim, never provide personal information in response to an unsolicited email, phone, text message or letter, even if it appears to be from a friend or colleague. If unsure, contact the purported senders using information from their official website, as opposed to information provided in the unsolicited communication.\nYou can protect yourself and Stanford by learning to recognize a phishing email and reporting any suspicious email to spam@stanford.edu.\nPhishing Awareness Program\nThe phishing awareness program periodically sends an email to each participant that resembles a phishing message. It\u2019s designed to create a safe, educational environment for a recipient to practice phishing email identification with no penalty to them, or their department, if a link is clicked. Individual results will never be reported.\n\n\n\n\nKeep your software up-to-date\n\n\nNew vulnerabilities in operating systems, web browsers, and other software are discovered daily. Updating software frequently prevents these vulnerabilities from being exploited.\nBigFix is a broadly used service at Stanford that helps keep your laptop or desktop computer up-to-date. If unsure whether BigFix is already installed or needs to be installed on your machine, contact your local IT support team.\n\n\n\n\nBack up your devices\n\n\nBacking up your files protects your data against ransomware, accidental loss, and system failures. CrashPlan is Stanford\u2019s recommended backup and recovery service for laptops and desktops. If unsure whether CrashPlan is already installed or needs to be installed on your machine, contact your local IT support team.\n\n\n\n\nEncrypt your devices\n\n\nEncryption protects your personal information and Stanford\u2019s data to prevent unauthorized access in the event that the device is lost or stolen. The MyDevices website tracks your registered devices and their compliance statuses. The encryption guide walks you through the process of encrypting your devices.\n\n\n\n\nProtect against malicious software\n\n\nTo protect against malicious software, install Stanford\u2019s recommended antivirus software on your computer. If unsure whether an antivirus software is already installed or needs to be installed on your machine, contact your local IT support team.\n\n\n\n\nUse approved Stanford services\n\n\nThe Risk Classifications website lists approved Stanford services corresponding to each risk level. Consult with your IT support team before using services that are not listed.\nTo get started using Stanford supported software, visit University IT\u2019s Essential Stanford Software website.\n\n\n\n\nUse a password manager\n\n\nIt is a best practice to use unique and strong passwords for each of your online accounts. Password managers facilitate the generation and secure storage of passwords. They also save you time and trouble by requiring you to remember only one master password to access the password manager.\n\n\n\n\nUse secure email\n\n\nWhen sending sensitive information (especially High Risk Data) via email, add \u201cSecure:\u201d to the subject line, even when sending within Stanford. \u201cSecure:\u201d ensures that the message is sent securely to prevent unauthorized access. For sharing protected health information (PHI), use the Stanford Medicine Box.\n\n\n\n\nReport lost or stolen devices\n\n\nIf one of the devices used for your Stanford work (whether personally or Stanford owned) has been lost or stolen, report the incident to the University Privacy Office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n Services\n Explore all services\nCloud Solutions Q&As \nGet started with IT\nPractice secure computing\nTechnology Toolkit for Telecommuting and Remote Work\nIT perks\n \n\n Support\n Find answers\nRequest something\nGet help\nView system and project status\nBrowser recommendations\n \n\n University IT\n About us\nOrganization chart\nCurrent job openings\n \n\n Connect\n News\nEvents\nCommunities of Practice\nUIT Community (UIT staff only)\n \n\n UIT Web Editors\n Login \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Home\nMaps & Directions\nSearch Stanford\nEmergency Info\n\n\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright Complaints\nTrademark Notice\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Stanford University.
