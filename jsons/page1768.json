You\u2019d love to see more diversity represented, but people are either not showing up \u2014 or they attend once and don\u2019t come back. What can you do to be a good ally to foster, promote, and support diversity and an inclusive space?\nThis workshop is beneficial for all levels of Diversity and Inclusion knowledge, from complete beginners to experienced event organizers who are already incorporating good practises.\nIn this workshop, we\u2019ll cover 5 topics:\n1. Mindset Shift: Shifting the way you think about diversity\n2. Community: How to attract and foster a diverse community\n3. Environment: Creating a welcoming environment, both in person and online\n4. Speakers and Leaders: How to encourage more people from diverse backgrounds to step up to be speakers and leaders\n5. Allyship: How to be a better ally\nYou will walk away with an action list to start making changes right away!\nWe will be watching the videos on Learn WordPress and stopping to do the exercises in the workbook PDF together.\nIn order to create a space where people can feel supported to talk through real life challenges, this watch party workshop will NOT be recorded.\nThis workshop was created by Allie Nimmons, Aurooba Ahmed, David Wolfpaw, and Jill Binder for WordCamp US 2019.\nPlease try to arrive 10 minutes early so that we can start on time.\nAfter the workshop, to help you take action and overcome challenges, there will be a follow-up discussion in the #community-events channel in the WordPress Slack a month later at the same time and day of the week.\nTestimonials:\n\u201cI love how actionable the workshop is.\u201d\n\u2013 Anonymous\n\u201cI loved being with other organizers and hearing what they\u2019ve done. The checklists in the workbook are helpful in terms of tracking what I have done and what I can still improve. I\u2019d love to see ALL THE ORGANIZERS go through this. This felt like a great complement to other material that WordPress has about not disparaging people; the focus of the Allyship workshop was on how to be actively welcoming.\u201d\n\u2013 Sallie Goetsch, organizer, East Bay WordPress Meetup\n\u201cI thought I was holding inclusive events already, and this workshop showed me ways to make things even more inclusive that I hadn\u2019t thought of before. I especially liked learning that changing just a few words can make my Meetups and WordCamps even more welcoming to more people.\u201d\n\u2013 Shanta R.
