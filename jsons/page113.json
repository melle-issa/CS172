Because doing so would involve bypassing an election, we have informed the SGWU that we do not agree to this request.\nWe believe that a secret-ballot election is a fundamental principle of democratic decision-making and is the most inclusive, fair, and secure method by which to determine whether a majority of eligible graduate students wish to be represented by a union. We feel strongly that every graduate student should have the ability, free from undue influence, to make this decision on their own.\nAs a next step, we anticipate the SGWU will file a petition with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) asking it to schedule and supervise an election. We expect an election will be held in a matter of weeks.\nWe encourage all eligible graduate students to educate themselves about the collective bargaining process and what it would mean for them to be in a union, and then exercise their right to vote in the election. The university is continuing to provide factual information for our community through this website, which has been updated recently with additional FAQs specific to the union election.\nAs we have stated previously, as Stanford leaders we greatly value the many contributions our graduate students make to Stanford\u2019s mission of teaching and research. We will continue working to understand, appreciate, and be responsive to the needs of our graduate students, so that we may foster their well-being throughout their time at Stanford.\nWe encourage everyone in our community, particularly those eligible to vote in the election, to learn about the issues relevant to this consequential election and to support a fair and well-informed election process.\nSincerely,\nMarc Tessier-Lavigne\nPresident\nPersis Drell\nProvost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice Of The President\nUniversity Affairs\nInstitutional News\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to read next:\n\n\n\n\n \nAcademic Council\nReport of the president: Academic Council Professoriate appointments\nThe following Academic Council Professoriate appointments, promotions, and reappointments for the periods indicated were reviewed by the Advisory Board of the Academic Council on Jan. 17, Jan. 31, Feb. 7, Feb. 21, Feb. 28, and March 7, 2023, and were approved by the president.
