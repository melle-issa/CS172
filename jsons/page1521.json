First of all, chairs. I missed chairs the most, and secondly couches. \u00a0\u00a0But the third thing I missed in basic training was books. \u00a0We were only allowed a holy book of our choice (looking back on things, I should have made a case for Allen Ginsberg), and the standard issue Blue Jackets Manual (which we lovingly dubbed The Blow Jobs Manual). \u00a0Up to that point, having access to literature was something I had taken for granted. \u00a0Yeah sure, Mark and John and Luke tried to fill the void, and sure, I thought they wrote some pretty good books, \u00a0but I was longing for stimulation.\nThe first thing I did when I graduated from boot camp and was sent to Pensacola, Florida for training, was take a walk down to the little base library. \u00a0I didn\u2019t know what I was looking for, and they didn\u2019t have any Classic Comics (or Playboys). \u00a0I grabbed a novel I found standing open on top of the meager little shelf of literary novels. \u00a0\u00a0I liked the art deco scene of an embracing couple which graced its front. \u00a0You heard me right, I picked it because I liked the cover. \u00a0That novel turned out to be Michael Ondaatje\u2019s In the Skin of a Lion, and it blew me away.\nI\u2019d never knew that one could blend poetry and prose. \u00a0I wasn\u2019t even exactly sure what prose was, and as for poetry, as Lew Welch once said, \u201ctwelve years of education had done its best to convince me that I don\u2019t like it.\u201d \u00a0Why isn\u2019t Ondaatje using quotation marks? \u00a0His characters are experiencing real human emotions like love and pain and inadequacy and I was o.k with that!\nNow this was a revelation.\nShortly after, I purchased my first collection of poetry, The Collected Poems of Nazim Hikmet. They were accessible. I didn\u2019t feel like I wasn\u2019t getting something. \u00a0I didn\u2019t quite know what I felt, I just knew I liked it. \u00a0Each one of theses poems was saying something more than the sum of its parts, it had (as one professor would later call it) a certain \u201cvoodoo.\u201d \u00a0I was hooked. \u00a0You know you\u2019re hooked when you hear your buddies say, \u201cBro, whenever you drink too much you always wanna\u2019 talk about books.\u201d\nFast forward ten years and here I am. \u00a0I\u2019ve left a career in the Navy, packed up my family and moved back to Northern California because I\u2019d heard that Raymond Carver used to haunt the bars around here. \u00a0I\u2019m learning how to be better at \u201ctalking about books.\u201d \u00a0I have four copies of In the Skin of a Lion just waiting to be passed out to a book club. \u00a0I\u2019m living high on the hog. \u00a0So now, whenever I get a chance, I sit down in my \u00a0comfy chair, and grab a new book. \u00a0Life is good!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But then right in the middle of it\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 comes the smiling\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mortician\nStan Upshaw was born in Eureka, California, and currently lives in Chico, California where he is a student, editor and poet.\u00a0 He will be pursuing an MFA in creative writing in 2014.\u00a0 He lives with his wife, Margie, his daughter, Johanna, and is expecting a son in June.\n\n \n\nApril 30, 2013watershedcsuc\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll\n\nDiscuss\nGet Inspired\nGet Polling\nGet Support\nLearn WordPress.com\nTheme Showcase\nWordPress Planet\nWordPress.com News\n\n\nTopics\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nUpcoming Events No upcoming events\nArchives\n\nMay 2022\nMarch 2022\nMay 2020\nOctober 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nOctober 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nApril 2017\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nDecember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nApril 2014\nFebruary 2014\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nAugust 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\n\n \n\nFollow me on TwitterMy Tweets \n\n\n\n\nCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
