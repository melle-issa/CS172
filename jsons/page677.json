Most typically done when changing hosting companies. of Messages from SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform https://slack.com/. The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at https://make.wordpress.org/chat/. to Matrix\nThe agenda was to discuss a tentative plan for migration from Slack to Matrix. We have identified a successful migration path which consists of moving over the messages in public channels to matrix rooms. All the messages in public channels would be available in their respective Matrix rooms from Day 1 of Matrix. All users would find themselves to be in the right Matrix rooms as per what Slack channels they have joined.\nPrivate conversations (private channels and direct messages) are best handled by user themselves using a browser extension (Firefox / Chrome).\nWe would use SSO (OIDC) to use WordPress.orgWordPress.org The community site where WordPress code is created and shared by the users. This is where you can download the source code for WordPress core, plugins and themes as well as the central location for community conversations and organization.  https://wordpress.org/ account to login onto Matrix. The OpenID Connect Server plugin was built for this purpose.\nDuring the duration of transition, both would be accessible and messages would be relayed from Slack to Matrix and vice-versa using the help of a bridge. As of now, it works by creating a Slack ghost account on Matrix side and we would be trying to make it possible to not need that and just post Slack side messages as messages from the respective Matrix account of those users. Matrix side messages are posted to Slack by a Slack app masquerading as the user, but not accredited to the actual Slack user.\nComment(s) on Agenda post\n\nAlex Stine: When will a test instance be available?
