She suggested parents use, as a tool, the state-mandated School Accountability Report Cards found on school or school district websites.\n\"I just encourage everyone just to ask the questions, to actually do the research and look at the data,\u201c said Paun, who was one of about 30 people who attended the discussion.\nThe event, billed as a community town hall to create a \u201cwelcoming space for discussion between Black students, staff and faculty, as well Black community members in Sonoma County,\u201c was produced by the university\u2019s Hub Cultural Center as part of its Black History Month event schedule. The conversation touched on housing, mental health and finances, but centered on the needs of youth.\n\u201cIt was the perfect beginning to getting some momentum behind the Black community,\u201d said Tramaine Austin-Dillon, the cultural center\u2019s manager, who organized the event with Tina Rogers, a multicultural arts educator. \u201cThere were people there that I had never met. There were people there that I was able to hear their passions and what they're really good at. And so I think now we can be really strategic about how we move forward.\u201d\n\nA common theme among those in the audience who spoke  was that Black youth are treated unfairly in schools, starting in preschool \u2014 and elsewhere.\n\u201cOur young Black kids are suffering,\u201d said N\u2019gam\u00e9 Gray, who heads the grassroots Santa Rosa-based NuBridges Youth Collaborative . \u201cYou know, they can't even go anywhere without being looked at other than as a thug or whatever they are portrayed in the media. Because when they look at us, that's the first thing they see. They don't see the education behind us. They don't see our character, they see the color of our skin, and then they decide what we're going to turn out to be once they start interacting with us.\u201d\nOthers suggested that parents lead Saturday school sessions, and that older community members could step in to support hard-pressed younger families with babysitting and even visits to teachers and school counselors to advocate for students.\n\u201cWhen some of us were growing up, we had that village, that neighborhood,\u201d said Arthur Chaney, president of the nonprofit 100 Black Men of Sonoma County, Inc. \u201cKids don\u2019t have that neighborhood nowadays and so they miss that.\u201d\nUnderlying much of the discussion were painful realities including recent data contained in the 2021 Portrait of Sonoma County that show Black county residents have a life span 10 years shorter than any other ethnic or racial group in the county.\n\u201cThat\u2019s outrageous. There\u2019s something going on. We\u2019re hurting and suffering,\u201d said Claudia de la Pena. \u201cWe all need to come together under one umbrella as a collective and do something about that.\u201d\nEqually present, though, was an appreciation of Black people and culture.\n\u201cI was a preschool teacher at Head Start and I used to beg for Black children in my class because I knew how they were. I knew how they felt. I knew what was needed,\u201d said ReEllis Dotson-Newman. \u201cAnd a lot of times the teachers are not in our mindset. They don't understand our culture \u2026 because we do things different and it's OK.\u201d\nThe crowd applauded when Evette Minor said: \"We have to work for things, right? So it's a give and receive. There are so many things we can do as a community. But it is important to have that sense of community. We have a lot of events going on and Black history is 365. Not just this month. So we need to continue to have the programming and then make sure we show up.\u201c\nAustin-Dillon said that is the plan.\n\u201cEducation was a huge theme that kept coming up. So I want to get a stronger sense of how we can engage that area,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think from a sense of just celebrating Black joy, like being able to have a sense of community in Sonoma County, I want to do more events like this where we can come together.\u201d\n\nYou can reach Staff Writer Jeremy Hay at 707-387-2960 or jeremy.hay@pressdemocrat.com.
