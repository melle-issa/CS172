For Ramirez, like many students, the opinions of others were drowning out her own voice and she had to find it. \u201cRight after high school I went to UCI, mostly because of pressure from everyone around me, including my mom,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a school I wanted to go to personally and I didn\u2019t feel a good connection there. I think it affected me mentally and academically.\u201d\nRamirez was in the social sciences program at UC Irvine, where she began struggling academically. The school dropped her from the program due to her grades. \u201cI became undeclared and I was on academic probation the following semester, so I made the decision to leave.\u201d This led Ramirez to Santa Ana College (SAC), where she planned to study for a year then return to UCI.\n\u201cWhen I got to Santa Ana College, I actually really liked school. I thought, \u2018maybe this is the right way for me to learn,\u2019\u201d she said. Ramirez continued her studies at SAC for three years. It was during the third year that she learned about Chapman\u2019s Transfer Admission Guarantee (C-TAG) for Future Educators program.\u00a0\nC-TAG is designed for students interested in teaching elementary and special education. The program creates a pathway from Santa Ana College or Santiago Canyon College that offers guaranteed admission into Chapman\u2019s Integrated Educational Studies (IES) major. IES majors are future educators for a classroom or community setting.\nFeeling as though the odds were stacked against her, Ramirez was surprised to learn that Chapman was an option for her. \u201cBeing a low-income, first-generation student and a former foster youth, I had a negative mindset. People thought I wouldn\u2019t make it. Especially in a private school,\u201d Ramirez shared. Transferring to Chapman also requires a minimum GPA of 2.7 or higher for required courses, so she had to show her improvement as a student.\nBut Ramirez was confident in her decision. \u201cInstead of listening to what other people think is best for me, this is what I think is best for myself. I know myself better than they do,\u201d she said.\u00a0\n\nNow in her second semester at Chapman, Ramirez is an IES major with a minor in disability studies; and she\u2019s excelling academically. She credits her professors and Chapman\u2019s average class size for contributing to her success. \u201cI love Dr. Wood!\u201d She exclaimed. \u201cShe\u2019s very supportive and caring. If I have questions or need help, she gets back to me right away.\u201d\nDr. Jillian Wood is the director of undergraduate programs and an assistant professor at Chapman. \u201cI had the pleasure of letting Angela Ramirez know she had been accepted to the program. I was thrilled to see she was in my IES 301: Organizations, Ethics, and Society course for her first semester,\u201d said Dr. Wood. \u201cShe was an exceptional student, with strong critical thinking and writing skills. While I had the pleasure of being her instructor, I also got to work with her closely as her program advisor, which I will do throughout her time at Chapman. Angela is truly exceptional and will make an important impact in the field of education.\u201d\nChapman faculty often become integral to their students\u2019 support system. \u201cAt Chapman, I don\u2019t feel like an ID number because the classes don\u2019t have hundreds of students within a course,\u201d said Ramirez. \u201cYou can get to know your professors and they want to get to know you as well. It\u2019s a very strong community to be in.\u201d\u00a0\nRamirez looks forward to graduating and working with students with disabilities. She wants to encourage other students to remain optimistic about their academic journey. \u201cDon\u2019t give up,\u201d she said. \u201cFollow the path that you think is best for you because at the end of the day, this achievement and success is for you.\u201d Ramirez also wants future C-TAG students to take advantage of the resources available at Chapman to help them in their journey to success.\nTo begin your journey as a C-TAG student, SAC and SCC students should contact their academic advisors and/or their respective program centers:\n\nSAC Center for Teacher Education\nSCC Pathways to Teaching Program (PTTP)\n\n\n\nacademic success Attalah College of Educational Studies C-TAG Transfer student \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJennifer Winfield \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngela Bassett to Speak at 2023 Chapman University Commencement\n\n\n\n\n\nFresh Food is Served for Students Observing Ramadan, Passover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership That Spans the Campus Jack of all trades Kyle Tanimura is leaving quite the lasting mark on Chapman, where he has taken on multiple leadership roles as a double major in political science and strategic and corporate communication, with a...\n\n\nMay 1, 2023 Jennifer Winfield\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Pacific Islander Desi American Heritage Month Events at Chapman University Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Heritage Month, which runs from May 1 to 31, celebrates the identities, histories and experiences of the APIDA community.
