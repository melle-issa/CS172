That way previewing revisions styles would have no effect on the global styles the user has, potentially changed or loaded, in the editor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\n\n\n\njasmussen\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 18, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's a good instinct. I wonder if indeed we could show a sort of dots timeline above the scaled down frame, and the items in the sidebar scroll multiple viewports across that timeline.\nThat's a bit of a dreamy scenario which might run into performance issues, and I would imagine we can also keep in place a single frame like you have here, and load different content inside. This is definitely something to explore in the designs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ud83d\udc4d\n1\n ramonjd reacted with thumbs up emoji\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4d\n1 reaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMember\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\nramonjd\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 19, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI wonder if indeed we could show a sort of dots timeline above the scaled down frame, and the items in the sidebar scroll multiple viewports across that timeline\n\nIt might be challenging performance-wise, but I like that idea!!\n\nI would imagine we can also keep in place a single frame like you have here, and load different content inside\n\nI've been playing with this scenario in a PR.

At a later time we can look at the contents of the 3 dot drop down menu to see if some of the options there should be made more visible. As the 3 dot menu options are fairly hidden away and not openly seen.\nWhat is great with this revision system is that it matches the Story Book method which seems like a method that should be used in the general revision system. Post and Site Editor etc. Clicking a revision one sees the change in the canvas area. What happens if one has made a change to something below or above what one sees in the viewport? Will the screen jump to show adjustments made if one for instance made changes to the bottom of the screen? As smaller changes might not be that easy to see.\nI like the wording \"Restore and save selected revision\" as that says directly what one can do.\nI also like seeing the \"Save my unsaved changes\" as that now will become the latest revision seen.\nFrom what I see in the video I would say this is ready to go.\nA later step could be to click some kind of details or down arrow in a revisions button to also see a list of changes that are done. Meaning see the visual change in the canvas and also see a list of changes for a specific revision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u2764\ufe0f\n1\n ramonjd reacted with heart emoji\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n1 reaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\n\n\n\njameskoster\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 19, 2023\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n          edited\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHm, looking at this with fresh eyes I found the video a little confusing.\nWhen you first open the revisions panel there are unsaved changes and there's a warning at the top of the panel saying that if a revisions is restored then those unsaved changes will be lost. Then you change the background, and open the revisions panel again, but this time there's a different UI with the \"Save\" / \"Don't save\" buttons. What's the condition that triggers this different UI?\nI think the design could use some general polish:\n\nI assume the Gravatars are the user who saved the changes?\nRevisions list item states (hover, active).\nGeneral spacing / dimensions of the revisions list items \u2013 are those based on an existing component?\nCopy can be optimised, and there's a typo: \"Restoring a revision will discard this changes\".\nIn the \"Save\" / \"Don't save\" UI both buttons are primary.\n\nIf we need this UI I still think it'd make more sense in a modal\n\n\n\"Restore\" button might need to be fixed to the bottom of the panel, otherwise it'll disappear out of view when the list is really long?\n\nHappy to help with the visual details!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u2764\ufe0f\n2\n ramonjd and jasmussen reacted with heart emoji\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n2 reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMember\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\nramonjd\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 19, 2023\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n          edited\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI appreciate the quick feedback @jameskoster @jasmussen and @paaljoachim Very helpful once again \ud83c\udf7a\nThe demo was hacked together pretty quickly and, yes, needs a major polish, tests  (spellcheck!) and probably split up into a couple of PRs to get the groundwork in. It was just to demonstrate the flow.\nI believe, at least so far, the benefit of this approach is that we can load both styles and block HTML into the preview pane, so it'd be possible to preview template revisions, and mix them with global styles revisions if we wanted to get jiggy with it.\n\nWhen you first open the revisions panel there are unsaved changes and there's a warning at the top of the panel saying that if a revisions is restored then those unsaved changes will be lost. Then you change the background, and open the revisions panel again, but this time there's a different UI with the \"Save\" / \"Don't save\" buttons\n\nYeah, the flow is not intuitive. Most of the work was getting the stylebook-like container to work.\nBasically I'm checking whether the post is \"dirty\", that is, if it has unsaved changes in order to give the user a chance to save them before they restore a revision (which will overwrite those unsaved changes).\nI think I need to trigger the prompt before we go to save a revision. \ud83e\udd37 Anyway, I'm hoping your suggestion of the modal to warn about losing unsaved changes will help make the save path clearer to the user.\nStill a lot of work to do.\n\nI assume the Gravatars are the user who saved the changes?\n\nExactly. I'm grabbing the avatar from the author of each global styles revision.\n\nRevisions list item states\nGeneral spacing / dimensions of the revisions list items \u2013 are those based on an existing component?\n\nAfter I've cleaned up the impossibly messy code and made it presentable, it'd be great to get a design sweep to help tighten up this.\n\nCopy can be optimised, and there's a typo: \"Restoring a revision will discard this changes\".\n\nMy bl0d is typo. \ud83e\udd26\n\nIf we need this UI I still think it'd make more sense in a modal\n\"Restore\" button might need to be fixed to the bottom of the panel, otherwise it'll disappear out of view when the list is really long?\n\nGood call on both. I'll build it in.\n\ncan we land a version of this soon or does the design need time in the oven?\n\nI reckon it'll be easier to test... ultimately... if I split it up into PRs for:\n\nthe new rest endpoint\ngenericizing the stylebook\n(maybe) the changes to the __experimentalGetCurrentGlobalStylesId method\nrevisions UI and related components\n\nI'll try to power through the first 3 today so we can do the important design review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\n\n\n\nSaxonF\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 20, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think I need to trigger the prompt before we go to save a revision\n\n+1 .

I'm assuming we can't split those two actions? 1. Restore revision to see how it feels 2. Save/publish\n\nI agree. It's over complicating the action. I'm experimenting with confining the save state to the editor, and using the revisions view to only preview revisions and load them into the editor.\nThis has an added benefit of allowing users to load the revision and carry on editing, without forcing them into a save flow. I'm running on the argument that a user can decide which state to save and when not to.\n\nScreen cast example\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\n\n\n\njameskoster\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 20, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's excellent work here, and I'd say the bones are mostly in place. It's probably worth a once-over in terms of design though, just to get all the details right. I'll try and find time asap.\nOne question \u2013\u00a0did you consider using the zoomed out view (the same that is invoked when choosing a style variation) rather than the style book 'frame'?

Clearly we don't need to do this when there are no unsaved style changes.\nIf they elect to save, a new style revision is created.\nSelecting any revision other than the most recent makes the changes dirty.\nSaving styles will 'load' the selected revision, combine it with any changes the user has made since selecting it, and create a new point in the timeline.\n\nThere's quite a lot to wrap your head around with this, so I'm almost certainly missing a few things.

One clicks to enter Revisions and all the Revisions are greyed out and only the Discard changes or Save button is seen at the top.\nUser clicks to Discard or Save and both options go away and Styles Revisions are moved up and become clickable.\n\nI am not certain that this is a good approach, but my goal is to keep things in one place. So one does not need to shift focus and eyes to another place on the screen.\n\nSeeing the revisions.\nI kinda like Ramons and James suggestions seen in both videos.\nThese are just different ways to present the same information.\nRamons: Avatar icon Revision by -user name-  and when the save was done along with the date and time.\nJames: Time in relation to last save and then an avatar.
