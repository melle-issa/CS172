Here\u2019s our agenda:\n12.0.0:\n#4954 BP Rewrites merge progress\n#8734 new community visibility feature\n\n11.2.0: decide about this minor release schedule\nIf you have specific/additional points you need to discuss about, please share them into the comments area of this post.\n\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\ud83e\udd1d\n#11-0-0, #12-0-0, #agenda, #dev-chat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nimath\n\n6:35 am on April 20, 2023 \n\n\n\nTags: 12.0.0 ( 14 ), dev chat ( 232 ), summary ( 68 ) \u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\nBP Dev-Chat summary: April 17,\u00a02023\n\n\nSee previously BP Dev Chat summary March 27 (2023)\nIn attendance:\u00a0@dcavins @im4th\nSlack archive.\n12.0.0 development cycle updates\nConsidering the remaining tasks to accomplish to end the BP Rewrites merge process, we\u2019ve decided to update the release schedule so that we have enough time to document the changes and help third party plugin authors to update their work to fully enjoy our new Rewrites API.\nUpdated schedule\n12.0.0-beta1 : July 30,\n12.0.0 : October 30.\n\nBP 12 is replacing the transmission in the car\n@dcavins \n#4954: we still have two major code tasks to work on: implementing parse_request() methods for Directory components and make our Ajax code use the WP Rewrite API. Once done we\u2019ll need to move our legacy URL parser into the BP Classic backcompat plugin. Then, we\u2019ll need to explain how this major change will modify the way to extend BuddyPress into our Developer documentation site. Here are the first questions we\u2019ll reply to:\nHow to fully enjoy the BP Rewrites API?\nHow a plugin can preserve backward compatibility with older versions of BuddyPress while enjoying this API?\n@dcavins will start exploring the Rewrites API, working on a new visibility feature to allow administrators make their community private.\nAbout #8457: we\u2019ll migrate to @wordpress/scripts (which uses Webpack) and we\u2019ll update every BP Blocks to support the version 2 of the WP Block API.\nBuddyPress will be represented at the Contributor day organized by the WP french community in Paris\nIf you do not have a chance to attend IRL to this contributor day, no worries: you can virtually join us to get involved into BuddyPress contribution going into our Slack channel on April 20, 2023 from 08:15 UTC to 15:30 UTC. It\u2019s today!!\nNext Dev-Chat\nIt will happen on May 1 at 21:00 UTC in #BuddyPress.

It got two 5 \u2b50\ufe0f reviews so far, one of them is saying it\u2019s a \u00ab game changer \u00bb. It\u2019s making @im4th very happy considering the hard work the team already invested into this add-on. @dcavins plans to use it on some of the sites he manages to get feedbacks from more users. Inside the plugin\u2019s support forum, requests were made about supporting the BP Legacy template pack & the Groups component.\n12.0.0 development cycle updates\nAbout #4954: @im4th accelerated on the BP Rewrites merge process as he realized there were more work than expected. Most of the BP URLs are now built using the BP Rewrites API, but quite an amount of functions needed to be deprecated/moved inside the BP Classic backcompat plugin. These deprecations will help us inform users they need to use this plugin to be sure to carry-on enjoying the third party plugin features that are not ready yet for the BP Rewrites API.\nAs the BP REST API & the BP Attachments Add-on will need to be improved to be ready for Rewrites, working on this will help us to advise third party plugin developers about the best way to stay compatible with pre 12.0 BP versions  as well as next BP versions.\nAbout #8457: @im4th decided to stop waiting for ParcelJS v2 to support global variables. The development team weirdly put this v1 feature out of v2 ones and there were no progress about bringing back this support for at least 2 years! The plan is to migrate to @wordpress/scripts which uses Webpack. You can follow our progress about it from this BP Blocks PR.\nAbout #7018: @im4th quickly added some #[AllowDynamicProperties] to be compatible with PHP 8.2, but he thinks a better fix would be to properly declare all properties to our Classes. @dcavins agrees.\n12.0.0 schedule\n12.0.0-beta1 : April 15,\n12.0.0 : May 31.\nNB: we\u2019ll need to update this initial schedule due to the BP Rewrites remaining work to achieve.\n2022 feedbacks & 2023 roadmap\n@im4th would really like to publish the wrap up post about the feedbacks we got last year. He thinks it\u2019s important to say: \u00ab hey we read you, and here\u2019s what we plan to do about it \u00bb. This post is waiting for review since February 27 and as it contains some suggestions about important changes he wishes we all agree about it or edit the parts we have different opinions on. @dcavins thinks this post is too long and suggests to split it as he\u2019s afraid that the exciting stuff at the end is after too much text (which people mostly don\u2019t read.).\nLet\u2019s try to decide about this during our next dev-chat.\nNext Dev-Chat\nIt will happen on April 17 at 21:00 UTC in #BuddyPress. If you have specific points or ideas you want to discuss about, don\u2019t hesitate to share them in comments.\n#12-0-0, #dev-chat, #summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nimath\n\n7:47 am on March 27, 2023 \n\n\n\nTags: Agenda ( 117 ), dev chat ( 232 ) \u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\nBP Dev-Chat Agenda March 27,\u00a02023\n\n\nHi!\nOur next development meeting will happen on March 27 at 21:00 UTC (today) in #BuddyPress.
