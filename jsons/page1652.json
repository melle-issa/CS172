That\u2019s one of the many relevant findings in the latest Chapman University Orange County Annual Survey, released in March during the University\u2019s Fifth Annual Public Policy Conference, this year titled \u201cThe Future of Transportation.\u201d\nIn the survey, 55 percent of respondents said they would not ride in a fully autonomous, self- driving car, and 45 percent objected to sharing the road with such vehicles. The survey also shows that, while Orange County remains car-centric, the door may be opening to mass transit, so long as it directly serves county residents.\n\n\n\n\u201cSeventy percent said that even if a more efficient public transportation system were available, they would still drive their cars to work,\u201d said Fred Smoller, Ph.D., associate professor of political science and co-director of the survey. \u201cOrange County people like their cars and use their cars every day.\u201d\nSupported by a grant from Fieldstead and Company and hosted by Wilkinson College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences, the Fifth Annual Public Policy Conference featured experts from the California High Speed Rail Authority, the Orange County Transportation Authority and the California Department of Transportation. Also joining in the conversation were public policy analysts, urban planners, journalists and engineers.\nTopics of discussion included traffic congestion, ride-sharing services, drones, scooters, the Hyperloop and high-speed rail.\nIn its second year, the Orange County Annual Survey takes the pulse of county residents on critical policy issues. This year\u2019s survey polled 704 county residents, with a focus on transit concerns.\n\n\n\nThe survey found that residents support mass transit, as long as new projects address local traffic issues. In addition, there\u2019s majority support for the OC Streetcar light rail line and a rail connection between Orange County and Los Angeles International Airport. But most respondents don\u2019t support California\u2019s $77 billion high-speed rail project, known as the bullet train.\nFor the second year in a row, the data suggest that Orange County is politically more moderate than its previous conservative reputation. Residents support gun control, environmental protection, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and a legal path to citizenship for those in the country without documentation.\n\u201cOrange County is changing and is much different today compared to the county of 20 or 30 years ago,\u201d said Mike Moodian, Ed.D., a Chapman integrated education studies faculty member and co-director of the survey. \u201cWe now see a county that is trending purple and is more balanced in terms of political views.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrange County survey \n\n\n\n\n \n\nDawn Bonker \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFighting Fires With Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging Math For Good\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumna Implements Sustainability at Happiest Place on Earth A Chapman University alumna is helping Disneyland Resort meet its ambitious goal of sending zero waste to landfills by 2030.
