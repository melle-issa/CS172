do I find purpose and meaning?\"\n\"What do I believe?\"\nThese are just some of the crucial questions you'll encounter on your journey of exploration. We at Fish are here to help guide and encourage you as you seek within to find the answers. Whether it is through a specific religious tradition, mindfulness, meditation, or simply spiritual exploration, we provide a safe, open, and inclusive space for you to seek purpose, value, and truth.\nOur chaplains of various faith traditions and academic expertise are the living representatives of Chapman's spiritual pillar. They not only conduct religious and spiritual services and provide educational programming, but also care for all members of the Chapman community. Though they accomplish this through a diverse array of beliefs, teachings, and values, all of our chaplains are united in their empathetic presence, their eagerness to listen, and their unconditional compassion.\nGet Social with us!Facebook\u00a0@FishInterfaithCenterInstagram\u00a0@FishInterfaithTwitter\u00a0@CU_Interfaith\n\n\u00a0\nOffice Hours:Monday-Friday, 8am-9pm\nSpring Break Hours:Monday-Friday, 8am-5pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish Interfaith Center\n\n\nAbout the Fish Interfaith Center\n\n\nSpiritual & Religious Student Groups\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nMindfulness & Spiritual Wellness\n\n\nMuslim Life\n\n\nJewish Life\n\n\nChristian Life\n\n\nInterfaith & Religious Resources \n\n\nReligious Accommodations at Chapman\n\n\nFish Interfaith Center Videos\n\n\nMeet Our Staff\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit Church Relations website\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman University's Fish Interfaith Center was recently mentioned in The President\u2019s Interfaith and Community Service Campus Challenge (PICSCC)!\nRead the report here \u00bb\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the Orange County Register's article on the Fish Interfaith Center \u00bb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport the Fish Interfaith Center\nFollow our Fish Blog\n\n\n\n\n\nBaccalaureate Service 2023\n\nJoin us for Baccalaureate on Thursday, May 18th, 2023 at 7pm in the Wallace All Faiths Chapel.\n\n\nDetails here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022 Baccalaureate Service Trailer!\nVisit our Baccalaureate page for more information!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Contact Us   Maps & Directions    Emergency \n\n\n\nOrange Campus\nOne University Drive  Orange, CA 92866   (714) 997-6815\n\nRinker Health Science Campus\n9401 Jeronimo Road  Irvine, CA 92618 \n\n\n\nGet Started\n\nVisit Chapman\nView Tuition and Aid\nApply Now\nEmployment\n\n\n\nDiscover\n\nSchools and Colleges\nPrograms at Chapman\nEvents at Chapman\nNewsroom\nDirectory\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\nReport Concern or Incident\nAccessibility Feedback\nWebsite Feedback\nDisability Services\nConsumer Disclosures\nPrivacy Policy\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n Chapman Logo                                               \n\u00a9 2022 Chapman University           \n\n\n Back to top    \n\n\n\n\n\n/_featured/Default.xml\nDefault\nDefault\nDo Not Show\nDo Not Show\n\n\n\n",
