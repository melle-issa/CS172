This access is what powers Jetpack Social, which in turn helps you automatically share your blog posts to Twitter. Though the service was restored that same day, it turns out that there were bigger changes looming on the horizon.\u00a0\nTwitter recently notified Automattic that it was dramatically changing the terms and pricing of the Twitter API. The cost increase is prohibitive for us to absorb without passing a significant price increase along to you, and we don\u2019t see that as an option. We have attempted to negotiate a path forward, but haven\u2019t been able to reach an agreement in time for Twitter\u2019s May 1 cutoff.\u00a0\nGiven that, we have decided to discontinue using the Twitter API.\nFor WordPress.com and Jetpack users, Twitter will no longer be part of Jetpack Social. However, we\u2019re adding Instagram and Mastodon very soon. In the meantime, auto-sharing to Tumblr, Facebook, and LinkedIn still works as expected, and you can continue sharing your blog post links on Twitter manually through their app or desktop site.\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this causes for your website and marketing efforts. We wish the outcome had been different, but our customers are always our primary concern, and we\u2019re not willing to compromise the experience or value you receive from WordPress.com and Jetpack.\u00a0If your recent experiences with Twitter have left you dissatisfied, go take Tumblr for a spin \u2014 we hear it\u2019s quite a party over there.\nEmail Newsletter\n\n\nMissing out on the latest WordPress.com developments?

Connections to Facebook Pages remain unchanged. Learn more.\u201d\n\nLikeLiked by 3 people\n\n\n\n \n\n  Carolyn S.\n\n\n\t\t\tMay 1st at 6:30 pm\n\nThat is correct. Facebook removed the ability to auto-share to personal profiles in 2018 when they removed that from their API, so we also had to remove it from auto-sharing. Sharing to Facebook Pages is unchanged and what the majority of people publish to. Manually sharing to a personal profile can still be done with no issues. I hope that clarifies things!\nLikeLiked by 4 people\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Carl D'Agostino\n\n\n\t\t\tApr 29th at 10:06 pm\n\nthanks for update\nLikeLiked by 4 people\n\n\n\n \n\n  Christopher T.

Pulling up your account, it looks like you\u2019re also publishing posts to Facebook and LinkedIn which would also fall under the paid plan you\u2019re using. We\u2019ll also be adding Mastadon and Instagram integrations around mid-June, so you\u2019ll have even more options to share your posts. \nIf you still have questions or concerns, please contact the Jetpack Support team for help.\nhttps://jetpack.com/contact-support/?rel=support\nThanks!\nLikeLiked by 3 people\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  Lee Roth\n\n\n\t\t\tApr 30th at 1:42 am\n\nNo worries.
