This conversational shift has helped to reduce the stigma that has been historically associated with mental illness. People are now more likely than ever to seek help for mental health issues and speak openly about their experiences with mental illness, resulting in increased awareness and understanding of mental health.\nBut for the Asian American community, mental health is not being embraced with open arms compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Michael Huynh, MPH, a doctoral student at UCI Public Health, is dedicating his research to unmasking hidden issues around mental health among Asian American subgroups.\u00a0\nIn his recent co-authored study published in the Public Health Reports, Huynh analyzed the prevalence of psychological distress and unmet mental health needs among Asian/Asian American adults during the COVID-19 pandemic across various sociodemographic subgroups.\u00a0\n\u201cAsian Americans may be experiencing mental health challenges for a variety of reasons, including family obligations, economic hardships, and racial discrimination,\u201d said Huynh. \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to anti-Asian hate crimes, which contributed to even greater stress, anxiety, and other mental health challenges within the community.\u201d\nThe researchers\u2019 findings showed that the odds of psychological distress were increased among adults who were female, trans, non-binary, aged 18-44 years, US-born, Cambodian, multiracial, and low income. Of those reporting psychological distress and unmet mental health needs, Korean, Japanese, and Cambodian were the highest. These differences among subgroups exemplify the various factors, such as diverse experiences and cultural backgrounds, that may be impacting mental health.\u00a0\n\n\nOver the years, the support I received from faculty, family, and friends is what motivated me to even want to pursue a doctoral degree and become a mental health researcher.\u201d\n\u2013 Michael Huynh, MPH\n\u201cOne potential explanation that could be contributing to unmet mental health care is that services like therapy and support groups are either too costly to afford, too inaccessible for scheduling, or too daunting to search for those that can provide comfortable discussions on shared Asian American identity,\u201d added Huynh, who is concentrating his degree on disease prevention. \u201cThis can exacerbate mental health problems and lead to a sense of isolation, disconnection, and hopelessness.\u201d\nAnother factor is the concept of the \u201cmodel minority stereotype,\u201d which portrays Asian Americans as successful, hardworking, and high-achieving individuals. While this stereotype can be positive in some ways, it can also create pressure for Asian Americans to excel academically and professionally, leading to stress, anxiety, and burnout. It also masks unique challenges that subgroups within the Asian American monolith face. For example, some Southeast Asian American communities may experience higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the legacy of war and violence in their home countries, as well as resettlement challenges in the United States.\nPictured here is Michael Huynh and family\u00a0\nAs a Vietnamese American who grew up in Little Saigon, Orange County, Michael learned how factors like refugee history, pressures to attain financial stability, and limited knowledge of mental health services affected his community. Michael is bringing those lived experiences to his research to address these factors and ultimately promote mental wellness within the Asian American community.\u00a0\n\u201cOver the years, the support I received from faculty, family, and friends is what motivated me to even want to pursue a doctoral degree and become a mental health researcher,\u201d says Michael. \u201cMy current dissertation proposal is titled \u2018Friend Support and Its Implications on the Mental Health of Asian American Adolescents\u2019 with the hopes of informing directions for the future development of interventions for Asian American populations.\u201d\n\n\t\t\t\tCategory: Alumni, Students Topic: Mental Health, Race/Ethnicity \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCI Health Sciences Complex\n856 Health Sciences Quad\nUniversity of California, Irvine\nIrvine, CA 92697-3957\nContact Our Offices & Staff\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n                        TELephone:                    \n949-824-2358\n\n\nFax: \n949-824-2039\n\n\n\n\nRelated sites\nUCI Susan & Henry Samueli College of Health Sciences\nUCI Health Affairs\nUCI Homepage\nUCI Brilliant Future Campaign\nUCI Directory\nUCI COVID-19 Chatline\nUCI Forward\nCOVID-19 Contact Tracing\n \n\n\nStay Connected\n\nGet news, stories & events from UCI Public Health.\n\n                        Subscribe to Our Monthly Newsletter                        \n\n\n\n\nFollow us on social\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 2023.
