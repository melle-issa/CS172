As part of this effort, the new SQLite database integration is now available for testing as a standalone plugin.\nYoast-sponsored contributor Ari Stathopoulos, who is leading the initiative to develop the SQLite implementation, requests that hosting companies, plugin developers, and theme authors test the plugin. Contributors are aiming to put it on track to become a canonical plugin and eventually merge the SQLite implementation into WordPress\u00a0Core\u00a0in a future release.\nStathopoulos updated the call for testing with instructions for how to test the standalone plugin. This is not something that should be tested in production. After activating the plugin, users can just follow the instructions on the screen to install the SQLite database.\n\nWhen testing I found that I had to delete the wp-content/db.php file in order to get the plugin to install, because it displayed the following error:\n\nThe SQLite plugin cannot be activated because a different\u00a0wp-content/db.php\u00a0drop-in already exists. \n\nAfter clicking the Install button, the plugin takes you to the familiar WordPress install screen where you select the language and enter the site name and password. \nIn the testing instructions, Stathopoulos noted that the plugin will create a fresh database and no content will be migrated from the original database. The old database will remain and if the plugin is deactivated the site will go back to using MySQL. Stathopoulos explained why  users will not see content from their old database when the new one is active:\n\nThe SQLite implementation does not include a way to migrate data from one database to another. Since this is a proposal for an implementation to be merged in WordPress Core, we need to follow the WordPress Core principles. Data\u00a0migration\u00a0is not something that Core should do; it is clearly plugin territory. Your data remains safely in your previous database, and you can access it again by disabling the SQLite module.\nWhen SQLite gets merged in Core, migration and backup plugins will add support for it.\n\nThe repository for the SQLite Database Integration plugin has been moved to the WordPress organization on GitHub and testers can offer feedback there. \nResults of the vote on the best approach to unbundling the Performance Lab plugin indicate that contributors are more in favor of keeping the Performance Lab plugin as is, but additionally deploying modules as individual plugins (32 votes) versus the alternative of making PL a wrapper focused on central infrastructure and recommendation of individual plugins (10 votes). \nIt\u2019s possible the SQLite Integration Plugin may accessed as an independent module or recommended through the Performance Lab plugin in some way in the future, but it\u2019s not yet been decided. Once a path forward is formalized, it will be more clear how the Performance Lab\u2019s new structure will affect the standalone SQLite integration plugin. \nCategory: NewsShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Like thisLike Loading\u2026\n\n6\n\n\n\n\t\t6 responses to \u201cSQLite Database Integration Now Available as a Plugin for  Testing\u201d\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Kristina Ponting says: \n\nJanuary 26, 2023 at 12:39 AM \n\n\nNO! please no!

However, some sites, under some circumstances, might benefit from a lighter database \u2013 like SQLite.\nIf it\u2019s not for you and you prefer your current database, then that\u2019s fine.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n J.

Is it time to build a legacy wrapper around wpdb, so that people can use hooks to add in different implementations and not fiddle with the filesystem too much.\nAlso, as myself and sqlite have different features. is it worth considering that this might break a lot of other community plugins?\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Lewis Cowles says: \n\nJanuary 27, 2023 at 9:03 AM \n\n\nThis is great, although there was an existing plugin to do this.\nIs it time to build a legacy wrapper around wpdb, so that people can use hooks to add in different implementations?
