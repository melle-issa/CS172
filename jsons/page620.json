You said we could carve a hole in it; \nstring it like a jewel around my neck. If I wanted. But I wanted instead to shoot. \nSo you brought me the smallest rifle of your dad\u2019s dozen from inside,\nwhere Rainer and Zola jingled behind you curious. And two aluminum cans\nwe set on flowerpots at the foot of the shallow ditch. I watched you feed\n.22 cartridges into the magazine, explaining\u2014open action, safety on, aimed \naway. Before you reversed the orders and shot the first can dead-on. \nI lifted my dress, set a knee to gravel, scoped over the garden cart \nthe metal heart, and shot. Ping, thrill. \u2014That was that. Back inside, Rainer  \npursued, sniffing the empty barrel as you moved to lock it up. I remembered \nyou\u2019d once said, watching him lick my face, how you\u2019d realized just how big \nhe was. His teeth and broad neck, capable of shaking animals to death. \nWe put the planters back in the shed. We let the dogs back out into the yard. \nYou pointed out flocks of geese, snow geese, and sandhill cranes migrating \nover the alfalfa field. More than beautiful. Said, No one can hunt them. At least \nnot here. Pointed out their shadows. Like smoke descending onto the trees.\n\n\nBy Gabriela Valencia\nView All Poetry\n\nNonfiction\n\nI have known since my father\u2019s death 10 years ago that grief doesn\u2019t tiptoe in stages. It seeps in slowly and swells and swells and propels you into the arms of solace in unimaginable ways. Mine led to the banks of the Ganges. I believe I was summoned\u2014pulled an inch each day. The urgency caught me by surprise. It\u2019s not as though I hadn\u2019t clutched my husband\u2019s collar and left damp blotches on the white. It\u2019s not as though I hadn\u2019t sat under the grandfather banyan in the hospital\u2019s parking lot and howled like a wolf in labor with my father\u2019s medical report clenched in my hands. But the well never ran dry. \n\nFrom \"The Ritual of Grief\" by Vimla Sriram\nView All Nonfiction\n\nFiction\n\nWho can say exactly how it happened? Ask any of the other students, or ask the bespectacled teacher at the front of the room, and they\u2019ll tell you that it was an immediate transformation. One moment, the quarterback was there, grasping his teammate\u2019s hand. The next moment, he had been seemingly replaced by a little cardinal, its scarlet feathers flashing as it swooped through the air. It chirped, and its falling aria sounded very much like a repeated human word: You, you, you.\n\n\nFrom \"Fable Containing the Warmth of a Hand\" by Kimberly Ramos\nView All Fiction\n\nArt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All Art\n\n\nCover art: \"Mama Horse\" by Jessica Sid\n\n\n\n\n\n CSU, Chico English Department\n400 West First Street, Chico, CA 95929\n530-898-5124\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Fall 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nIn This Issue\n\nIn This Issue\nPoetry\nNonfiction\nFiction\nArt\n\n\nSubmit\nAbout\n\nAbout Watershed\nEditorial Staff\n\n\nArchives\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
