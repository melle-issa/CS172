Apply to the Chico State College of AgricultureIf it were just food and fiber, it would be indispensable. But agriculture is more than that. It\u2019s both the promise of sustenance for a hungry world and a source of enjoyment in a demanding world. It is education and entertainment. It is land use and landscape. It is natural sustainability and national security.It is a confluence of biology, chemistry, physics, genetics, engineering, meteorology, biotechnology, economics, finance, marketing, packaging, distribution, sales, and sociology. Essentially, agriculture is life.For almost 70 years, the College of Agriculture at California State University, Chico has impacted the quality of life in California and across the nation by educating and equipping agricultural leaders who have the theoretical knowledge, practical experience, and decision-making ability that allows them to excel in their chosen career. The close, friendly nature of our college, combined with an integrated agricultural curriculum and remarkable access to hands-on education, creates a fertile learning environment for our students and the agriculture industry we serve.\n\t\t\t\tStudent Spotlight\n\t\t\tCurrent EntriesMatthew ChionoMatthew Chiono, a senior majoring in agricultural education, grew up in Marysville where hedeveloped a passion for machinery and welding and a love for mechanics.
