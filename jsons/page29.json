We are working hard to ensure all students truly feel they belong on our campus so they can tackle our world\u2019s biggest problems in a global economy. At the same time, we're creating an environment where our staff and faculty can thrive on their way to professional success.\nWe continue to value our diversity of complex and intersecting identities, and strive to maintain an environment that is socially just, equitable, respectful and inclusive. Cal Poly\u2019s classrooms and work environments are places of respectful engagement and informed debate that maintain human dignity. We acknowledge that differing perspectives, which arise from our own individual and group experiences and our social positioning, are central to the development of thoughtful and critical thinkers, scholars and change agents.\nAs a public university, Cal Poly seeks to mirror the diversity and demographics of California by supporting everyone\u2019s potential to thrive in our learning community, especially historically underrepresented and marginalized individuals. We are focusing our key initiatives in three areas: recruiting and retaining diverse students, staff and faculty; enriching curriculum and other learning experiences; and improving campus climate for all. Read the university's statement on diversity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Land on Which We Learn\nWe gratefully acknowledge, respect\u00a0and thank the yak tit\u02b8u tit\u02b8u yak ti\u0142hini, Northern Chumash Tribe of San Luis Obispo County and Region in whose homelands we are guests.\nAs a public institution, Cal Poly has the responsibility to acknowledge their presence and educate the community as a whole about its history.\nThese places and villages have, and always will be, sites of relationship and exchange. Naming the university\u2019s newest residence halls yak\u0294it\u02b8ut\u02b8u after the original Northern Chumash villages is a first step toward recognizing this responsibility and developing partnerships across communities of students, faculty, staff\u00a0and neighbors on the Cal Poly campus and beyond. Learn more about the partnership. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Involved\nInclusion begins with each one of us in the Cal Poly community stepping up to become more informed and connect with one another.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about CPX inclusive action planning\nInvest time in diversity and inclusion training\nParticipate in Cal Poly\u2019s annual Teach In\nFind a student club, religious or cultural organization\nJoin our faculty/staff associations\nExplore living/learning communities in University Housing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Initiatives\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCPX: Campus Climate Survey and Action Planning\n\nIn 2019, the university partnered with Dr. Damon Williams to launch the Cal Poly Experience (CPX) initiative to gather concrete data on campus climate and use it as a foundation for action plans to help Cal Poly realize a more diverse, inclusive and equitable future.\nExplore the CPX survey reports, and get involved in shaping personal and institutional strategies that will help move our university forward.\nexplore CPX\n\n\n\n \n\nCal Poly Scholars\n\nThe Cal Poly Scholars program supports students in all six academic colleges by providing graduates from California partner high schools with scholarships for up to five years, laptops, proactive advising and a supportive living/learning community with their peers and mentors.\nThe program has improved retention rates among first-generation and low-income students, and its scope will grow to support thousands more students in the coming years.\nget to know Cal Poly scholars\n\n\n\n \n\nFaculty Cluster Hiring\n\nSixteen new assistant professors joined Cal Poly in fall 2019 as part of the first university-wide cluster hire effort. These tenure-track educators have proven expertise in a specific facet of their discipline that fuels diversity and inclusion.\nNow at work in five of Cal Poly\u2019s academic colleges, each professor guides our students through inclusive teaching strategies and conducts much-needed research in their discipline, strengthening our learning community from within.\nLearn more about Faculty Cluster Hiring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Stories\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Common Bond\nEngineers Jake Javier and Leila Murray found friendship through a shared passion for helping people like them living with spinal cord afflictions.\nRead Jake's and Leila's story\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Questions\nPsychology Professor Jay Bettergarcia aims to transform mental health resources for LGBTQ+ folks locally and throughout California.\nRead Jay's story\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Day in the Life of Interns\nFollow along as members of the National Society of Black Engineers tackle exciting summer internships in health care, government and technology. \nFollow along a day in the life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReach out to the right office\nThese offices can help you find more specific support programs, trainings, scholarships and details on Cal Poly\u2019s diversity and inclusion initiatives.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOffice of University Diversity and Inclusion\n\nEmail: [email\u00a0protected]Phone: 805-756-2250Office: Building 01, Room 209\nOUDI website\n\n\n\n \n\nstudent diversity and belonging\nEmail: [email\u00a0protected]Phone: 805-756-6000Office: Building 65 (University Union), Room 217\nstudent diversity and belonging\u00a0website\n\n\n\n \n\nDean of Students\nEmail: [email\u00a0protected]Phone: 805-756-0327Office: Building 81\nDean of Students website\n\n\n\n \n\nBlack academic excellence Center\nEmail: [email\u00a0protected] Phone: 805-756-6774Office: Building 52, Room E23\nBAEC website\n\n\n\n \n\nOffice of Equal Opportunity\nEmail: [email\u00a0protected]Phone: 805-756-6770Office: Building 33 (Fisher Science), Room 290\nOEO website\n\n\n\n \n\nCenter for Teaching, Learning and Technology\nEmail: [email\u00a0protected]Phone: 805-756-7002Office: Building 35 (Kennedy Library), Room 319\nCTLT website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\nLearn\n\n\nAcademic Calendar\nGraduate Programs\nUndergraduate\nApply to Cal Poly\n\n\n\n\nExplore\n\n\nCampus Map\nCatalog\nKennedy Library\nTake a Tour\n\n\n\n\nExperience\n\n\nCal Poly Magazine\nCareers at Cal Poly\nEvents\nGive to Cal Poly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday\n\n\nCal Poly CampusClouds59\u2109\nCal Poly PierTides2:13 PMLow8:43 PMHigh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Grand Avenue,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSan Luis Obispo, CA 93407\n\n805-756-1111\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Footer Primary\n\n\nUniversity Home\n\n\nMy Cal Poly Portal\n\n\nCampus Map\n\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\n\nHealth and Wellbeing\n\n\nCampus Safety\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Footer Secondary\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\nWeb Accessibility Statement\n\n\nTitle IX\n\n\nCampus Annual Security Report (PDF)\n\n\nCampus Safety Plan (PDF)\n\n\nPDF Reader\n\n\nCOVID-19 Information\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Learn by DoingSM has been Cal Poly\u2019s pedagogy since 1901\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCalifornia Polytechnic State University\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
