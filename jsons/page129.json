Degrading slurs, written on the whiteboard outside a student residence, brought much-needed attention to SSU\u2019s campus climate, and mobilized a group of students who wanted to make a significant change in the campus culture. Campus leadership commissioned the Seawolf Values Committee in November 2014, which was comprised of students, faculty, and staff to identify values that would characterize the Seawolf\u00a0identity. After a yearlong process the\u00a0values of Integrity, Excellence, Respect, and Responsibility were selected as\u00a0the founding principles\u00a0of the Seawolf Commitment.\nAs a Seawolf, I Commit Myself to the Highest Ethical Standards.Integrity - I will conduct myself with INTEGRITY in my dealings with students, staff, and faculty\n\u00a0Excellence - I will strive for EXCELLENCE in my academic work and relationshipsRespect - I will RESPECT the rights and dignity of othersResponsibility - I have the RESPONSIBILITY to conduct myself as an ethical member of my community\nIntegration into University Life\u00a0\nThe Seawolf Commitment has\u00a0been embraced across the campus as a guide for our collective behavior and are among the university\u2019s core values as reflected in our\u00a0strategic plan. Initially, Student Involvement, Residential Education and Campus Housing, Office of\u00a0Student Conduct, and Orientation each adopted and integrated the Seawolf Commitment values in active and passive programming, as well as to frame educational conversations about bias and social justice. Associated Students\u00a0and Academic Senate\u00a0then passed resolutions endorsing the Seawolf Commitment. Additionally, President Sakaki and the 2017 Associated Students President, Wilson Hall, recorded a\u00a0video\u00a0affirming their\u00a0support of the Seawolf Commitment.
