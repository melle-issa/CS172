From parents and grandparents to aunts, cousins, and siblings, the University has played a consistent role in the lives of hundreds of families with generations of Wildcats in their lineage.\nJeff Logsdon (Civil Engineering, \u201912) knows firsthand how strong the affinity can be to one\u2019s alma mater, particularly when you share that experience with family. He, his younger brother, and his uncle are alumni.\nToday, as the associate director of Admissions at Chico State, Logsdon also witnesses the impact of this tradition with prospective students on a near-daily basis. During campus tours, the connection for alumni visiting with their children or grandchildren is unmistakable, he said.\n\u201cI see the admiration in their eyes and hear the giddiness in the voices\u2014particularly the dads,\u201d he said.\nFamily members want to tell the potential Wildcat all about their favorite spots on campus, the buildings that housed their classes, and study sessions in the library, Logsdon said. For students who follow in a loved one\u2019s footsteps, it often provides a sense of belonging and community before their first day of class. This shared experience connects the past, present, and future for these families.\nOf course, Logsdon said, having multiple family members earn one or more degrees from Chico State also serves as proof of the academic quality and lasting power of the University.\n\u201cAlumni have found success in their careers, and that is why families trust us and are comfortable enough to send their children here,\u201d he said. \u201cIs there higher praise than that?\u201d\nThe following stories are about families rooted in the University. You\u2019ll read about how a father\u2019s encouragement led to his 10 children earning degrees; an athletic team with a long roster of siblings; a love story that took root in college; a mother and son who followed their passion together; identical twins who supported one another\u2019s growth and found ways to thrive as unique individuals; and five siblings fulfilling their father\u2019s dream. For these families\u2014and more than 177,000 alumni\u2014Chico State is not just a university or campus. It is the branches of the family tree.\nThe most common path for a student arriving at Chico State is directly from high school or transferring from a community college\u2014rare is the student with years between high school or stints on a college campus. Yet, each semester, dozens of students enroll with such a story.\nRead about some of our Wildcat families:\n\n\nMother, Son Turned Classmates Learn from Each Other\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nFive Siblings Follow Father\u2019s Dream\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nPitch-Perfect Wildcats\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nCrossed Paths Lead Back to Chico\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nDegrees of Hope and Opportunity\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nIdentical Twins Follow Different Dreams\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWe encourage alumni and Wildcats on campus to share their Chico State family tree story!
