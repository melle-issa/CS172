Sometimes you find your voice. Bella Gerencser \u201924 and Emilie Haskell \u201924 came to Chapman University and did both.\nThey met on a text chain a few months before they got to Chapman, and then the bond became unbreakable when, coincidentally, or perhaps karmically, they ended up living on the same floor of The K residence hall.\nAs they went the extra mile to meet new classmates during the pandemic, and as they navigated a new world they perceived to be full of smarter and cooler people than they are, Gerencser and Haskell found it comforting to have someone two doors down who just gets it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust Two Indie Girls Navigating\n\n\n\n\n\nA Male Manipulator World\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust Two Indie Girls Navigating a Male Manipulator World\n\n\n\n\n\nSteadily, they found their communities, including Chapman Radio, where they started producing and co-hosting their own show about a week after they met in person. Now, two years later, their creation has been honored as the best college talk show in the nation.\nIn many ways, the experience of Gerencser and Haskell exemplifies what has been in the ether and on the air since Chapman Radio first launched more than half a century ago. Give smart, inquisitive students the tools, training and air time, then sit back and listen as they gain their bearings behind the microphone and beyond.\n\u201cI like being 100% open and vulnerable \u2013 I like being 100% me \u2013 and Bella\u2019s the same way,\u201d says Haskell, a junior double majoring in political science and documentary and broadcast journalism. \u201cSo we love having Chapman Radio as an outlet, and we\u2019ve found that we have really good radio chemistry.\n\n\n\n\n\u2018You\u2019re Not Like Other Girls\u2019\n\n\n\n\nThat chemistry is evident as, at 9 p.m. on a spring Wednesday, Gerencser and Haskell slip on their headphones and slide behind their mics in Chapman Radio\u2019s Henley Hall basement studio. They seamlessly transition from off-air small talk to riffing on their topic of the day: music they\u2019re embarrassed to admit they like. They laugh often as they share stories full of candor \u2013 \u201cjust two indie girls navigating a male manipulator world,\u201d as they say in the description of their show \u201cYou\u2019re Not Like Other Girls.\n\u201cThe more you get to know them, the more it\u2019s clear that they just are not going to tap dance around issues,\u201d says Travis Bartosh, the Chapman radio faculty advisor. \u201cIt\u2019s just not in their nature to hold back. From a podcast and radio standpoint, that\u2019s what we want from hosts. We don\u2019t want them to be filtered, whether we agree with them or not. That\u2019s why we listen.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not in their nature to hold back. From a podcast and radio standpoint, that\u2019s what we want from hosts\u2026 that\u2019s why we listen.\u201d\n\u2013 Travis Bartosh, Ph.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGerencser and Haskell are far from alone in their commitment to the freeform and collaborative ethos of Chapman Radio, which often is ranked among the top 20 college radio stations nationally by the Princeton Review.\nOn any given day, the greater Henley Hall basement studio space pulses with activity as students not only produce and host their shows but also provide support for other members of the Chapman Radio community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop by and you might meet Reese Velez \u201925 (DJ Reese), who\u2019s been performing almost all her life and provides voice coaching for kids. With her show \u201cAsian Fusion,\u201d she amplifies the music and voices of AAPI artists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there\u2019s Ellis Pearson \u201922, lead housing assistant at Chapman and contributor to the show \u201cLive From the Henley Hall Basement,\u201d which started this summer as a mix of music, talk and news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd don\u2019t miss a chance to get to know Natasha Young \u201825, creator of the show \u201cThe Fisheye Forecast,\u201d which draws inspiration from live radio theatre of the 1930s, with powerful threads of surreal scifi psychological horror comedy and elements of Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales woven in for good fun.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Producers Earn the License to Explore\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re also likely to bump into Bartosh. While students create the programming and staff the station, he provides the mentorship as program advisor in the Chapman School of Communication. The school offers classes, workshops and other training for students interested in joining the Chapman Radio community.\n\u201cStudents take the class one semester so they get trained and get comfortable in the studio,\u201d Bartosh says. \u201cThey have to earn what\u2019s called their broadcast license, and once they do, they roll over into being a Chapman Radio club member and they have access to do their show each semester if they want.\nBartosh is a great ambassador for Chapman Radio. He\u2019s eager to show visitors and new student talent the $30,000 industry-quality sound board in the studio \u2013 a space he gutted and rebuilt during the down time of the pandemic, with advice and hands-on help from Mike Boyle, a producer of Angels baseball broadcasts on AM 830 KLAA.\nThe space mirrors professional studios, \u201cand our ability to livestream also is incredible,\u201d Bartosh says. \u201cWe built this from scratch \u2013 we don\u2019t use any third-party resources, which a lot of college stations do.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA $30,000 sound board helps students prepare to succeed in the radio and podcast industries.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe built this [studio] from scratch \u2013 we don\u2019t use any third-party resources, which a lot of college stations do.\u201d\n\u2013 Travis Bartosh, Ph.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Radio faculty advisor Travis Bartosh, Ph.D., at left in the photo above, is a great ambassador and historian for the program.\n\n\n\n\n\nBartosh also makes sure that students know the historical foundation on which the current program is built.\nChapman Radio began in 1967, when students founded an over-the-air station (KNAB AM 890) in a control room that they created by converting a coat closet. From the beginning, \u201cthe leadership was the students,\u201d one of the co-founders, Rick Eisleben \u201969, recalled in 2015.\nThat student creative control over programming has endured as the station has converted from over\u2013the-air to live streaming, at chapmanradio.live.\nEisleben is among the alumni who have built careers out of their Chapman Radio experience. Instead of becoming a minister, as he had planned, Eisleben created his own film and TV production company, working largely with faith leaders and their communities.\nOther graduates of the program include Ken Bunt \u201993, now president of Disney Music Group; Jeff Levering \u201905, TV and radio broadcaster for the Milwaukee Brewers; Cameron Louis \u201913, executive producer for iHeartMedia and TV producer of \u201cThe Woody Show\u201d; and Caroline Brown \u201921, a board operator at iHeartMedia.\nOften those alumni return to speak with students about careers in media and music. Brown says that by the time she graduated, she was convinced of the rewards.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Radio \u2018Changed my Life Path\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI love talking with people, and I love the connection radio provides,\u201d she says. \u201cGetting to hang out with these great people all the time and share my passion for music made the Chapman Radio experience stand out. It changed my life path.\nFor Gerencser and Haskell, the benefits of their experience include the technical and practical \u2013 they know how to run a soundboard, upload episodes of their weekly show to podcasting websites and promote their show via social media.\nThe experience also gives them a leg up within their disciplines. As a screenwriter, Gerencser listens to past shows with an ear for authentic dialogue. \u201cIt\u2019s useful that for an hour Emilie and I are constantly going back and forth,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cGetting to hang out with these great people all the time and share my passion for music made the chapman radio experience stand out. It changed my life path.\u201d\n\u2013 Caroline Brown \u201921\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cwait,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid we just hear that right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWait, did we just hear that right?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, it\u2019s the interpersonal rewards that make their show a passion project.\nI\u2019ve had people tell me, \u2018It\u2019s nice listening to you guys because it feels like I\u2019m talking with siblings or best friends back home,\u2019\u201d Gerencser says. \u201cThat\u2019s something I really value \u2013 I\u2019m very happy about that.\u201d\nOf course, it was also a nice perk when the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System recognizes your work as the Best Talk Program in the nation.\nThe awards are usually handed out in New York, but since the pandemic hit, the ceremony has been held online. There were some connectivity issues this year, so when the award announcement was made, it was a \u201cwait, did we just hear that right?\u201d kind of a moment for Gerencser and Haskell. They celebrated with some ramen.\nBut that\u2019s OK, they say, because in the end it\u2019s about the show, their friendship and the community.\n\u201cI make the joke about awards that they ensure Bella has a reason to hang out with me once a week,\u201d Haskell says with a smile. \u201cWe went from being neighbors, to working on this show, to moving in together. It\u2019s really lovely to have that chart of a relationship.\u201d\nAnd the show? What does the national award say about \u201cYou\u2019re Not Like Other Girls\u201d?\n\u201cA lot of people just really want to feel at home,\u201d Haskell says. \u201cThat\u2019s something Bella and I are really good at. Not only in radio, but in our everyday lives.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of people just really want to feel at home. That\u2019s something Bella and I are really good at.
