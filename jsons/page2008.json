You can find help with your WordPress problem by posting in the support forums or asking on the #wordpress IRC channel.\n\n\nWant to get involved?\nAnswering a question in the support forums or on IRC is one of the easiest ways to get started. Everyone knows the answer to something!\nWe have a detailed handbook to help contributors learn how to work with the forums and IRC.\n\n\nWeekly Meetings\nAs well as discussing support issues here on the blog, we use Slack for group communication.\nOur weekly meeting is held every Thursday 17:00 UTC, with the first meeting of the month being office hours, and the next will be at Thursday, 17:00 UTC (your time zone) in #forums on SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform https://slack.com/. The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at https://make.wordpress.org/chat/..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMarius L.

For us, this is the team that works on internal WordPress sites like WordCamp Central and Make WordPress. team posted asking if the various teams would like to have a stats dashboard.One of the requirements for such a dashboard would of course be to actually collect analytics.\nThe support team does not currently collect anything explicitly, there are some numbers readily available from the bbPressbbPress Free, open source software built on top of WordPress for easily creating forums on sites. https://bbpress.org. dashboard widgetWidget A WordPress Widget is a small block that performs a specific function. You can add these widgets in sidebars also known as widget-ready areas on your web page. WordPress widgets were originally created to provide a simple and easy-to-use way of giving design and structure control of the WordPress theme to the user. (such as topics created, replies created), but these do not give a good insight without associative information such as dates or times.\nDuring a recent team meeting, the prospect of including some statistics with our weekly updates was brought up, which would be the baseline for any  such dashboard.\nBy introducing some numbers in our updates, we can improve transparency around the teams interactions, and also start to make the call on what information would be good to have in an analytics dashboard.\nSome of the ideas that were shared to get the ball rolling were:\nAmount of posts comparison between themes, plugins, and general global forums in the given time frame\nAmount of users blocked in the given time frame\nAmount of reported topics handled in the given time frame\nAmount of resolved thread within the given time frame\nWhat information would be good to have, and in what way should it be presented to give the most value, both to the team, but also to anyone looking in and wanting to learn more?Share this:TwitterFacebookLogin to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njordesign\n\n5:06 pm on April 20, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nI think this could prove really valuable in helping to assess the workload and volume of both the support team, and Mods specifically as well.\nWith that in mind it could also be interesting to report on:\n\nThe number of modwatched posts that have been reviewed and approved, and also reviewed and not approved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntobifjellner (Tor-Bjorn Fjellner)\n\n5:22 pm on April 20, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nI like that. It could be interesting to harvest data from the Rosetta forums, too. And it would be useful to indicate the number of pending/spammed posts per locale: this way we would quickly notice if any forum is slowly drifting away unattended.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment. \nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
