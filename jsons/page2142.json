This is where you can download the source code for WordPress core, plugins and themes as well as the central location for community conversations and organization.  https://wordpress.org/ has to be GPLGPL GPL is an acronym for GNU Public License. It is the standard license WordPress uses for Open Source licensing https://wordpress.org/about/license/. The GPL is a \u2018copyleft\u2019 license https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html. This means that derivative work can only be distributed under the same license terms. This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD license and the MIT License are widely used examples. Compatible. This is not in doubt. More and more people are using tools to build code for them, based on bare-bones input. With the advent of ChatGPT, this has become more popular.\nTo be clear here: There is no guideline AGAINST using generated code.\nYou\u2019re welcome to use whatever tool you want to build plugins. That said, you are 100% responsible for that code if you chose to host it here. This is not a change to any guideline, merely a reminder that if you claim it\u2019s your code, you are responsible for it.\nBut the important bit here is that if means if ChatGPT, for example, built your plugin, you have to verify that all the code used is GPL compatible. Just like you are expected to validate licenses on libraries and code-snippets, everything in your plugin has to be GPL compatible. Should we determine that your code is a copy of someone else\u2019s or includes code from non-GPL plugins, your submission will be rejected and any live plugins will be closed. \nSadly this has already become a small issue, as people asked an AI to build a \u2018scroll to top\u2019 plugin and it literally copied code from another, existing, plugin hosted on WordPress.org. Actually five times. And they were all rejected since it was pretty obvious.\nNow before someone asks, yes it\u2019s fine to fork code. You have to credit them, however, and that\u2019s something those AIs have been pretty bad at doing. Also remember that the AI can tell you how to submit a plugin and be wrong. And by wrong I mean totally, 100%, that was really some bad advice someone got wrong. Make sure you double check. Robots won\u2019t take our jobs yet.\nIf you submit code, it\u2019s your responsibility. Nothing\u2019s changed.\n#guidelines, #reminderShare this:TwitterFacebookLogin to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArnan de Gans\n\n11:27 pm on March 21, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nMaybe there should be a thing against a bot writing code\u2026\nCode reviews are different of-course.

Snippets etc as well. There is no objective measure of how much autocomplete or snippet usage would cross the line to being \u2018bot written\u2019. So it\u2019s not that black and white.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIpstenu (Mika Epstein)\n\n11:57 pm on March 21, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nA tool is a tool. If you use an AI to generate a framework, is that somehow fundamentally different from a setup like \u2026 https://underscores.me where you can have the main theme setup for you?\nYou\u2019re assuming people use the AI to write the whole pluginPlugin A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website.

We see people use an AI to get things started. Heck, I wouldn\u2019t mind asking chatGPT to make my settings pages, I hate that tediousness \ud83d\ude00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodeBard\n\n11:27 pm on March 21, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nYep. The legal situation regarding copyright with respect to AI-generated code is extremely complicated. And I don\u2019t think there is any legit-looking solution proposed by anyone yet\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOllieJones\n\n5:31 pm on March 23, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nThanks for this reminder, Mika. As a longtime GPLGPL GPL is an acronym for GNU Public License. It is the standard license WordPress uses for Open Source licensing https://wordpress.org/about/license/.

This is in distinction to permissive free software licenses, of which the BSD license and the MIT License are widely used examples. code writer, I\u2019m really bugged that the various AI setups are taking GPL code, a tiny bit of it mine, grinding it up, anonymizing it, and  basically stealing it out from under the GPL licenses. This annoys me. I thought I was contributing to the public good. \nThese natural language models are, as you say, entirely incapable of explaining how their got their answers or crediting their sources.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment. \n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\u2190 Advance Notice of Retirement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\nEmail Updates\n\n\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail Address\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJoin 2,587 other subscribers\t\t\t\t\n\nHelp TopicsPlugin Guidelines\nDeveloper FAQ\nUsing Subversion\nUsing Plugin Assets\nHow Your Readme.txt works\nRecent UpdatesRecent CommentsNo RepliesRecent UpdatesRecent CommentsNo RepliesRecent Activity\n\n\n\t\t\tTeam Pledges\n\t\t\n\n0 people have pledged time to contribute to Plugins Team efforts!
