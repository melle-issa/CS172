The award reflects many new and upcoming zero waste initiatives. \n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\nBy Emily Moskal\n\n\nThe pleasant and attractive chute room in EVGR is meant to encourage residents to spend more time there, properly sorting their waste.

The competition is in partnership with the National Wildlife Federation, one of the largest nonprofits in the U.S. dedicated to conservation.\nStanford received top honors for properly disposing of the most recyclables by weight for an eight-week stretch earlier this year among participating large universities.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the process of improving the design of our entire waste stream, from how it\u2019s generated at the procurement side, all the way down to the waste hauling and how it\u2019s processed behind the scenes,\u201d said Aurora Winslade, director of the Office of Sustainability at Stanford.\nThe living laboratory of waste reduction\nStanford has one of the oldest and largest recycling programs in the country. Julie Muir, the zero waste systems manager at Stanford, uses the Campus Race to Zero Waste \u2013 which the university has participated in for over 15 years \u2013 as a benchmark.\nMuir expects to perform even better next year after she implements new zero waste initiatives, which started this June. Her group is setting up single-stream recycling, adding composting to every break room, composting bathroom paper towels, and adding common area recycling rather than desk-side collection, among other initiatives.\nBoth in the past and moving forward, the University also supports processes through which food scraps are fed to farm animals and other organics are repurposed \u2013 like sending cooking oil to be made into biofuels \u2013 said Muir, who added that campuses get additional points in the competition for these waste reduction methods.\nOne of the major changes in zero waste initiatives is centralizing recycling, which will require everyone to participate in the success of the waste system. Muir said this will involve behavior change and could provide a mindful break from the computer as people walk from their desk to the collection area.\nThese major changes follow a pilot done on 14 buildings, which increased the recycling rate by 29 to 44 percentage points in many areas. Stanford\u2019s most sustainable building, Y2E2, went from a 60% recycling rate to 89%.\nAt Stanford, Winslade said, ideas are constantly evolving, and innovative strategies are applied to reach zero waste, in a process that is reminiscent of the scientific method.\n\u201cI think viewing the campus as a living lab is the way of the future,\u201d said Winslade. \u201cWe\u2019re testing out our ideas; we\u2019re bringing the best practices and industry standards to create an efficient collection system.\u201d\nBut Winslade acknowledged that there is still a long way to go. Stanford is currently at 65% diversion of landfill waste, and there are less than eight years left to get to near 100. Studies show that by deploying various waste reduction strategies, such as enhancing reuse programs, moving to centralized collection of waste, expanding compost programs, and rethinking procurement programs, that number could easily be 96% \u2013 meeting the criteria for zero waste.\n\u201cThe next few years will be essential to take those big leaps forward,\u201d she said.\nEducation makes a big dent\nTo change behavior, Muir\u2019s team targets communication at a near-individual level by using technology to separate those who are recycling correctly and those who don\u2019t by location in a building.\n\n\nStanford goes platinum\nStanford\u2019s sustainability efforts are being recognized in other ways as well. In May, the university again earned the highest STARS rating of Platinum from the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE). Short for the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System, STARS measures and encourages sustainability in all aspects of higher education, including operations, academics, DEI, and more.\nOne point of distinction in the AASHE Platinum rating was the establishment of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. Set to launch this fall, Stanford\u2019s first new school in 70 years will catalyze interdisciplinary efforts to tackle urgent climate and sustainability challenges facing people and ecosystems worldwide.\nStanford has been participating in STARS for a decade, and this marks Stanford\u2019s third time earning a Platinum rating. Stanford is currently one of only approximately 15 institutions with a STARS Platinum rating.\n\u201cThis Platinum rating is a great reflection of intense collaboration across the campus with dozens of partners providing sustainability content and data,\u201d said Lincoln Bleveans, the executive director of Sustainability & Energy Management at Stanford.\n\n\u201cWe have this cool new app that monitors the contamination in bins,\u201d Muir said. \u201cRather than talking to the whole building, we can go, \u2018Oh, first floor on the right side, it seems like you\u2019re struggling a little bit. Someone doesn\u2019t know where their tea bags go.'\u201d (Tea bags go into the compost bin.)\nMuir says the most common mistake she sees is people putting paper towels in the landfill bin when they should go in the compost bin. Getting it right is important because incorrectly sorted waste gets sent to the landfill rather than being recycled or composted. The solutions, said Muir, are education and engagement that are also motivating.\n\u201cWaste is such a personal, individual action that people do,\u201d said Muir. \u201cLike 10 times a day, you\u2019re in front of the trashcan going, \u2018Okay, what do I do with this?\u2019 So we need individuals to participate.\u201d\nTo reach people where they\u2019re at, Muir and her team have created the Zero Waste Campus Committee, a group launching this year that gathers people from various academic units \u2013medical, education, law \u2013 who volunteer to become more educated about zero waste and, in return, educate their communities. Two big tasks will be learning how to recycle carpet and how to reduce the waste in the 36 cafes on campus.\nSmart solutions for students\nResidences and dining halls are where about 50% of Stanford waste originates. So, Kristin Parineh, sustainability manager for Residential & Dining Enterprises (R&DE), and her team use monitoring technology, surveys, and the latest ideas from waste reduction studies to support the journey to zero waste.\n\nWaste corrals outside Crothers Memorial Hall, which follows an \u201cequal and visible\u201d design theory that studies have shown can substantially reduce landfill. (Image credit: Keith Uyeda R&DE Video & Media Specialist)\n\nFor example, R&DE follows the \u201cequal and visible\u201d principle when designing enclosures, which research has shown can reduce landfill by over 30%. The principle states that in order to maximize sorting, each bin \u2013 recycling, compost, and landfill \u2013 must be the same size and equally visible from the entrance. Parineh and her team are also working with R&DE Strategic Communications to redesign waste rooms to be colorful, bright, and clean because they\u2019ve learned that one of the top deterrents to proper waste sorting is that students said the process is gross and smelly.\nR&DE Stanford Dining, Hospitality & Auxiliaries continues to lead campus-wide efforts to reduce food waste in all of its locations. It has committed to a 25% food waste reduction by the end of 2022.\nOn the residential side, when Parineh found that mini-fridges constitute a significant contribution to waste every June \u2013 more than half of the students bring mini-fridges into housing and then throw them away at the end of the year \u2013 Stanford decided to furnish them for the students who stayed on campus during stay-at-home orders to be re-used year after year.\nAnother program, Give & Go, developed by R&DE, kicked into high gear in May. Through that students can donate items in good condition to those in need during moveout. So far, in 10 years, more than 390 tons have been donated through the program. Students can recognize drop-off boxes by the alpaca mascot.\nParineh said the program hits the triple bottom line of sustainability: it\u2019s good for finances, people, and the environment.\nThat philosophy propels every sustainability project at Stanford, keeping the campus competitive enough to garner honors, like that of the Campus Race to Zero Waste.\n\u201cAt Stanford, we\u2019re always looking to do the right thing from a cost perspective, a customer service perspective, and a sustainability perspective,\u201d said Lincoln Bleveans, the executive director of Sustainability & Energy Management at Stanford. \u201cAnd if you work hard enough, those things shouldn\u2019t be mutually exclusive.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford News\nAwards\nSustainability\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to read next:\n\n\n\n\n \nAcademic Council\nReport of the president: Academic Council Professoriate appointments\nThe following Academic Council Professoriate appointments, promotions, and reappointments for the periods indicated were reviewed by the Advisory Board of the Academic Council on Jan. 17, Jan. 31, Feb. 7, Feb. 21, Feb. 28, and March 7, 2023, and were approved by the president.
