The admin_notices hook has served WordPress well and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. This project is focused on building a new framework for notifications from the ground up, and potentially providing a tool that encourages consistency in presentation, follows best practices in standards and accessibilityAccessibility Accessibility (commonly shortened to a11y) refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. The concept of accessible design ensures both \u201cdirect access\u201d (i.e. unassisted) and \u201cindirect access\u201d meaning compatibility with a person\u2019s assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers). (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility), and discourages spammy or disruptive interactions in the WordPress adminadmin (and super admin) screens.\nThe end result will be a RESTful model and APIAPI An API or Application Programming Interface is a software intermediary that allows programs to interact with each other and share data in limited, clearly defined ways. to be utilized by coreCore Core is the set of software required to run WordPress.

The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at https://make.wordpress.org/chat/. notifications outward from your WordPress website.\nAfter approximately three years of discussion, scaffolding, and design, the WordPress Notifications feature project is ready to begin collecting feedback on a static demo of the previously reviewed designs. We\u2019re inviting users to install the feature pluginFeature Plugin A plugin that was created with the intention of eventually being proposed for inclusion in WordPress Core. See Features as Plugins. on a test environment, view the static mockups, and provide feedback to the team.\u00a0\nHow To Install\nThe pluginPlugin A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party zip file can be downloaded from the Releases page of the Github repository, and installed like any other WordPress plugin.\nAlternatively, it can be installed via Composer:\nFirst add the repository to your composer.jsonJSON JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a minimal, readable format for structuring data. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML.\n{\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"type\": \"vcs\",\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"url\": \"https://github.com/WordPress/wp-feature-notifications\"\n}\nThen install the develop branchbranch A directory in Subversion. WordPress uses branches to store the latest development code for each major release (3.9, 4.0, etc.). Branches are then updated with code for any minor releases of that branch. Sometimes, a major version of WordPress and its minor versions are collectively referred to as a \"branch\", such as \"the 4.0 branch\". using the command composer require wordpress/wp-feature-notifications:dev-develop.\nHow To Test\nOnce installed and activated, the plugin will display three demo user interface elements for review:\nOn-page notifications \u2013 Similar to the current admin_notices hook, on-page notifications appear at the top of the Dashboard screen.The Hub \u2013 A new \u201cbell\u201d notifications icon on the right-hand side of the admin bar will open the \u201chub\u201d, a drawer of notifications.Notification Settings \u2013 Users can visit Settings > Notifications or click the link at the bottom of the Hub to see a preliminary draft of a settings table for managing notifications.It is important to note that this is a static, front-end demo, and the team is mainly looking for overall feedback about the initial direction of these components. For more context on the project, we recommend reviewing the Project Requirements and reviewing the initial Project designs.\u00a0\nLooking Ahead\nWe look forward to collecting your feedback in the comments below or in our Github issues. If you would like to contribute to the project, we invite you to join the #feature-notifications channel in the Making WordPress Slack for our weekly office hours every Wednesday at 14:00 UTC and are happy to welcome new contributors to the project.\nProps @psykro for editing and proofreading and @codekraft and @sephsekla for providing content.\n#feature-notificationsShare this:TwitterFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaspar H\u00fcbinger\n\n8:03 pm on July 21, 2022 \n\n\n\n\nNot sure if the following justifies one or more issues on GitHubGitHub GitHub is a website that offers online implementation of git repositories that can easily be shared, copied and modified by other developers. Public repositories are free to host, private repositories require a paid subscription. GitHub introduced the concept of the \u2018pull request\u2019 where code changes done in branches by contributors can be reviewed and discussed before being merged be the repository owner.  https://github.com/, so I\u2019ll just comment here.\nGenerally going in a good direction for me, great work!\nNot sure what the idea is when multiple messages appear on-page? Currently they take up the full height of my viewport (15\u2033 MacBook), which can\u2019t be the end goal I suppose? Even with customised notifications settings I would expect scenarios where multiple messages could appear on-page, and I\u2019d very much would like them not to.\nThe \u2018hub\u2019 looks slick and feels like what I\u2019d expect in a modern web app. Scroll behaviour needs a little love, when I\u2019m scrolling down the hub, it first scroll down the rest of the page. Also closing the hub on a small screen currently takes some figuring out. I had to fiddle for a moment to notice it closes when I click outside the hub. A close button would make this more intuitive for me.\nSide note: all action buttons in on-page notifications currently take me to GitHub. To avoid unnecessary confusion for testers I suggest changing those to a target within the WordPress adminadmin (and super admin).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Bossenger\n\n1:59 pm on July 22, 2022 \n\n\n\n\nNot sure what the idea is when multiple messages appear on-page?

I\u2019d like to see either an image or the ringing bell. Maybe a filterFilter Filters are one of the two types of Hooks https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Hooks. They provide a way for functions to modify data of other functions. They are the counterpart to Actions. Unlike Actions, filters are meant to work in an isolated manner, and should never have side effects such as affecting global variables and output.?\n\u2014\u2013\nI think the notification settings panel is as good as it\u2019s gonna get.\n\u2014\u2013\nI\u2019m assuming plugins will be able to register notification sources.

Personally I love it when an app let\u2019s you keep \u2018important\u2019 messages on but disable \u2018marketing\u2019 messages, but at this point, it would be up to the developer to set that up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoss Wintle\n\n1:28 pm on July 26, 2022 \n\n\n\n\nSo good to see progress on this. I will comment on the visual framework, but to be honest people could debate the visuals for weeks and never get anywhere, so while I give feedback as someone who\u2019s not really seen this before, I encourage you to make decisions and move forward!\n1. I think the new on-page notifications are too big \u2013 this is actually quite problematic on mobile. I like the more modern style (though look out for the possible admin resdesign coming down the line too) but I\u2019d prefer something more like the existing size.\nWe probably can\u2019t avoid animated images being used, but I really don\u2019t like the animated image being used.\n2. Assuming the coloured dots are for severityseverity The seriousness of the ticket in the eyes of the reporter. Generally, severity is a judgment of how bad a bug is, while priority is its relationship to other bugs.? This seems too small to me. Can\u2019t the bars on the left be used for severity colours?\n3. I love the Hub, but it needs a close affordance/button. I would also love for:\n  a) Notification settings for a given source to be available in the hub. e.g. click a button on the notification in the hub and get the chance to disable/enable notifications, without needing to visit the separate settings page. This would enable me to say \u201cI don\u2019t want these notices\u201d but while keeping me in the flow of viewing my notices. Like how the iOSiOS The operating system used on iPhones and iPads. notification center works (see this, this and this)\n4. As a future thought, I\u2019d love the unread notifications to appear as pop-up \u201ctoasts\u201d before making it into the hub. (Personally, I think the on-page notifications should work like this too, but I suspect I\u2019m too late to contribute that idea, and what we have is fine.)\n4b. You could probably easily use JavaScriptJavaScript JavaScript or JS is an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. WordPress makes extensive use of JS for a better user experience. While PHP is executed on the server, JS executes within a user\u2019s browser. https://www.javascript.com/. to optionally and progressively enhance the unread notifications section in this way.\nHope that helps.

The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. editor UIUI User interface are a good step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoss Wintle\n\n1:35 pm on July 26, 2022 \n\n\n\n\nIf it helps, I made an Insta WP template to quickly launch WordPress with the pluginPlugin A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website.

Introducing images to notifications (especially animated ones \ud83d\ude2b) is a huge increase in visual clutter. And with this design, just one notification takes up the same vertical space as two or three current adminadmin (and super admin) notices. \nI would prefer something like the text on the left, with the CTA button, close link, and date/source all on the right, and no image. This would reduce the height by about 50%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Bailey-Roberts\n\n3:39 pm on July 26, 2022 \n\n\n\n\nThe size concern is a very valid point, thanks for the feedback!\nOne thing I will say is that the on-page notifications should be both infrequent and important \u2013 anything else should be delegated to the hub only. The demo shows a lot at once just to show off the different options, but in practice this would ideally very rarely have more than one visible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian Coords\n\n5:57 pm on July 26, 2022 \n\n\n\n\nAll valid points.

Then again, if the on-page notifications are only for state changes and not marketing, maybe we don\u2019t need it? Maybe we should instead have the smaller icon next to the title (similar to the hub)?\nI also wonder if showing so many variants in the mockup was more distracting than helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPablo Postigo\n\n4:32 pm on July 26, 2022 \n\n\n\n\nGlad to see this initiative finally getting traction.
