Combine that love and aspiration for music, and you get a boombox on wheels. Beating the odds and losing his mom at the age of eighteen, Lopez knew he wanted to fulfill his moms dreams for him and go to UC Riverside. Making music was his spiritual and therapeutic outlet during this time while he attended school. His dream was to share the love his mom gave him to the world and channel that through music. As a past Coachella artist, Lopez was the perfect alumnus to show Coachella goers and future students that UC Riverside is a place where you can live your dreams and build your full potential at full volume.\n\u00a0Watch Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACADEMIC CALENDAR\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nView Calendar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn How Affordable a UCR Degree Can Be\nGrants, scholarships, loans, and work study are offered to UC Riverside students, who receive some of the most generous financial aid packages in the nation.
