Through her straightforward and light-hearted style, Robin has taught hundreds of thousands of people how to make their designs look professional using four surprisingly simple principles. Now in its fourth edition,\u00a0The Non-Designer\u2019s Design Book\u00a0offers even more practical design advice, including a new chapter on the fundamentals of typography, more quizzes and exercises to train your Designer Eye, updated projects for you to try, and new visual and typographic examples to inspire your creativity.\u00a0   Whether you\u2019re a Mac user or a Windows user, a type novice, or an aspiring graphic designer, you will find the instruction and inspiration to approach any design project with confidence.  THIS ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO DESIGN WILL TEACH YOU\u00a0   The four principles of design that underlie \u00a0every design project\u00a0 How to design with color\u00a0 How to design with type\u00a0 How to combine typefaces for maximum effect\u00a0 How to see and think like a professional designer\u00a0 Specific tips on designing newsletters, brochures, flyers, and other projects\u00a0   SynopsisA lot has happened in the world of digital design since the first edition of this title was published, but one thing remains true: There is an ever-growing number of people attempting to design everything from newsletters to advertisements with no formal training. This book is the one place they can turn to find quick, non-intimidating, excellent design help from trusted design instructor Robin Williams. \u00a0 This revised and expanded classic includes a new chapter on designing with type, more quizzes and exercises, updated projects, and new visual and typographic examples that give the book a fresh, modern look.\u00a0In The Non-Designer's Design Book,\u00a04th\u00a0Edition,\u00a0Robin turns her attention to the basic principles that govern good design. Perfect for beginners, Robin boils great design into four easy-to-master principles: contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity (C.R.A.P.!). Readers who follow her clearly explained concepts will produce more sophisticated and professional work immediately. Humor-infused, jargon-free prose interspersed with design exercises, quizzes, and illustrations make learning a snap\u2013which is just what audiences have come to expect from this bestselling author. \u00a0About the Author Robin Williams is the author of dozens of bestselling and award-winning books, including The Non-Designer's Presentation Book, The Non-Designer's InDesign Book, and The Mac is not a typewriter. Through her writing, teaching, and seminars, Robin has educated and influenced an entire generation of computer users in the areas of design, typography, desktop publishing, the Mac, and the Web.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Our Readers Are Saying\n\n\nBe the first to share your thoughts on this title!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct DetailsISBN:9780133966152Binding:Trade PaperbackPublication date:11/19/2014Publisher:Peachpit PressPages:240Height:.40INWidth:6.90INThickness:.50Illustration:YesAuthor:Robin, Dr WilliamsAuthor:Robin WilliamsAuthor:Robin Williams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n 0.00 \n Trade Paperback \n\n Ships in 1 to 3 days \n    \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceive an email when this ISBN is available used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp\nGuarantee\nMy Account\nCareers \nAbout Us \nSecurity\nWish List\nPartners\nContact Us\nShipping\nTransparency ACT MRF\nSitemap\n\u00a9 2023 POWELLS.COM  Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n{1}\n\n\n##LOC[OK]##\n##LOC[Cancel]##\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
