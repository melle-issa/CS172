We recognize that to create an inclusive and intellectually vibrant community, we must understand and value both our individual differences and our common ground.\n\n\nThe University of California emphasizes its commitment to the full realization of its historic promise to recognize and nurture merit, talent, and achievement by supporting diversity and equal opportunity in its education, services and administration, as well as research and creative activity. The university particularly acknowledges the acute need to remove barriers to the recruitment, retention, and advancement of talented students, faculty and staff from historically excluded populations who are currently underrepresented.\nThere are a multitude of ways to discover the value of diversity and inclusion at UC Davis. Browse our site and learn about our mission and our values, find resources and communities, take professional classes in DEI, and gain the tools to implement equity and inclusion across the campus.\n\u00a0\nView a timeline on the history of DEI at UCD\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout DEI\n\n\nLeadership and Staff\n\n\nOur Units\n\n\nOur Centers\n\n\nOur Strategic Vision\n\n\nPrinciples of Community\n\n\nLand Acknowledgement\n\n\nPublic Statements\n\n\nReports\n\n\nValues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of California, Davis, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616 | 530-752-1011\n\nQuestions or comments?
