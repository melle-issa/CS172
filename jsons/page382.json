Acknowledgment\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Land Acknowledgment?\n\n\nA Land Acknowledgment is a formal statement that recognizes and respects Indigenous\n                                             peoples as traditional stewards of a given geographic area and the enduring relationship\n                                             that exists between Indigenous Peoples and their ancestral territories. For San Diego\n                                             State, we recognize the land as Kumeyaay.\n                                          \n\n\n\n\nWhy is a Land Acknowledgment important?\n\n\n\nRecognizing the land is a practice that honors and respects contemporary Indigenous\n                                                peoples\u2019 connection to their land since time immemorial. Using a Land Acknowledgment\n                                                is a way to express gratitude and appreciation for those whose territory one resides\n                                                or works on. From an Indigenous perspective, it is important for people to understand\n                                                the history that brought them to the land and that people seek to comprehend their\n                                                place within that history. This is especially important since most Indigenous peoples\n                                                were dispossessed of their lands through deceptive processes. The land San Diego State\n                                                currently occupies, for example, was never legally ceded by Kumeyaay people through\n                                                treaty or sale.\n                                             \nMost Indigenous people consider colonialism as a current and ongoing process. Land\n                                                Acknowledgments serve to build mindfulness and awareness of colonialism, both past\n                                                and present. Acknowledging the land is also a common protocol practiced by Indigenous\n                                                peoples and allies worldwide\n                                             \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0How do I use a Land Acknowledgment?\n\n\n\nWherever you travel, you can acknowledge the Indigenous people of the territory that\n                                                you are on. One helpful resource to use is https://native-land.ca/, a database that recognizes the traditional territories across North and South America\n                                                as well as Australia and New Zealand.\n                                             \nMuch of the central, southern, and east San Diego County is Kumeyaay territory; while\n                                                most of North County is Luise\u00f1o traditional homelands. Concise acknowledgments can\n                                                consist of: \u201cI want to take a moment to acknowledge that we are on the traditional\n                                                territory of the Kumeyaay [or insert other nation name(s)].\u201d If you are at an event\n                                                at another university campus in San Diego County, be sure to ask a representative\n                                                of that campus for their Land Acknowledgment statement.\n                                             \nTo include in your email signature please use:\nIndigenous Residence: Kumeyaay\nIndigenous land borrowing/occupying: The Kumeyaay\nFor events on campus at San Diego State, please use the full or abbreviated Land Acknowledgment\n                                                statement below: Kumeyaay Land Acknowledgment created by Mike Connolly Miskwish (Kumeyaay)\n                                             \n[Full Version] We stand upon a land that carries the footsteps of millennia of Kumeyaay\n                                                people. They are a people whose traditional lifeways intertwine with a worldview of\n                                                earth and sky in a community of living beings. This land is part of a relationship\n                                                that has nourished, healed, protected and embraced the Kumeyaay people to the present\n                                                day. It is part of a world view founded in the harmony of the cycles of the sky and\n                                                balance in the forces of life. For the Kumeyaay, red and black represent the balance\n                                                of those forces that provide for harmony within our bodies as well as the world around\n                                                us. As students, faculty, staff and alumni of San Diego State University we acknowledge\n                                                this legacy from the Kumeyaay. We promote this balance in life as we pursue our goals\n                                                of knowledge and understanding. We find inspiration in the Kumeyaay spirit to open\n                                                our minds and hearts. It is the legacy of the red and black. It is the land of the\n                                                Kumeyaay.\n                                             \nEyay e\u2019Hunn My heart is good.\n                                             \n[Abbreviated Version] For millennia, the Kumeyaay people have been a part of this\n                                                land. This land has nourished, healed, protected and embraced them for many generations\n                                                in a relationship of balance and harmony.
