Their efforts earned $175,000 from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and its Monarch Butterfly and Pollinators Conservation Fund, as well as an additional $245,000 from the tribe.

But habitat loss threatens the future of not just the butterflies, but other pollinators essential to the nation\u2019s ecosystems.\n\u201cWe have to do something now, before it\u2019s too late,\u201d said California State University, Northridge philosophy student Ethan Walsh, a senior in CSUN\u2019s College of Humanities.\nWalsh, 25, of Woodland Hills, is grants program manager for Land Relief, a nonprofit organization that has partnered with the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians to improve pollinator habitats on Chumash ancestral lands. Their efforts earned $175,000 from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and its Monarch Butterfly and Pollinators Conservation Fund, as well as an additional $245,000 from the tribe.\nCSUN philosophy major Ethan Walsh collecting seeds from a native milkweed plant. Photo courtesy of Ethan Walsh.\nWalsh and Land Relief \u2014 which was founded by his mother, Christina Walsh \u2014 are working with the Chumash to restore and improve habitats for monarch butterflies and other pollinators. They are planting pollinator hedgerows and seedlings at three sites on 210 acres of ancestral land in the Santa Ynez Valley. As a result, about 140 acres of habitat being improved.\n\u201cCreating space for pollinators on ancestral land provides a unique opportunity to improve the native habitat, enhancing natural pollinator corridors, which support the urgent migratory needs of the monarch butterflies along with the nectar and habitat needs of other native pollinators,\u201d Walsh said.\nThe restoration efforts center around native milkweed, the only plant monarch butterflies will eat. Native milkweed has been rapidly disappearing due to increased land development and the widespread spraying of weedkiller pesticides.\nWalsh and his mother have spent years collecting the seeds of milkweed plants native to the region. They harvest seeds from plants in local woodlands and from the dozens of plants they have growing in their backyard.\n\u201cYou can find tropical milkweed in commercial nurseries, but it\u2019s not native to the region and really isn\u2019t environmentally friendly because it requires too much water,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, native milkweed is what the monarchs are looking for when they\u2019re migrating.\u201d\nThe Walshes have collected 2 pounds of native milkweed seeds so far, and they aim to collect 7 pounds total. They are cultivating seedlings to plant in hedgerows \u2014 closely spaced shrubs or trees planted to form a barrier, or to mark a boundary \u2014 with other pollinator-friendly plants. The goal is to protect them from other aggressive plant species, and to ensure enough milkweed survives to provide sustenance to the monarch butterflies along their migratory route.\nThe idea for the hedgerows, Walsh said, was inspired by a CSUN course he took last year in philosophy of environmental science.\n\u201cI was looking at the different aspects of permaculture, aquaculture and pollinators,\u201d he said. \u201cAmong the things I came across were hedgerows. It\u2019s very common for farmers to use hedgerows to protect their crops. They usually have a very industrial look because they\u2019re built on these giant plots of land.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at creating more natural, spiral extensions that go along the riverbeds, where milkweed and other pollinating plants might naturally be found \u2014 or where there are bunches of trees along the monarchs\u2019 migratory route where they can be protected from harsh weather,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cWe are trying to fill in the gaps caused by land development and commercial agriculture along the monarchs\u2019 migratory route.\u201d\nWalsh and his mother are working closely with members of the Chumash tribe to identify the ideal areas on their land to plant the hedgerows. In addition to milkweed, the hedgerows will include other native plants that attract pollinators.\n\u201cIn addition to repairing the gaps along the monarchs\u2019 migratory route, we also hope to restore native vegetation that once populated the Chumash\u2019s ancestral lands,\u201d Walsh said.\nWhile their work is concentrated on Chumash land, Walsh said, they hope that Mother Nature will lend a hand in helping to spread the seeds of native pollinator-attractive plants elsewhere.\n\u201cIf we do this right, and establish the hedgerows in the right, pollinator-friendly places \u2014 \u00a0along the river and near protective trees \u2014 we will have reestablished a key point along the migratory path, while at the same time restoring the lands to the way they once were before colonialism and rampant development,\u201d Walsh said.\nThe project also includes the establishment of a teaching and demonstration site at the Chumash information center, so visitors can learn about habitat restoration efforts and perhaps take lessons learned and apply them in their own communities.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want what we are doing to be kept a secret,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cWe and the Chumash tribal leaders want to share so that others can learn from what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\nHe noted his work with the Chumash and his studies at CSUN have inspired him to pursue a doctorate in the philosophy of environmental science. \u201cThe one class I took a couple semesters ago just turned my world upside down and showed me what I wanted to do with my life,\u201d he said.\nWalsh said that for decades, environmental science and decisions regarding the environment were usually based on a singular perspective that reflected the desires of the dominant culture.\n\u201cOne of my goals is to ensure that as many perspectives as possible are considered when it comes to decisions regarding the environment and environmental science,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only have one planet, and we need to start caring for it properly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Featured, Habitat restoration, Monarch Butterflies, pollinators, Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n\n\n\nStudying Away \u2013 Get to Know the International and Exchange Student Center\n\n\nNew Tech and a Sense of Community: CSUN\u2019s Assistive Technology Conference Celebrates 38 Years\n\n\nCSUN to host multimedia performance that explores climate change\n\n\n\u2018Ghosts\u2019 Stories: On a Hit TV Show, CSUN Alum Uses His Voice\n\n\nTribal Leader, Philanthropist and Acclaimed Author to Receive Honorary Doctorates from CSUN\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u2190 CSUN Students Partner with Alum to Help Unhoused Community College Students\nSpring Semester 2023 is Here! \u2192\n\n\n\n\n Top Stories\n\n\n\nFeatured Tag\n\n\n\n\n\n \u2018Ghosts\u2019 Stories: On a Hit TV Show, CSUN Alum Uses His Voice\non April 26, 2023in Alumni, Arts and Culture\n\n\n Tribal Leader, Philanthropist and Acclaimed Author to Receive Honorary Doctorates from CSUN\non April 25, 2023in Alumni, Community, CSU News, CSUN Events, Education, Faculty and Staff News, Graduation Ceremony, Honors & Awards, Media Releases, University News\n\n\n CSUN Breaks Ground on Autodesk Technology Engagement Center, a Project with National Impact\non April 24, 2023in Donor Profile, Giving\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCSU Resources CSU Leader\nCSYouCSU News\n\nTopicsArts and Culture\nAthletics\nBusiness\nCommunity\nCSU News\nEducation\nFaculty and Staff News\nHealth and Fitness\nMedia Releases\nPolitics and Society\nScience and Technology\n CSUN in the News\n\nCalifornia State University Northridge President Dr. Erika D.
