You can count on the BuddyPress core team\u2019s passion to carry on working on fixing bugs and improving features.\n\nLet\u2019s come together and reverse the trend!\nConfronted by extraordinary difficulty, people from a family, a tribe, a team, a community, a company, a country, a continent, earth, temporarily forget about their individual need or personal feelings and unite together to find the best way to deal with this difficulty. This is happening because we know that if everyone focuses on a general benefit, we\u2019ll have a better chance of achieving that benefit than if each of us tries to satisfy our own goals.\nI believe the English quote for this idea is \u201cIn unity there is strength\u201c.\nMore than ever, BuddyPress needs you to contribute to beta testing, support, documentation, translations and, of course, code.\nAs a start, we\u2019d love to hear your voice about this simple question:\nIn your opinion, what is the most important thing that BuddyPress is missing?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Share your thoughts\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nPlease, tell us about it by replying to this forum topic. Feel free to talk about every aspect of the project and to suggest ways to do better. If you could then take an extra step and share the link of this post or this topic with your friends, that would be awesome. Thanks in advance for your help \ud83d\ude0d.\nWe (the BuddyPress software & community) are 14 years old. We were the first plugin to extend WordPress with community features, giving users a free and open source alternative to commercial \u201cSocial Media\u201d (social network companies whose end goal is to sell advertisements based on your data).\u00a0\nWith WordPress and BuddyPress: you keep the freedom to share, data ownership and the control of every aspect of your community site. The BuddyPress core team is committed to preserving this free and totally open source tool for anyone.\n\n\nOne Response to \u201cLet\u2019s talk about us, BuddyPress!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBP Dev-Chat summary : September 21, 2022 | BP Dev Updates says: \n\nOctober 4, 2022 at 8:22 pm \n[\u2026] threads here & here. On this subject, we\u2019ve done what we wrote: we\u2019ve published a post explaining the situation and also called for feedbacks and contributions to reverse this trend!
