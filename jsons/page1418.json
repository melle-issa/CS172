Its educational administration program was No. 26, matching last year\u2019s ranking.The No. 3 ranking for the master of science degree in rehabilitation counseling, part of the Administration, Rehabilitation & Postsecondary Education department in the College of Education, also is its highest position ever. Its graduates are trained for positions as vocational rehabilitation counselors and evaluators and assistive technology specialists, among other careers.\"We're the highest ranked program without a doctoral program in rehabilitation counseling, so I think that says a lot about our quality and national standing,\" said Charles Degeneffe, professor and chair in the Department of Administration, Rehabilitation and Postsecondary Education. \u201cWe maintain local, state, national and international reach through our professional engagement, scholarly engagement, and teaching and service activities,\" he added. \"Our ranking is also reflective of the work of the Interwork Institute, which is closely affiliated to the academic program and our department. The Institute secures millions in grants and contracts annually that results in applied work to advance rehabilitation counseling practice on a local, state, national, and international basis.\"The SDSU program has about 100 students and has produced more than 1,000 graduates since the 1970\u2019s. Only the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Michigan State University were ranked higher for rehabilitation counseling on the 2023-24 list of more than 90 schools.Health fieldIn addition, the School of Public Health is ranked No. 28, and it was ranked No. 47 for a new master\u2019s level ranking within the health field, health care management. The school also offers master\u2019s degrees in epidemiology, and health promotion and behavioral science.\u201cAchieving our college's highest-ever ranking is a remarkable accomplishment for which our entire community of faculty, staff, students, and alumni should be very proud,\" said Y. Barry Chung, dean of the College of Education. \"So many have contributed to our collective reputation for preparing high quality teachers, counselors, therapists, psychologists, student affairs professionals, educational leaders and more. Seeing these difference makers and change agents thrive in our schools and communities is our most important benchmark for success.\u201dPrinceton ReviewSeparately, SDSU was No. 41 in the \u201cBest Value Colleges\u201d for 2023 by The Princeton Review, also released on April 25. The company assessed public colleges and universities for their return on investment, based on factors which include college costs, financial aid, academic selectivity, admissions and students\u2019 ratings. In addition, SDSU was No. 13 among public universities in \u201cBest Schools for Making an Impact.\u201d an assessment based in part on student survey questions covering community service opportunities, sustainability efforts, and on-campus student engagement.The Princeton Review provides college admissions, test preparation and tutoring services. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\nLatest Stories\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nWomen\u2019s Hall of Fame Honors Professor Emerita Huma Ahmed-GhoshSan Diego ROTC Units Perform Snapdragon Stadium\u2019s First Military ParadeSDSU Again Named Fulbright HSI LeaderSDSU President Emerita Sally Roush, 1947-2022Inflation and the Economy: What to Expect in the Second Half of \u201922Terrible with NamesMoney Magazine\u2019s Best Colleges for Value Ranks SDSUSchool of Public Health Draws a Top 20 RankingMy, How You\u2019ve Grown: New Species of Bacteria is a Shapeshifter ExtraordinaireApplications On Track to Set a New Record as SDSU Expands Student Support InitiativesTemporary Shift to Virtual Instruction AnnouncedBlack Resource Center Director Named\n\n\nBROWSE ALL RELATED\n\n\n\n\nSeeman, Sato Named to All Mountain West TeamsSDSU Deepens Ties to OaxacaSDSU Wins Second Straight MW ChampionshipFour Aztecs Earn All-Mountain West HonorsSDSU's Class of 2023: Best Spots on Campus to Take Grad PhotosSDSU Imperial Valley Partnership Opens Doors to Higher Education for Foster YouthWater Polo: Legaspi and Valdes Earn GCC Postseason HonorsSDSU Educator Works to Improve Safety, Inclusion for LGBTQIA+ YouthAztec Baseball Collects Two MW Weekly HonorsEmployee Resource Group Sets Sights on a Broader ReachThe Road to SDSU\u2019s Senior Design Day 2023More than Learning to Walk Backward\n\n\nBROWSE ALL LATEST\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossing the Line\n\n\n                                                                \n                                                                Ongoing through Thursday, May 4, 2023, 4pm The San Diego State University School of Art and Design presents Crossing the Line at the University Art Gallery through Thursday, May 4, 2023.Crossing the Line features the artwork of 29 local artists, faculty, and alumni of the School of Art and Design, whose work examines the notion of boundaries and borders.
