Enjoy the pursuit.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Elaine Chao (first Asian-American woman to serve in a Presidential Cabinet)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are hereDiversity, Equity and Inclusion Home \u203a Celebrating Heritage and Identity \u203a  \nAsian American & Pacific Islander Heritage Month\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay is Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, during which we celebrate the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders whose rich heritage has shaped the history of the United States while having their lives dramatically influenced by moments in its history. At Sonoma State University, we traditionally celebrate AAPI Heritage Month in April while most of our students, staff, and faculty are present, and so we can provide\u00a0a full month to recognize our Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Other Pacific Islander communities.\nWe want to particularly begin this month by bringing attention to and condemning the violence and hatred that has been directed at the Asian and Pacific Islander community.\u00a0The 2022\u00a0AAPI Heritage Month Planning Committee will be host and co-sponsor events for SSU students, staff, and faculty\u00a0in solidarity against racism, coming\u00a0together as a community, and celebrating\u00a0the richness of Asian American Pacific Islander communities.\n\nAbout API Heritage Month\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI Heritage Month - known as Asian Pacific American Heritage month until 2009 - recognizes the\u00a022.2 million Asians and 1.6 million Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander\u00a0communities in the United States.\nIn 1992, New York Congressmen\u00a0Frank Hortin introduced the bill\u00a0that called for the month of May to officially be designated Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month. The idea for the month originated with Jeanie F. Jew, a staff person on Capitol Hill at the time and a board member of the\u00a0Organization of Chinese Americans. With celebrations for Black History Month and Hispanic Heritage month already in place, Jeanie F. Jew was concerned about the lack of recognition given to\u00a0Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\nThe month of May was selected for two reasons: first, to commemorate the arrival of the first known Japanese immigrant to the\u00a0U.S. on May 7, 1843;\u00a0second, to honor the completion of the transcontinental railroad on May 10, 1869, which\u00a0upwards of 20,000 Chinese workers\u00a0helped to construct. The month pays tribute to the generations of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who have enriched\u00a0United States history and are instrumental in its future success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month Proclamation from City of Rohnert Park\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday, April 25th\u00a0| 5:00pm - 6:00pm\u00a0| Rohnert Park City Council Meeting\nThe Rohnert Park City Council is issuing a\u00a0proclamation\u00a0in support of Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month!

Join Erin Masako Wilkins of Herb Folk for a talk on Asian American herbalism and traditional healing practices. We will learn about culturally relevant herbs to support your own Qi energy for mental and physical wellness. And she will share her experience working as a clinical herbalist and small business owner in Sonoma County. There will be an herbal tea tasting, guided Qi Gong meditation, and open discussion.\nErin Masako Wilkins is an Asian American herbalist and acupuncturist.
