Participants are expected to commit three to five hours per week to the program, for which they will receive a total of three semester internship credits.\u00a0\nThis year\u2019s cohort consists of 18 students selected from 14 independent colleges and universities in California. The students are grouped in three divisions \u2013 the policy and budget committee, the communications committee and the research committee. Huynh, currently in her third year at Chapman, is serving as the co-chair of the policy and budget committee for this year\u2019s cohort.\u00a0\n\u201cI am responsible for leading my cohort in research bills, communicating with policymakers, as well as advocating for bills in various ways,\u201d she says. \u201cI am very interested in advocating for equity in financial aid, as well as aiding students from various backgrounds in the fight for higher education.\u201d\nThis is the first time in more than five years that Chapman has had a student in this program, according to Jonathan Charres, assistant director of diversity and outreach for Chapman\u2019s office of undergraduate financial aid. Charres spearheaded the effort to restore Chapman\u2019s participation in the program this year.\nAccording to Charres, the program allows students to sit down face to face with state lawmakers who represent Orange County.\n\u201cStudents will be able to share their own experiences in higher education and advocate for initiatives, like the Cal-Grant program, and how they have impacted their academic success,\u201d he says.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are happy to have Trinity in the program,\u201d says Susan Reyes, AICCU advocacy manager and the site internship advisor. \u201cShe is already one of our all-stars and we appreciate how she actively engaged in the ICCAP orientation and training and has taken a leadership role as co-chair of the policy and budget advocacy team.\u201d\nFounded in 1955, AICCU is comprised of over 85 independent, nonprofit colleges and universities in California and works to articulate the principles and priorities of its institutions in the higher education ecosystem of California.\nLearn more about the political science major in Wilkinson College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences.\n\n\nAICCU government policy ICCAP internships political science public policy \n\n\n\n\n \n\nStaci Dumoski \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAP NEWS: Biden aims to deliver reassurance in State of Union address\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack History Month Events at Chapman University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership That Spans the Campus Jack of all trades Kyle Tanimura is leaving quite the lasting mark on Chapman, where he has taken on multiple leadership roles as a double major in political science and strategic and corporate communication, with a...\n\n\nMay 1, 2023 Jennifer Winfield\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Pacific Islander Desi American Heritage Month Events at Chapman University Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Heritage Month, which runs from May 1 to 31, celebrates the identities, histories and experiences of the APIDA community.
