We recognize the ongoing challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, including limited access to admission testing worldwide, and as a result, our test optional policy will extend to applicants applying for Fall 2023 and Fall 2024 entry terms. See detailsStanford is committed to a holistic review of all candidates. We consider the vast array of information provided in and with each student\u2019s application, whether that information includes test scores or not. Students may continue to self-report test scores in their application if they would like. Applications without test scores will not be at a disadvantage.\n\nThe NCAA Eligibility Center has announced a standardized testing policy for students who intend to play NCAA Division I or II sports starting in the 2022\u201323 academic year. \u201cStudents who initially enroll full time during the 2021\u201322 or 2022\u201323 academic years and intend to play NCAA Division I or II athletics will not be required to take a standardized test to meet NCAA initial-eligibility requirements.\u201d Please check the NCAA eligibility website for updates to NCAA requirements for future academic years.\n \n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n\nRegister for an Admission Program \n                  or Campus Tour \nExplore academic majors \nCalculate tuition costs \nCheck application status \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n Watch Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow @EngageStanford\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrograms\n\nAdmission Forums, Student Programs, and Special Events \n\n\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nStanford Preview\nStanford Viewbook\n\n\n\n\n Join the Mailing List \n\n Contact Us \n University Policies\n\n\n\nEngage with Us\n \n\n \n\n\n\nStanford complies with the Jeanne Clery Act and publishes crime statistics for the most recent three-year period.
