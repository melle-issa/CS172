We accomplish this by serving as custodian of all student records in accordance with university policies and government statutes as well as managing the student information system for all areas related to enrollment/registration, course information and scheduling, grading/transcript production, and ultimately degree clearance and certification. The Office of the Registrar strives to utilize technology-based solutions when possible to increase efficiencies and data integrity in these critical areas as well as support the overall needs of the academic community.\nThe Registrar's Office is located on the third floor of Page-Robinson Hall, 69 Brown Street (on the corner of Brown and Waterman streets across from the Faunce House Arch).\n2021-2022 Office of the Registrar Annual Report\n2020-2021 Office of the Registrar Annual Report\n2019-2020 Office of the Registrar Annual Report\n2018-2019 Office of the Registrar Annual Report\n2017-2018 Office of the Registrar Annual Report\n2016-2017 Office of the Registrar Annual Report\n2015-2016 Office of the Registrar Annual Report\n\nRelated Files\n\n\n2018-2019 Office of the Registrar Annual Report \n\n2017-2018 Office of the Registrar Annual Report \n\n2016-2017 Office of the Registrar Annual Report \n\n2015-2016 Office of the Registrar Annual Report \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Calendar\nAcademic Records\nUniversity Bulletin\nCourse Enrollment\nDegree Guidelines\nFinal Exams\nFaculty/Staff Resources\nUniversity Scheduling Office\nClassroom Assignments & Locations\nContact Us\n\n\n\nGateways\n\n\nFor StudentsFor FacultyFor Staff\n\n\n\n\nPrint this Page\n\nShare this Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the Registrar\nBrown University\n\nBox K\n69 Brown Street\n\t\tPage-Robinson Hall, 3rd floor\nProvidence, RI 02912\n\nPhone 401-863-2500\nFax 401-863-7542\n[email\u00a0protected]\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Calendar\n\n\n\n\nMay\n1\n\n\n\n\nAll Day\n\n\nDeadline for undergraduates to request a personal leave (including employment and military leave) or to request Full-time Study Away status for Fall.
