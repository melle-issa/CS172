Click here:\u00a0Game Console/TV/Streaming Device\u00a0\nKnown Issues\nAbout our Available Wireless Networks\nEduroam\nThe eduroam wireless network (SSID) is the premiere service for all campus students, faculty, and staff, offering the highest level of security, convenience, access, and enhanced services. The eduroam service uses authentication and encryption to keep your communication secure, all of which happens automatically once your device is configured for the network: as you come into range, your device will log you in, giving seamless \u2018roam on\u2019 access. Once your device is configured for the eduroam network, you\u2019ll also be granted guest access when visiting thousands of partner\u00a0universities in the US\u00a0and\u00a0worldwide\u00a0\u2013 with the same seamless, secure access you\u2019ll experience on our campus! For more information about eduroam, visit our\u00a0support pages (above), or just dive in and\u00a0get configured!\ncsuchico\nThe \"csuchico\" wireless network (SSID) is for devices incapable of supporting the more secure network protocols used by\u00a0eduroam, such as gaming consoles, smart TVs, etc.\ncsuchico-guest\nThe csuchico-guest network name (SSID) is a courtesy network intended for the use of campus guests. All Chico State students, faculty, and staff should use one of the above networks for wireless service, not csuchico-guest \u2013 the guest network offers limited bandwidth and limited access to campus resources. Campus guests and visitors can follow these instructions to connect to guest wireless:\u00a0Connecting to \"csuchico-guest\" Wireless.\nWireless Device Requirements\nA few things need to be in place for you to successfully access the campus\u00a0wireless services:\n\nA\u00a0device that is compatible with modern 802.11 wireless standards:\n\t\nWi-Fi 3/802.11g,\u00a0Wi-Fi 4/802.11n,\u00a0Wi-Fi 5/802.11ac & Wi-Fi 6/802.11ax\u00a0are currently supported\nWi-Fi 1/802.11a & Wi-Fi 2/802.11b legacy devices are not supported.\nWireless printers are NOT supported on any of the campus wireless networks at this time.\n\n\nBe sure that you are in an area of campus that has\u00a0wireless coverage\u00a0\u2013 all regular campus buildings have full coverage, but outdoor service is only available in limited areas.\nYour wireless device must meet at least some minimum security requirements (Phones/Tablets/Game Consoles are excluded from this):\n\t\nThe device must be running an operating system supported by its manufacturer (Windows XP support ended in early 2014; Windows 7 ended in 2020).\nThe device must be set to automatically install operating system patches issued by the manufacturer.\nLaptop operating systems (Windows, MacOS) must have up-to-date anti-virus/malware software installed.\n\n\n\nFeedback\nPlease do not leave the comment section blank!
