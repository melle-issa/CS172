The presentation will trace the pathways starting from the algorithmic music-generating machines of the 1950s, the deterministic generators of the 1970s, the pioneering work of David Cope (Experiments in Musical Intelligence) in the 1980s-1990s, and finally ending with contemporary AI-assisted composition. David will show how modern musicians can access AI for their own music activities, not as a substitute for human creativity, but as a valuable interactive tool to generate ideas that make us think and hear differently.David Dvorin is an Emmy-nominated composer, guitarist, author, and educator who has had his concert music performed in numerous new music and multimedia festivals around the United States and Europe. Versatile in both electronic and acoustic music mediums, he has written for and collaborated with such notable artists as Terry Riley, the California E.A.R. Unit and the Kronos Quartet. Regarded internationally as an expert on Apple\u2019s Logic Pro software, his textbook, Logic Pro X: Advanced Music Production has been adopted by educational institutions worldwide, and is the basis for Apple Computer\u2019s certified training. David has been on the faculty at California State University, Chico since 2006, teaching composition, electronic music and recording arts. In addition to his teaching and artistic activities, he is also the Artistic Director for the annual New Music Symposium, which showcases the work of young composers and brings acclaimed contemporary composers and performers to the North State area of California.\n                        Visiting Scholars\n                    \n                        University Film Series\n                    \n                        Tertulias\n                    \n                        Work-In-Progress Series\n                    \n                        Digital Humanities Series\n                    \n                        Panel Discussions\n                    SoundscapesThe 2022-2023 Humanities Center theme, Soundscapes, explores perceptions and interpretations of acoustic environments in their respective cultural, political, and spatial contexts.\u00a0 Ranging from the sounds of nature to a multitude of expressive forms such as music, poetry, dance, and storytelling, every culture has created distinctive soundscapes that shape our daily experiences and mediate our relationships to the world.\u00a0 Events will highlight interdisciplinary humanities research and creative activity on this year\u2019s theme.\u00a0\n                Give a Gift\n    (opens in new window)College of Humanities & Fine Arts (HFA)Arts & Humanities Building Room 279 Zip 0800530-898-5351hfa@csuchico.eduwww.csuchico.edu/hfaSupport Our CollegeProgram PortfolioHFA Majors & ProgramsArt & Art HistoryComparative Religion &\u00a0HumanitiesEnglishHistoryLanguages & CulturesMusic &\u00a0TheatrePhilosophy\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.Contact UsNeed Help?FacebookFacebookTwitterTwitterInstagramInstagramReport an accessibility issueReport a broken link on this pageTitle IXPrivacy PolicyCalifornia State University, Chico400 West First StreetChico, CA 95929Copyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n",
