Examples are provided below. Do not reply to these emails or click on the links. \nUnsolicited job offers are likely to be scams, especially if they\u2019re offering to pay $150+/hour. Do not reply to this email and be cautious of requests for your personal information.\nIf you clicked on a link and provided your credentials you should use Account Center (via the Portal) to reset your password.\nISEC was able to remove scam emails from campus mailboxes, and the links used have been reclassified as phishing and blocked on campus networks. Any campus accounts used to send these messages have had their passwords reset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Emergency Network Maintenance Posted on March 3, 2023 by admin\n\n\n\nDue to the network outage the campus experienced last Sunday night, emergency network maintenance is required to resume the redundancy for our internet connection from CENIC, our internet service provider. The emergency network maintenance will occur Saturday morning from 3:00 \u2013 4:00 AM. We do not anticipate any interruption of services, but if we do, it may impact some services or websites on or off campus like the learning management system, email, campus portal or internet access as a whole. We apologize for any interruptions this may cause, but it is imperative the emergency network maintenance occurs so we can avoid further internet service interruptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Network Refresh Project Posted on February 23, 2023February 23, 2023 by admin\n\n\n\nThe Division of IT will begin upgrading network ports in all state-supported buildings from February 27 \u2013 March 17.\u00a0The crew is working on an overnight schedule in an effort to avoid any network or power outages during normal operating hours.\u00a0 \u00a0\nA complete installation schedule for each building can be found here:\u00a0https://www.csuchico.edu/ccsv/projects/network-projects/network-refresh-project.shtml\u00a0\nThe campus community can look forward to internet connection speeds being 2.5 or 5x faster as well as more power for our electronic equipment.\u00a0If you experience any network issues during normal business hours, please submit a request at\u00a0support.csuchico.edu\u00a0or contact IT Support Services.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastPass LastPass Security Incident Posted on December 23, 2022 by admin\n\n\n\nLastPass may have notified you regarding a recent security incident involving unauthorized access to their environment. Please note that campus-managed LastPass accounts are not at risk. However, be very cautious of any phishing email message that asks you to provide information claiming they are from LastPass, especially if you are asked to provide your LastPass master password. LastPass personnel will never ask you to provide your LastPass master password and you should always carefully verify any webpage that asks for that information before providing it. Information Security and IT Support Services are actively monitoring this situation, and more information can be located at https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoicemail Voicemail Service Interruption Posted on December 21, 2022December 21, 2022 by admin\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Telecommunication Services has restored voicemail service and we do not anticipate further service interruption. The cause of the outage was an inadvertently disabled network adapter on the new voicemail server.\nSoon after the migration of the voicemail system was complete, the service became unavailable to users. Technicians are working on the issue with no estimated time for repair. Currently, calls are not being routed to voicemail, and voicemail messages cannot be retrieved. We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoicemail Voicemail Server Update Posted on December 14, 2022December 14, 2022 by admin\n\n\n\nScheduled Maintenance: Wednesday, December 21, 5:00 \u2013 8:00 AMServices Impacted: Voicemail\nOn Wednesday, December 21st Telecommunications Services will update the campus voicemail system. The new voicemail server updates aging hardware and meets Microsoft\u2019s requirements for OAuth. During this process voicemail messages, greetings, and configurations, will be migrated from the old to the new server. Voicemail will be unavailable during this migration. An announcement greeting will be in place during the migration informing callers of the outage. Users are encouraged to delete any unnecessary voicemails prior to Dec. 21st.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail Check for Missing Emails Posted on December 8, 2022 by admin\n\n\n\nOffice 365 sorts emails differently than Gmail. Here are a couple of tips to make sure you don\u2019t miss any important emails.\nJunk Email\nThe Office 365 system handles spam emails a little differently than Gmail. Both systems have robust spam filtering, but specific rules for what qualifies as spam may differ and we recommend checking for messages incorrectly marked as spam. Office 365 moves messages identified as spam to the Junk Email folder in your mailbox. If you find a message in Junk Email that was misidentified you can mark it as Not Junk to move it to your Inbox.\nIT regularly reviews Spam filtering rules to avoid misidentifying campus emails as spam. Please report misidentified emails to ITSS.\nFocused Inbox\nOutlook on the web has a feature called Focused inbox for emails determined to be important. Other emails will show up in the Other inbox located next to Focused. If you\u2019d like to have all emails in one place you can turn this feature off.\nMore information about Office 365 and these features is available at https://support.csuchico.edu/TDClient/1984/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=10591.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncategorized E-Mail Migration Posted on December 6, 2022December 8, 2022 by admin\n\n\n\nThe e-mail migration from Gmail was completed on November 21 and all campus e-mail is now available in Office 365. Overall, the transition has been successful given the magnitude and scope. We migrated 81,000 email accounts with little to no glitches in a couple of days. However, we want to acknowledge that there have been some challenges with the migration that we have been working through with students. ITSS has received calls from students that missed the communications and have been unable to access/log in to their new Office 365 account. We have been able to quickly respond with assistance and continue to be available to help with resolving outstanding issues.\nIf students are having trouble accessing their email they can go to\u00a0www.csuchico.edu,\u00a0click on EMAIL at the top of the page, and enter their new @csuchico.edu email address (username@csuchico.edu). Many students have had to be reminded to use their new @csuchico.edu email address for signing in instead of their old Gmail address (username@mail.csuchico.edu).\nAnother common issue we encountered is with students who are also employees on campus. Combining their student mailbox with their employee mailbox will require some additional organization of their email inbox using inbox rules to help separate your work emails from your school emails. Here are some tips to help you to manage email messages by using rules.\u00a0This could be useful for having course or student group related messages sorted into specific folders.\u00a0This 2-minute video on how to create custom rules in Outlook would also walk you through the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID Cards GET Issues, MLIB Printing Posted on December 6, 2022December 8, 2022 by admin\n\n\n\nUPDATE: This issue has been resolved.\nGET authentication is down and students can\u2019t load money on their cards. ITSS Go Print stations in MLIB 116, MLIB 229, MLIB 450, & THMA 131 have been set to free printing until the issue can be resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualtrics Qualtrics Digital User Forum Posted on December 5, 2022 by admin\n\n\n\nThe\u00a0Qualtrics Digital User Forum\u00a0will be held on December 14th at 10:00 AM PST.The Qualtrics Digital User Forum is a quarterly free event designed to help attendees grow their XM skillset, and learn about the latest Qualtrics product innovations and industry best practices, all while connecting with fellow XM professionals.\nAttendees will be able to choose from 3 different expert-led breakout sessions.\u00a0All available breakout sessions can be found here. There will also be time at the end to ask 1:1 questions to Qualtrics Subject Matter Experts.\nHere\u2019s a snippet of some key features and skills platform experts will be going through:\n\nSurvey Overview | Best practices for survey methodology & more\nDashboards Fundamentals | Creating visualizations, best practice reports & more\nText iQ + StatsiQ | Overview of functionality, use case, product demo & more\n\nSecure your free spot at the\u00a0Qualtrics Digital User Forum\u00a0or contact Lauri Henry at ljhenry@csuchico.edu for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosts navigation\nOlder posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by WordPress\n ~ \n\t\t\t\tTheme: Satellite by WordPress.com.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
