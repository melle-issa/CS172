Engineers from iSpace say the lander was low on fuel and in freefall for the last few hundred meters of its descent, suggesting that it almost certainly crashed. Most likely, the lander\u2019s wreckage now lies at the bottom of the 1.25-mile-deep Atlas Crater, which its pair of small rovers were supposed to explore.The loss makes iSpace the second company to crash-land on the Moon, following the Israel-based Beresheet spacecraft, which dumped a cargo of tardigrades in Mare Serenitatis in 2020. Both crashes underscore a harsh reality: landing on the Moon is still difficult, even more than fifty years after the Apollo missions.Takeshi Hakamada, CEO of Japanese firm ispace, bows after explaining that the communication of the Hakuto-R Mission 1 lander developed by ispace has been cut off, in Tokyo on April 26, 2023.

But what happens if a future commercial lander crashes into the Apollo 11 LEM, destroys the Apollo 17 rover, or slams down atop the Luna 2 wreckage?Archaeological Sites on the Moon\u201cThe Apollo sites will always be the first places humans set foot somewhere other than our home planet,\u201d Chapman University archaeologist Justin Walsh tells Inverse. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of a more significant development than that. It will be important to our descendants to understand what that was like, how it happened, what the experience of those humans was, and how they had to operate in this new context.\u201dSome of that knowledge can only come from eventually studying the places they walked and the things they left behind. Most of the Apollo astronauts left behind memoirs and official logs, but physical objects often record details that don\u2019t make it into the written record. The lunar landing sites are archaeological sites.For now, they\u2019re in exactly the same condition the astronauts left them in \u2014 except for weathering from UV radiation and micrometeorites.\u201cBut their only protection right now is the fact that we have not tried to go back to them yet,\u201d says Walsh.Protecting the Final FrontierNo one currently has a mission in the works to any of the Apollo, Luna, or Ranger landing sites, but archaeologists like Walsh, Beth O\u2019Leary at New Mexico State University, and Alice Gorman at Flinders University in Australia, along with organizations like For All Moonkind, argue that it\u2019s important to have some legal protections for the sites before that happens.\u201cWe know that the unofficial motto of New Space companies is \u201cmove fast and break things,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cWe really want to avoid that outcome when we\u2019re talking about pristine heritage sites that we don\u2019t even know how to approach properly yet.\u201dNASA has issued a detailed set of guidelines advising everyone to steer clear of the sites. Those guidelines include \u201chard \u2018keep out\u2019 boundaries\u201d of 75 meters for Apollo 11 and 225 meters for Apollo 17. And iSpace\u2019s recent lander crash makes it clear why NASA recommends such a wide berth; landing on the Moon is hard, and things can still go wrong.But there\u2019s nothing NASA can do to enforce those guidelines. They\u2019re basically a request.The actual objects on the Moon, like lunar rovers or the discarded items Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin left behind, remain the property of their original owners. So if a future Moon lander were to miss its mark and damage the descent stage of the Lunar Module, NASA could sue the space agency or company responsible. (But the damage would still be done. An irreplaceable piece of human history would be demolished.)\u201cThe only protection that any items in space have is that they continue to be the property of their owner. The landscape (or orbital environment, or whatever) cannot receive even this protection,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cTo use the example of Tranquility Base, the US government still owns all the items left there in 1969, but the site, including whatever survives of the footprints, is not protected.\u201dThat means someone could set a lander down right on top of the Apollo 15 rover tracks \u2014 the first vehicle tracks on the Moon \u2014 and nobody on Earth could do more than give them a dirty look.None of the laws that can protect important historic or cultural sites here on Earth apply in space, and Walsh, along with O\u2019Leary and others, say that needs to change before anyone gets around to trying to park next to the Apollo 17 rover.\u201cWe need an international treaty that specifically addresses heritage in space,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cThere are similar treaties that exist for international contexts on Earth, such as the Antarctic Treaty and its addenda and the 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage, which we can use as models. We don\u2019t have to start from scratch.\u201dmore like thisSpaceArtemis Moon Missions Are Still a Priority in NASA's Latest BudgetSpaceA Tiny Nearby Galaxy Has More Planet-Building Potential Than We ThoughtSpaceUltraviolet Light Produces A Toxic Gas in This Planet's Hellish AtmosphereLEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAYSubscribe for free to Inverse\u2019s award-winning daily newsletter!SubmitBy subscribing to this BDG newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy PolicySubscribe to our newsletter >Related TagsAstronomySpace SciencesearchEntertainmentCultureTVMoviesReviewsMarvelStreaming RecsSee AllGamingNewsReviewsGuidesSee AllGearNewsReviewsGuidesSee AllInnovationTechnologyScienceSustainabilitySpaceTransportation + EVsSee AllMind + BodyFitnessNutritionLongevityMental HealthSee AllAmplifying Our VoicesNewsletterAbout UsMastheadArchiveAdvertiseTermsPrivacyDMCAYour Privacy Options\u00a9 2023 BDG Media, Inc.
