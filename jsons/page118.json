The Content Localization Foundations project was the team\u2019s first efforts to onboard contributors who speak other languages and translate content into different locales.\nOver the course of 5 months, 28 volunteers created 36 pieces of localized content across 10 locales. Additionally, volunteers translated some of the Training Team\u2019s handbook pages related to content translation into 5 locales.\nThe project achieved some of the objectives initially laid out. Many points were learned that would improve the entry to localizing content on Learn.WordPress.orgWordPress.org The community site where WordPress code is created and shared by the users. This is where you can download the source code for WordPress core, plugins and themes as well as the central location for community conversations and organization.  https://wordpress.org/. Some necessary changes for the Locale Ambassador role were also identified. The team will continue to iterate on content localization processes to respond to these findings.\nProject Achievements\nThe following are what this project achieved in its six month duration from November 2022 to April 2023.\nContent Translation\n\nGoal: Translate 10 priority learning content into each target language (Inclusive of Lesson Plans, and Tutorials)\n\nCompleted: The team translated the following pieces of content:\nLocalePublished contentTranslations waiting reviewTranslated handbook pagesProject contributorsArabic1 Lesson Plan\u2013\u20132French1 Tutorial\u201322Greek\u20139 Tutorials\u20132Gujarati4 Lesson Plans, 1 Tutorial\u2013145Hindi6 Lesson Plans\u201324Indonesian1 Lesson Plan, 2 Tutorial\u2013\u20133Italian2 Lesson Plans1 Lesson Plan53Japanese1 Online Workshop\u2013\u20133Khmer\u20131 Lesson Plan\u20131Tamil6 Lesson Plans\u201323Total20 Lesson Plans,4 Tutorials,1 Online Workshop2 Lesson Plans, 9 Tutorials2528Number of content translated, by localeLearnings: The project wasn\u2019t able to translate 10 pieces of content in any one language.\nPart way through, the project recognized the process of translating a Tutorial (recording and editing a video) was more involved than most translators were able to contribute to. The project changed priorities to translating Tutorial subtitles instead, but not early enough to reach the goal of \u201c10 pieces of translated content\u201d in any locale.\nNext steps: Continue translating content in different locales, but focus on text-based content as a priority.\nOnboarding and Documentation\n\nGoal: Create a workflow of onboarding and how-to guides that take folks through the journey of joining the Training Team to publishing localized content\n\nCompleted: The team published a Content Translator onboarding path within the general Getting Started onboarding program. We now also have multiple resources in the handbook about publishing localized content, including Content Localization, Translating Subtitles, and Locale Ambassador.\nLearnings: Feedback was provided on how it was difficult for many contributors to track translation items in GitHubGitHub GitHub is a website that offers online implementation of git repositories that can easily be shared, copied and modified by other developers. Public repositories are free to host, private repositories require a paid subscription. GitHub introduced the concept of the \u2018pull request\u2019 where code changes done in branches by contributors can be reviewed and discussed before being merged be the repository owner.  https://github.com/ amongst other content creation issues.\nAdditionally, we received mixed feedback regarding using GitHub to manage translations. In general, those with experience using GitHub found the documented processes easy to follow. At the same time, others with little/no experience using GitHub showed hesitation to getting involved.\u00a0\nNext steps: To make tracking issues easier, we can move content localization issues into their own GitHub project board.\nAs for the perceived difficulties of GitHub itself, we can either improve the current onboarding to provide more assistance, or the team can consider using a different tool to manage translations (such as translation plugins, or Computer Assisted Translation tools). This is something the team will investigate further.\n\nGoal: Bring in at least two new Training Team Members from the following locale communities: Spanish, Japanese, German, French, and Italian\n\nResults: The project had 28 contributors across 10 locales that contributed to publishing content.\nLearnings: The project was able to bring in project contributors from 3 of the 5 most used WordPress locales. WordCampWordCamp WordCamps are casual, locally-organized conferences covering everything related to WordPress. They're one of the places where the WordPress community comes together to teach one another what they\u2019ve learned throughout the year and share the joy. Learn more. Asia was a good onboarding opportunity, where we saw multiple contributors from other locales join the project. Many contributors joined either through the Contributor DayContributor Day Contributor Days are standalone days, frequently held before or after WordCamps but they can also happen at any time. They are events where people get together to work on various areas of https://make.wordpress.org/ There are many teams that people can participate in, each with a different focus. https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/contributor-day/ https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/getting-started/getting-started-at-a-contributor-day/. event or after hearing a presentation from @bsanevans on the Training Team\u2019s localization efforts. (View slides here.)\nNext steps: These results encourage the Training Team to continue having a presence at different events \u2013 especially WordCamps and Contributor Days \u2013 where the team can present the need for content localization to different communities.\nEnlisting Locale Ambassadors\n\nGoal: Establish the Locale Ambassador role. Enlist at least five Locale Ambassadors.\n\nCompleted: The Locale Ambassador handbook page was published. 6 contributors (in 5 locales) volunteered to be Locale Ambassadors for this project. Of these, 2 locales were able to publish content.\nNotably, @piermario and @margheweb did a fantastic job as Italian Locale Ambassadors. They actively onboarded contributors and translation reviewers. They also represented the Training Team at Contributor Day at WordCamp Torino, leading a table focused on translating content for Learn.WordPress.org.\u00a0\nLearnings: The project received the following feedback about the Locale Ambassador role:\nSome are hesitant at joining the role as its definition includes a broad range of responsibilities. (\u200b\u200bA Locale Ambassador is someone who bridges their local community and the Training Team through various initiatives such as, but not limited to: bringing contributors into the Training Team, onboarding contributors to the Training Team\u2019s processes and providing language support, creating localized content.)\nSome would become a Locale Ambassador if they weren\u2019t alone in the role in their locale.\nCurrently, Locale Ambassadors continue to rely on Faculty Administrators to triage GitHub issues or provide translators with website access, causing a bottleneck in the translation process.\nNext steps: The project suggests renewing the Locale Ambassador role in the following ways:\nRenaming the role to \u201cTranslation Coordinators\u201d to better describe the main focus of the role.\nPositioning \u201cTranslation Coordinators\u201d as a fifth role in the Faculty Program.\nWhile this adds a vetting process to joining the role, it will provide the role with the same GitHub/website access as Faculty Administrators, empowering them to conduct the various tasks that currently rely on an Administrator to perform.\nIt will also connect Translation Coordinators with others already in the Faculty program, providing better support.\n\nWebsite Development\n\nGoal: Enable locale tagging for Courses, Tutorials, and Online Workshops\n\nCompleted: https://github.com/WordPress/Learn/pull/1030\n\nGoal: Have localized content show first on the Learn WordPress homepage when someone visits the page in their native locale\n\nCompleted: Localized Tutorials show on the homepage when viewed in a locale that has one.\nNext steps\nWhile this project will now be closed, the need to localize content on Learn.\u200b\u200bWordPress.org continues. The project suggests the Training Team continue to iterate on the content localization process, starting with these points:\nRenew the Locale Ambassador role as a fifth Faculty role: \u201cTranslation Coordinators\u201d.\nFocus localization efforts on text-based content.\nCreate a dedicated project board within the team\u2019s GitHub repository to track content localization.\nContinue raising awareness of the localization needs of Learn.WordPress.org at events.\nThank you to the following contributors who were involved in publishing localized content during this project: @piyopiyofox @webtechpooja @nadaelsharkawy @jdy68 @wplmillet @eboxnet @kosakkas @sagarladani @vanpariyar @baroliyamayur @amitpatelmd @viralmehta @piyushmultidots @pitamdey @askaryabbas @piermario @lidialab @margheweb @ardianimaya @kharisblank @fikekomala @megane9988 @vannkorn @karthickmurugan @dhanendran @kaderibrahim Aymenboch\nThanks also to @webtechpooja @courtneypk @meaganhanes who contributed to this post.\n#localizationLogin to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSyeda Sanjida Afrin\n\n2:40 am on April 29, 2023 \n\n\n\nTags: learn-wordpress ( 96 ), meeting recap ( 35 ), training ( 205 ), Training-team ( 109 ) \u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\nTraining Team Meeting Recap for April 11, 2023\n\n\nThis meeting followed this meeting agenda post.

Custom GutenbergGutenberg The Gutenberg project is the new Editor Interface for WordPress. The editor improves the process and experience of creating new content, making writing rich content much simpler. It uses \u2018blocks\u2019 to add richness rather than shortcodes, custom HTML etc. https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/ blockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. development\nProposing custom Gutenberg blocks for meeting recap notes, faculty meetings, onboarding posts, etc. This will help to speed up adding/editing the content part.\nThe idea is to give the simplest user interface for adding required data for meeting recap notes, agenda posts, etc in no time. This will also encourage new contributors to create and work on posts.\n\n\n2. Adding SEO MetaMeta Meta is a term that refers to the inside workings of a group. For us, this is the team that works on internal WordPress sites like WordCamp Central and Make WordPress. fields.\nCoordinating with codebase team members and adding meta fields for every post and page for training and learn websites.\nThis feature is going to be completely customizable without utilizing any plugins.\n3. Adding language switcher menu for translated pages/posts.\nSetting up and enabling language switcher options somewhere in headerHeader The header of your site is typically the first thing people will experience. The masthead or header art located across the top of your page is part of the look and feel of your website. It can influence a visitor\u2019s opinion about your content and you/ your organization\u2019s brand. It may also look different on different screen sizes. and footer navigation for learn and training websites. This will help to map same content with their language variations.\nThis will enable quicker navigation and engage users to find quickly what they are looking for.\nLogin to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEstela Rueda\n\n10:38 am on April 17, 2023 \n\n\n\nTags: make.wordpress.org/docs ( 9 ), p2-xpost ( 69 ) \u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\nX-post: Integrating the Mobile app documentation into HelpHub\n\n\nX-post from +make.wordpress.org/docs: Integrating the Mobile app documentation into HelpHubLogin to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBenjamin Evans\n\n12:28 am on April 17, 2023 \n\n\n\nTags: make.wordpress.org/project, p2-xpost ( 69 ) \u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\nX-post: Building Blocks: The Evolution of WordPress 2013-2023\n\n\nX-comment from +make.wordpress.org/project: Comment on Building Blocks: The Evolution of WordPress 2013-2023Login to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMumtahina Faguni\n\n3:05 am on April 11, 2023 \n\n\n\nTags: learn-wordpress ( 96 ), training ( 205 ), Training-team ( 109 ) \u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\nTraining Team Meeting Recap for April 4, 2023\n\n\nThis meeting followed this meeting agenda post.

Team reps are considering how we can streamline this better.\nHere are two ideas we\u2019ve had:\nPost an agenda in GitHubGitHub GitHub is a website that offers online implementation of git repositories that can easily be shared, copied and modified by other developers. Public repositories are free to host, private repositories require a paid subscription. GitHub introduced the concept of the \u2018pull request\u2019 where code changes done in branches by contributors can be reviewed and discussed before being merged be the repository owner.  https://github.com/, and publish a recap as a blog post. (This will reduce the number of posts on the blog, too, potentially making it easier to follow the information that gets published there.).\nPublishing a detailed agenda on the blog, and writing notable discussions in the comments of the post.\n\nRegarding the above two options, @webtechpooja, @sumitsingh & @courtneypk voted for option 1(idea 1).\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f\u00a0New team update\nEach month, Training Team reps publish an update to the entire WordPress project about the progress the team made in the last month.
