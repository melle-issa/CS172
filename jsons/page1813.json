And what we know is that diversity is beautiful.\u201d\nThis keynote speech is just one of the many ways that Yeh, Ph.D. and\n          Chapman\n          University assistant professor in the Attallah College of Education, has advanced the movement to battle\n          inequalities in education. Her primary vehicle for change: math. Why math? \u201cBecause\n          mathematics holds power,\u201d Yeh says.\n        \nWhen we think back to our own school days, who do we remember as the smart\n          kids? Most likely they\u2019re the elite few who did the best in math. Yeh points out that high achievement in\n          mathematics sets students on a course for success in academics and in life.\n\u201cMath is power. Math carries status,\u201d says Yeh. \u201cWe have to shift the way\n          we\n          teach it so every child can see how brilliant they are.\u201d\n        \nBut Yeh noticed that powerful math experiences were not available to many\n          students, disproportionately leaving out under-resourced communities, non-native English speakers and students\n          with disabilities, for example.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\"Math is power. Math carries status.\"\n+\n\"We have to shift the way we teach it so every child can see how\n        brilliant they are.\"\n      \n\n\n\n\u201cSchools are more segregated than ever,\u201d says Yeh, who taught elementary,\n          dual-language classrooms in the Los Angeles urban core for 10 years. During that period she made over 300 home\n          visits to immerse herself in the community and engage parents and guardians.\n        \nIn classrooms, students are often assigned labels \u2014 high, low, smart,\n          struggling. The labels teachers assign to students, Yeh explains, affect student achievement more than any\n          other teacher-student interaction factors in education.\nTo address this inequality, Yeh designed a new math methods course for\n          graduate students in the Attallah College of Educational Studies Teacher Education Program. Thanks to the\n          support of\n          Chapman\u2019s Pedagogical Innovations Grant, the program involves a hands-on, community-based component\n          taking Chapman students into local K-12 classrooms. Combined with scholarly research done in close\n          collaboration with Yeh, the program is designed for maximum impact.\n\u201cIn traditional math methods courses in teacher education programs, students\n          learn about the math content, children\u2019s mathematics thinking and how to teach\u2014all at the university,\u201d\n          explains Yeh. \u201cOur Chapman graduate students have opportunities to learn how to teach mathematics in school\n          classrooms,\n          with teachers and with groups of students. This kind of authentic learning will have a larger impact on our\n          students and in our local schools.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n+ Student Ambassadors\nCathery Yeh\u2019s community-based teaching program will expand to include\n            undergraduates starting in 2020, but graduate students are already thriving in the program, often having\n            opportunities to co-publish and present on research together with faculty. \n\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on a student\u2019s headshot to read their story\n\n\nBrande Otis (M.A. \u201918)\nco-published an article with Yeh entitled \u201cMathematics for Whom: Reframing and Humanizing Mathematics.\u201d\n\nOtis says: \u201cAt Chapman, my major focus was equity in education and understanding how power gets\n              transmitted in various ways in schools. I am also interested in understanding the role of positive Black\n              identity in the academic trajectories of young Black people. \nI reached out to Dr. Yeh because I was interested in her work around mathematics curriculum and social\n              justice, and I wanted to explore how curriculum could be used as a tool to maintain power and privilege.\n              I\n              interned in local schools, where I worked closely with teachers around supporting students with IEPs,\n              behavior plans and meeting the needs of young students. I saw rather closely the ways in which\n              anti-Blackness, power and privilege permeated into the Special Education system, and in curriculum. \nWorking with Dr. Yeh and the classroom teachers, I was exposed to the ways we might challenge dominant\n              power narratives in schools, and work towards incorporating student experience, voice and perspective in\n              the ways we teach and understand mathematics. I was a witness to the power of inclusive and engaging\n              pedagogical practices when working with students of color. \nAdditionally, Dr. Yeh and I collaborated on a research study on word problems from 3rd and 5th grade\n              math\n              textbooks. Using critical theory, we examined the ways in which word problems might communicate dominant\n              narratives about who students were \u2018supposed\u2019 to be, and who they were \u2018presumed\u2019 to be, particularly in\n              mathematics. Through my work in the program, I understood how to better perform ethical and responsive\n              research.\u201d\nOtis is continuing her studies in equity in education as a Ph.D. student at UCLA.\n\n\nAnsley Wong (M.A. \u201919)\nwas recently awarded a Fulbright teaching fellowship and will be spreading the math movement\n              internationally.\nWong and Yeh will soon publish the journal article \u201cTeaching for Excellence and Equity in Mathematics,\u201d\n              on language and learning in bilingual math classrooms. \nThe professor and student also paired up to present on culturally and linguistically responsive\n              teaching pedagogies at the California Mathematics Council-South national education conference to more\n              than 3,000 attendees. \n\u201cEmpowering students in mathematics is so important in today\u2019s society,\u201d says Wong. \u201cMy experiences at\n              Chapman have allowed me to look at teaching through a different lens.\u201d \n\n\nLufei Lin\nan international student in the program, led a webinar on WeChat, the most popular social media\n              platform\n              in\n              China. \u201cMy presentation started with this question: What does it mean to be good at math? The main part\n              of\n              the presentation was about the tools I used in the classroom. It is so fun to share what I learned, and\n              it\n              helps me reflect on my learning,\u201d says Lin.\nThe main part of his presentation (which was in Chinese) was on mathematics practice standards in the\n              United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe foundational element of the methods course is designing what Yeh\n          describes\n          as \u201crich mathematical experiences\u201d that leverage the knowledge base of all students, regardless of background,\n          English language proficiency or ability status. The instruction is grounded in problem solving, reasoning,\n          play,\n          and, what Yeh argues is most important, real-world application.\n        \nThe math methods course builds on Yeh\u2019s research in special education. She\n          and\n          her co-principal investigator, Trisha Sugita, Ph.D., received Chapman\u2019s Faculty Opportunity Grant to pioneer\n          and\n          conduct a preliminary evaluation of a technology-facilitated model to improve special education math\n          instruction. \nOften special education teachers are given the district math textbook and\n          told\n          to teach students with a wide range of ability. \u201cThe teachers tell me they can\u2019t use the textbook because it\n          doesn\u2019t meet anyone\u2019s needs,\u201d says Yeh.\nThe research team meets monthly with these teachers and co-teach in their\n          classrooms,\n          looking at the existing curriculum and building learning experiences based on the children\u2019s\n          current understanding.\n        \nAs an illustration, Yeh mentions Jason, 4, from one of these classrooms. One\n          day, his teacher notices that Jason has neatly arranged the peas on his lunch plate in what look like 10\n          frames,\n          a visual model for learning basic math facts. \nJason points to the peas, beaming proudly, and says, \u201cI made a group of 10\n          and\n          a group of\n          three. And it\u2019s 13.\u201d The teacher praises him for showing his math understanding. This could be chalked up to\n          just another precocious share-worthy moment, but it\u2019s noteworthy that Jason is diagnosed with autism and ADHD\n          and is in a self-contained special education classroom.\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+\nAt Salk Elementary School, graduate student Maribel Barrios, top, asks,\n            \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite place to visit in your local community?\u201d She uses this real-world scenario to teach\n            about gathering data and creating graphs to represent data.\nGraduate student Marissa Fierro, bottom, demonstrates a STEAM (Science,\n            Technology, Engineering, Art, Math) activity incorporating basic counting skills with explorations on\n            density\n            and mass. The question: How much weight can aluminum-foil boats float?\n\n\n\n\n\nYeh mentions another child who, for the first time in six years, is adding\n          and\n          subtracting using the tools and methods from this program. \u201cSome of these students classified with a\n          disability\n          are outperforming their mainstream counterparts in math,\u201d Yeh reports.\n        \nIn 2017, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), the world\u2019s\n          largest math education organization, published Yeh\u2019s book, \u201cReimagining the Mathematics Classroom.\u201d In it, she\n          conveys the need for changing the way math is taught, building knowledge on what students already know rather\n          than disenfranchising large swaths of students with rote learning that\u2019s disconnected from the real world.\nAfter the book held 18 months on its bestseller list, NCTM asked Yeh to join\n          the writing team of mathematics education leaders to write a new book titled \u201cCatalyzing Change.\u201d For this\n          book,\n          Yeh is collaborating with colleagues across three different universities to share\n          research outcomes and provide schools and districts with proven models and methods to\n          put into practice.\n        \n\u201cClassroom instruction shouldn\u2019t be designed to get students to only engage\n          in\n          rote calculations \u2013 there are calculators to do that,\u201d says Yeh. \u201cRote memorization isn\u2019t enough anymore.\u201d\nRather, the new generation of math students should be problem solvers,\n          critical\n          thinkers, and active participants in a diverse democracy \u2013 ready to use mathematics as a tool to make sense of\n          our world\u2019s pressing problems and create change, she says. \u201cWe need a paradigm shift. Every child can problem\n          solve. How can we support teachers in changing their classroom environment to build on each student\u2019s\n          strengths?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch 4-year-old Jason show his math understanding\n\n\n\n\n\u00f7\nAnd the movement lives on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+Chapman\u2019s math methods course culminates in a Community Math\n            Night, where smiling children and their parents eagerly \u201cdo math\u201d through fun group activities and games grounded in\n            problem solving, reasoning and real world application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountering Deficit Myths of Students...\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Jason in Action\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncathery yeh forward2019-09 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCar Still Drives Transportation Thinking\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Dreams Bold Vision\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumna Implements Sustainability at Happiest Place on Earth A Chapman University alumna is helping Disneyland Resort meet its ambitious goal of sending zero waste to landfills by 2030.
