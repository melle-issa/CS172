The Chapman Fund is the university\u2019s most versatile fund, providing scholarships and student enrichment through out-of-the-classroom experiences and research opportunities.\nMaking a Collective Impact\n\u201cGiving Day is a celebration of the Chapman Family,\u201d says Jen DeGrave, assistant vice president of annual giving. \u201cA contribution of any size is truly valued, as all gifts make an impact on our university and community.\u201d\nTo build momentum for Giving Day participation, Chapman has recruited influencers from among the Chapman Family to help spread the word on social media.\nSteven Babiak \u201915 is grateful for the opportunity to support Chapman as a Giving Day influencer.\n\u201cChapman was where I truly found myself and developed into the person I am proud to be today. The relationships I built and the experiences I gained here serve every facet of my life,\u201d he says.\u00a0\n\u201cAs an alumnus, the Chapman University community continues to be a home for me \u2013 a place where I feel connected, cherished and cared for, and now a community where I can give something back to the place that gave me everything. Supporting the Chapman Fund means that I can play a part in creating the same kind of transformative experience for current and future Panthers.\u201d\nChapman\u2019s annual Giving Day has raised millions for the Chapman Fund since its debut in 2019, and it has been named one of the top five charity events in Orange County. During the pandemic, Giving Day donations provided vital funds for students who were impacted financially. This year, organizers expect more robust participation than ever, with several matching donors lined up to help maximize the event\u2019s overall impact.\u00a0\nVisit the Giving Day website for more information and learn how you can immediately impact student scholarships and extraordinary experiences at Chapman.\n\n\n\nChapman Experience Chapman Fund donors financial aid Giving Day scholarships \n\n\n\n\n \n\nStaci Dumoski \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurel Tamayo \u201921 Inspires Climate-Friendly Action Through Film\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Student Takes on Professor in Viral TikTok Challenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership That Spans the Campus Jack of all trades Kyle Tanimura is leaving quite the lasting mark on Chapman, where he has taken on multiple leadership roles as a double major in political science and strategic and corporate communication, with a...\n\n\nMay 1, 2023 Jennifer Winfield\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Pacific Islander Desi American Heritage Month Events at Chapman University Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Heritage Month, which runs from May 1 to 31, celebrates the identities, histories and experiences of the APIDA community.
