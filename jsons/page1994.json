(Photo Courtesy of ASI) \nHunter Schafer said she remembers the first time she saw a transgender character on television.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s magic when you haven\u2019t seen someone like you on the screen your whole life, and then all of a sudden, there it is,\u201d said Schafer.\u00a0\n\nTo a sold-out crowd of 700 students, faculty and staff, Schafer humbly described herself as a \u201cpastor\u2019s daughter from North Carolina.\u201d But she\u2019s also known as an artist, LGBTQ rights advocate and breakout actress from HBO\u2019s award-winning show, \u201cEuphoria.\u201d\u00a0\nThe young star spoke to the Cal State Fullerton community as part of the \u201cBeyond the Conversation\u201d speaker series hosted by Associated Students Inc. and the Division of Student Affairs. The series invites a diverse lineup of speakers to campus to engage students in dialogue about diversity, equity and inclusion.\u00a0\nPrevious speakers included political activist Angela Davis, Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, actors Danny Trejo and Daniel Dae Kim, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones.\nExamining Trans Representation and \u2018Euphoria\u2019\u00a0\nA self-proclaimed \u201cfashion nerd,\u201d Schafer found success modeling in New York\u2019s fashion scene when she was 19. She decided to try her hand at acting after learning about the character Jules Vaughn in \u201cEuphoria.\u201d\nJules is a transgender girl who transfers to a new high school at the beginning of the show. Navigating the raw realities of love, loss and addiction, Schafer said her personal connection to the character was too strong to ignore.\u00a0\n\u201cEven before there was a pilot episode, the show felt visceral, and I could see what it was,\u201d said Schafer. \u201cI feel really lucky that I started out with Jules because she was basically like one or two steps away from who I was at the time.\u201d\u00a0\nA transgender woman herself, Schafer said that she worked with show creator Sam Levinson to create storylines and emotions that accurately captured what it\u2019s like to be a young student grappling with her sexuality and gender identity.\u00a0\n\u201cI think Sam really taught us how to develop our emotional intelligence and use our head spaces, the wounds of our past and our history, which he said are our superpowers, and bring them to the characters,\u201d Schafer explained.\nPouring herself into the role, Schafer said that Jules not only is relatable, but she also symbolizes a step in the right direction for transgender representation in film and television.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s so surreal because television is like this untouchable portal that\u2019s been there your whole life, ignoring you. And now, you\u2019re there. I hope that\u2019s the reaction that happens, particularly for the trans community,\u201d said Schafer.\nSince her television debut, Schafer has been busy with new acting projects. This year, she will appear on the big screen in Tilman Singer\u2019s horror film \u201cCuckoo\u201d and \u201cThe Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.\u201d\nAdvice for Future Artists and Entertainers\nBetween the fashion, entertainment and artistic industries, Schafer has had a lot of experience juggling responsibilities, deadlines and priorities.\u00a0\nFor students who feel overwhelmed with busy schedules, Schafer said it\u2019s important to develop routines. Although it may sound like \u201cboring adult stuff,\u201d she said habits like sleeping a good amount and working out help her stay focused and prepared for every new task.\u00a0\nAs a former visual arts student, Schafer explained the importance of dealing with rejection and criticism in healthy and constructive ways.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not receiving criticism, you\u2019re probably not doing something right. That\u2019s what art is for. It\u2019s about creating conversation. Not everyone is going to love it, and that\u2019s okay,\u201d she said.\u00a0\nIn addition to dealing with rejection, Schafer said it\u2019s crucial that artists not let outside voices and influences stop them from creating what their heart desires.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen you start turning your craft into a job, you\u2019re going to start thinking about how people are going to receive it and how certain elements of it are going to be profitable, and that can really kill your creative soul,\u201d said Schafer. \u201cThere\u2019s this pressure to make money and make a career out of it, but I think it\u2019s so much more important to stay tapped into who you are.\u201d\u00a0\nSchafer\u2019s full \u201cBeyond the Conversation\u201d talk can be found on Titan TV\u2019s Youtube channel.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\nDaniel Dae Kim on Asian American Experience: \u2018You Have to Make Your Own Room\u2019Danny Trejo Reveals Secret to Success: \u2018It\u2019s All About Helping People\u2019\u2018The 1619 Project\u2019 Author Reframes American History \n\n\n\nTags\nArtsCampus and CommunityDiversity Equity and InclusionEmpowermentStudentsEvents \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTaylor Arrey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttarrey@fullerton.edu\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse\n\nAll News\nTopics A-Z\nAthletics\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nCSUF Facts\nContact Media Relations\nFind an Expert\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nSubscribe / Download\n\nSubscribe to our eNewsletters\n\nSubmit a Story\nDo you have news you\u2019d like to share with the campus?\nSubmit Your Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site is maintained by Strategic Communications.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo report problems or comments, please contact strategiccomm@fullerton.edu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 California State University, Fullerton.
