The Block Editor allows developers to rapidly create theme templates, template parts, and all the various elements needed for a modern WordPress theme.\n\nThis course is Part 2 of the Developers Guide to Block Themes, which will cover more advanced block theme development tactics. Part 2 follows directly from Part 1 \u2013 Block Theme Development Fundamentals, so it\u2019s highly recommended that you complete that course first. \n\nIn this course, you will learn\u2026\n\nAdding custom fonts to your block theme\nAdding custom functionality through block patterns\nCreating Global Styles variations\nMaking your block theme translation ready\nLocking down your theme settings and blocks\n\n\nIn order to complete the exercises in this course, you will need a local WordPress development environment and a code editor. You will also need to have either WordPress version 6.1 installed, or version 6.0 with the Gutenberg plugin installed and active. You will also need a WordPress.org profile, whichwhich you can register for here if you don\u2019t already have one.\n\nReady to get started?
