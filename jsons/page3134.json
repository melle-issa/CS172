Participation in the competition helps students develop and practice their academic, presentation, and research communication skills. Presenting in the competition increases student\u2019s capacity to effectively explain their research in three minutes in a language appropriate to an audience unfamiliar with the topic.\n\n3MT celebrates excellent research, scholarship and creative works of graduate students.\n3MT cultivates students\u2019 academic, presentation, and research communication skills.\n3MT is a three-minute presentation with a single visual in a language appropriate to a non-specialist audience.\n\nWhy participate?\n\nSkills development for graduate students to present their research and scholarly activities.\nContributes to graduate student and scholarly culture at Chapman University.\nCash prizes are provided to the top presenters and a People's Choice award.\nThe first prize winner represents Chapman at the Western Association of Graduate Schools (WAGS) annual meeting with the chance to compete at the national Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) meeting thereafter.\n\nEligibility and rules:\n\nActive doctoral and master's students in any graduate degree program at Chapman are eligible to participate.\nA single static PowerPoint slide is permitted. No slide transitions, animations. No additional electronic media (e.g., sound and video files).\nNo additional props (e.g., costumes, musical instruments, laboratory equipment) are permitted.\nPresentations are limited to 3 minutes maximum.\nPresentations are to be spoken word (e.g., no poems, raps or songs).\n\nTips and resources:\n\nWear business attire.\nUse limited text on the PowerPoint slide.\nUse visuals such as charts, graphs, illustrations & photos.\nPractice, practice, and practice!\nTime yourself; keep it under 3 minutes (but not less than 2:40!).\nSpeak to your audience, make eye-contact, speak clearly and confidently.\nAvoid jargon: present your ideas in an accessible way.\nBe engaging: make the audience feel something.\nWatch other 3MT presentation videos\u00a0for guidance and inspiration.\nBe aware of the scoring rubric to help you prepare your presentation.\n\nComplete instructions for participation can be found at bit.ly/Chapman3MT.\u00a0\nSponsored by the Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                Graduate Student Achievements & Entry Database\n\n                                            \n\nChapman University's graduate and professional students distinguish themselves in the following ways:\n\nScholarly or creative works published\nPresentations at state, national, and international conferences\nExternal grant awards received\nHonors or awards received from professional associations or organizations external to Chapman\nRecognition and awards received at external festivals, juries, and competitions\u00a0\nRecognition or honors for scores received on professional licensure examinations\nParticipation in Chapman\u2019s 2022-2023 Three Minute Thesis competition\nNomination to represent their academic unit in the Spring 2023 Doti Awards competition.\n\nGraduate students\u00a0submit their outstanding achievements in the Graduate Achievement Submission System by completing the\u00a0Graduate Student Achievement submission form\u00a0(click the link or fill out in frame below).\nThis year\u2019s reporting period is June 1, 2022 - May 31, 2023 - all achievements/activities must have been earned/conducted\u00a0within these dates.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLoading\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                Graduate Student Scholarly/Creative Grants\n\n                                            \n\nConsistent with Chapman University's commitment to the scholarly and creative activity of its graduate students, Graduate Student Scholarly/Creative Activity Grants are offered through funding from the Vice Provost for Graduate Education.\u00a0If you are interested in applying for funding for a specific scholarly/creative activity you are undertaking independent of a class assignment (e.g. master\u2019s thesis, doctoral dissertation, research or creative publication, or other original research or creative work), please read the following.\u00a0\nThere are four graduate student grant types for which you might be eligible:\n\nTravel: Scholarly or creative activity preparation (funding that supports travel to undertake or carry out research or creative activity)\nTravel: Scholarly or creative activity dissemination (funding that supports sharing your work external to Chapman University)\nScholarly or creative activity financial support, non-travel (funding that supports the purchase of consumable research materials, data access, publication fees, or other non-travel related expenses)\nTravel: Conference, professional meeting or festival attendance only (funding that supports attendance at a specific event without the presentation of your scholarly/creative work)\n\nNote: priority for funding in 2022-23 will be given to the first three categories. Funding for \"attendance only\" travel awards will likely be extremely limited as we prioritize student supports for the resumption of preparation, dissemination, and non-travel research/creative endeavors after COVID-19's impacts from spring 2020 through summer 2021.\u00a0Many graduate students did not submit their scholarly or creative work for presentation in that timeframe or were precluded from conducting their studies or traveling to gather data, thus we anticipate there to be greater needs in the first three categories this academic year.\nYou may start an application in the online submission system, save it, and return to it later to finish. You should apply BEFORE incurring the expenses. Please be mindful of the timing of the expenses as all expenses must be incurred by May 31, 2023 for any grant given this academic year.\nIn addition to answering questions about your planned activity, you will need the following to supplemental materials complete your online application:\n\nA copy of your Chapman IRB or IACUC approval (or exemption) letter if your research involves human or animal subjects;\nProof of acceptance at conference/venue if applying for a dissemination grant;\nEmail address of faculty member to request a letter of support;\nA document that you compile that contains verification of estimated expenses for which you are requesting funding.\u00a0\n\nPlease read all instructions in the application carefully. Deadlines and financial terms are contained in the instructions.\u00a0Expenses submitted which do not comply with university and IRS rules will not be reimbursed. Additionally, funds received may be subject to tax; complete information is provided in instructions and award documents.\nPlease choose your college/school to access your application website:\n\n\n\n\nArgyros School\n\n\nAttallah College\n\n\nCrean College\n\n\n\n\nDodge College\n\n\nSchmid College\n\n\nSchool of Communication\n\n\n\n\nSchool of Pharmacy\n\n\nWilkinson College\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIf you encounter questions or problems as you complete your application, please email Lonnise Magallanez in the Vice Provost\u2019s office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                Graduate Student Awards\n\n                                            \n\nThe James L.
