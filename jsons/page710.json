While Zion was never interested in flying, he did his part to help out, getting up before dawn and working until dusk. He also raised sheep and tended to the family bulls.\n\u201cI was always involved with something. I never had downtime,\u201d he says.\nThis trend continued in college. At Chico State, Brigham has carried a full load, excelling academically, all while competing in national agriculture competitions and working full time as an assistant store manager at Tractor Supply Company. Prior to this, Brigham attended Merced Community College by day while working the night shift at a quarry.\n\u201cI\u2019m used to the overload,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be kind of weird graduating and only working next year.\u201d\nBrigham plans to continue working at Tractor Supply next year while his girlfriend completes her degree. But make no mistake\u2014this studious, methodical planner has big plans beyond that.\nFirst, he\u2019d like to work for the US Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) for a variety of reasons.\n\n\u201cI tell people that when I came to Chico it felt like going from a black and white TV to full color. The professors at Chico State really want to be involved and that\u2019s such a cool part of being here.\u201d\n Zion Brigham\n\u201cIt would be a great opportunity to gain some additional experience and work for a really cool organization. They might put you in Argentina, Vietnam, or wherever they have agricultural trade,\u201d Brigham explained. \u201cYou\u2019re talking to farmers, working with them, getting data for them, and helping them establish connections to the United States. That\u2019s where the data analysis becomes important, when doing trade negotiations.\u201d\nThinking even longer term, he\u2019d like to get a master\u2019s degree, a PhD, and eventually become a college professor.\nBrigham admits that his busy schedule has kept him from experiencing some of the special parts of Chico, including its outdoor and social scene. But he has taken full advantage of every opportunity the agricultural business department has to offer.\n\u201cI tell people that when I came to Chico it felt like going from a black and white TV to full color,\u201d Brigham said. \u201cThe professors at Chico State really want to be involved and that\u2019s such a cool part of being here.\u201d\nBrigham was part of Chico State\u2019s winning team\u2014both regionally and nationally\u2014at the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service Agricultural Export Market Challenge in March of 2022. He teamed up with Kurt Sheppard and Erin Hartley to strategize the best foreign market to implement a fictitious product called \u201cClean Burp\u201d into.\nIt was after that experience that Brigham set his sights on working for FAS.\n\u201cWe made a lot of connections,\u201d Brigham said. \u201cIt opened up my eyes to the great career opportunities\u00a0that the FAS offers, and personally,\u00a0it has changed my career plan for the better.\u201d\nNow a senior, ready to graduate in May, he is poised to get a first taste of downtime.\nWith it, he hopes to use some well-deserved days off to check a few more National Parks off the list, on his quest to visit each one.\n\n\nShare this Article\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tLuke Reid\t\t\n\n\n\t\tLuke Reid (History, '04; Kinesiology, '09) is a content producer for University Communications.\t\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular \n\n\t\t\t\t\tBusiness Double Major Ready for Life\u2019s Next Big Challenge\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tExpanded CalFresh Eligibility Brings Food Access to More Chico State Students\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWorth Sharing: Health Services Administration College Bowl Team Scores Wins\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLife of Hard Work Pays Off for Agricultural Business Major\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRooted in Connection: The Wildcat Family Tree\t\t\t\t\n\n\nSubscribe to Chico State Today\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tType your email\u2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nChico State Today is an official site of California State University, Chico.\nReport an accessibility issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChico State\n\n\n\nCalifornia State University, Chico\n400 West First Street\nChico, CA 95929\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose Subscribe Pop-Up\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tClose Subscribe Pop-Up\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
