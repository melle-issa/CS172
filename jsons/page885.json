Custom GutenbergGutenberg The Gutenberg project is the new Editor Interface for WordPress. The editor improves the process and experience of creating new content, making writing rich content much simpler. It uses \u2018blocks\u2019 to add richness rather than shortcodes, custom HTML etc. https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/ blockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. development\nProposing custom Gutenberg blocks for meeting recap notes, faculty meetings, onboarding posts, etc. This will help to speed up adding/editing the content part.\nThe idea is to give the simplest user interface for adding required data for meeting recap notes, agenda posts, etc in no time. This will also encourage new contributors to create and work on posts.\n\n\n2. Adding SEO MetaMeta Meta is a term that refers to the inside workings of a group.

Adding language switcher menu for translated pages/posts.\nSetting up and enabling language switcher options somewhere in headerHeader The header of your site is typically the first thing people will experience. The masthead or header art located across the top of your page is part of the look and feel of your website. It can influence a visitor\u2019s opinion about your content and you/ your organization\u2019s brand. It may also look different on different screen sizes. and footer navigation for learn and training websites. This will help to map same content with their language variations.\nThis will enable quicker navigation and engage users to find quickly what they are looking for.\nShare this:TwitterFacebookLogin to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAskary Abbas\n\n8:17 am on April 18, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nI would love to contribute to GutenbergGutenberg The Gutenberg project is the new Editor Interface for WordPress.

The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. patterns. Right now, we are using reusable blocks, which is also a good option.  I think we should reconsider creating a dedicated GutenbergGutenberg The Gutenberg project is the new Editor Interface for WordPress. The editor improves the process and experience of creating new content, making writing rich content much simpler.

That is super helpful too.\nI hope it will give you a more clear picture of what I am trying to say.\nAnd the other part of this project, the language switcher, I am quite excited to see this working.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment. \nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
