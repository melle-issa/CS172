The Moderna and Pfizer monovalent two dose primary series is no longer recommended for use in the United States and those who have never been vaccinated are now recommended to receive one bivalent dose instead of the discontinued two dose monovalent series. The CDC also recommends an additional bivalent dose for those 65 years and older and for those who are immunocompromised. For those students and employees who are currently compliant with the UC Vaccine Policy, no additional action is required as a result of these updated CDC recommendations. If you have questions about the updated recommendations please call or email Contact Tracing and Vaccine Navigation Services at 949-824-2300 or\u00a0contacttracing@uci.edu.\nAntigen Test Kits and Face Coverings\nAntigen test kits\u00a0and\u00a0face coverings\u00a0are available to all students,\u00a0faculty and staff.\n\nCampus Messages UCI Digest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\nUCI COVID Minute\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCI Minute: January 10, 2023 | Community Update on the Bivalent Booster for Children - UC Irvine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCI Minute: January 3, 2023 | Community Update on the COVID-19 Bivalent Booster Requirement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCI COVID Minute: May 27, 2022 - UC Irvine\n\n\n\n\nSee more UCI COVID-Minute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth and Safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation For\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\nUCI COVID-19 Response Center\n949-824-9918 | covid19@uci.edu\nReport\u00a0COVID-19 Case\u00a0or\u00a0COVID-19 Safety Concern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCI CARES Act\nEnvironmental Health & Safety COVID-19 Information\nHuman Resources COVID-19 Staff Resources\nUC COVID-19 Information\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of California, Irvine\nIrvine, CA 92697 949-824-5011 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9\u00a02023\u00a0UC\u00a0Regents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
