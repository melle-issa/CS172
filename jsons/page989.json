The collection is supported by an endowment established by the late Phyllis and Ross Escalette, and is comprised mostly of contemporary and modern paintings, prints, and sculpture. Rather than being housed in a museum or gallery, The Escalette Collection functions as a \"museum without walls\" where artwork is displayed throughout the Chapman campus in hallways, public spaces, and study areas. The collection is free and open to the public to view.\nCurrent Exhibitions:\n\n\n\n\nWE WERE THEN, WE ARE NOW \n10th Anniversary of TAB\n\n\nWE WERE THEN, WE ARE NOW\nRoosevelt Hall, 1st Floor\n\n\n\nThis exhibit opens the floor to contemporary indigenous artwork in the\u00a0Escalette Collection, and includes artists from the Akimel O\u2019odham, Chemehuevi, Cahuilla, and Tongva tribes. Through photography, painting, mixed media, printmaking, and collage, these artists share perspectives and experiences that will enlighten and strengthen our connections with one another. These pieces are for everyone to love, interpret, and learn from. Let us use this space as inspiration and come together to enjoy art with open minds and hearts. There is a story out there to be heard.\n\nVISIT THE VIRTUAL EXHIBITION\u00a0\n\nSCHEDULE A TOUR\n10 Years of TAB\nHenley Galleria, 2nd Floor of Argyros Forum\u00a0\nSeptember 9th, 2022 - Spring, 2023\n\n\n\nThis exhibition documents the evolution of\u00a0Tab:\u00a0The Journal of Poetry & Poetics\u00a0over the past 10 years. With volumes ranging from maps to newspapers to postcards,\u00a0Tab\u00a0uses design to explore ideas of time, space, and belonging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Section\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                Searching on eMuseum\n\n                                            \n\nThere are several ways to navigate our eMuseum website.\n\nOn the home Collections page, we have created groupings of objects that allow you to explore the collection by medium, new acquisitions, what's on view, and exhibition-related themes.\nAnother option is to use the left-hand menu. These icon buttons allow you to search by Collection, People (in our case, artists), Exhibitions, and MyCollections.\n\nCreating your own Collection is simple; just click on the folder icon on the left-hand menu and type in your collection name.
