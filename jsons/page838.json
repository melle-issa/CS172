The Stanford Parents\u2019 Program and the Parents\u2019 Club are among the organizations that give parents and guardians a chance to become more involved with the university.\nNew Student Orientation\nNew Student Orientation (NSO) is generally held in late September shortly before school begins. It includes events for parents and guardians, such as seminars and chances to meet university administrators. The pandemic changed plans last year.\nGenerally speaking, parents and guardians attending NSO are encouraged to wear comfortable clothing and shoes. Events involve much walking. Plus, although some residences have elevators, many do not. You may have to carry boxes of belongings up several flights of stairs. Temperatures are warm during the days\u201370s to 80s\u2013and cool in the evenings\u201340s to 50s. All parent and guardian programming is scheduled for only the first day of NSO. Parents and families are asked to bid farewell to their child in the late afternoon at residence hall events.\nInformation on orientation is generally included in Approaching Stanford. A schedule of NSO events is generally provided to parents or guardians and students when they arrive. Advance reservations for hotel rooms in the Palo Alto area are strongly advised.\nFamily Weekend\nFamily Weekend is generally held the last full weekend in February. Family members are advised tp wear comfortable clothing and shoes. Activities tends to involve a great deal of walking. The Palo Alto area in the winter is cool\u201340s and 50s\u2013and wet. Rain gear is advised. The fall issue of the Stanford Parents\u2019 Newsletter will provide details.\nStanford Parent and Family Engagement\nThe Stanford Parents\u2019 Program hosts receptions that bring university speakers to parents and guardians in their regions, organizes volunteers to help with events and fundraising and encourages parents and guardians to become part of the Stanford community. Visit the website.\nParents\u2019 Club of Stanford University\nThe Parents\u2019 Club builds community by supporting Stanford students and families. It is a not-for-profit organization that is separate from the university. Founded locally in 1924, the club today consists of parents and guardians from around the world. The club offers a range of programs that directly support students, provides information for parents and guardians via newsletters and general meetings, organizes social events and provides the university with volunteers at NSO, Family Weekend and Admit Weekend. Over the decades, the club has provided more than $1 million in scholarships for Stanford undergraduates.\nSignature programs include the Distinguished Speaker series, where a Stanford professor speaks on a topic of interest, the On-Campus Delivery service that enables loved ones to order bakery treats for delivery to their student\u2019s dorm and the Entertainment Extravaganza! showcase of student\u00a0performing groups that closes Family Weekend. All parents and guardians of Stanford students are welcome to join at\u00a0stanfordparentsclub.org/join. Membership is free of charge.\n\n\nPublications, Web Sites and Other Resources\nThe Parents and Guardians Newsletter is electronically mailed during the academic year to parents or guardians of undergraduate students.\nParents or guardians with questions can call the Help Line at (650) 725-0649 or send e-mail to mykidis@stanford.edu.\nStanford, the university\u2019s magazine, is sent to parents and guardians of matriculating undergraduates.\nFacebook users can become fans of Stanford to receive regular feeds of the most interesting news across campus.
