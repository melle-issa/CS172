He flew to London to research an\u00a0article pegged to the 50th anniversary of\u00a0Leigh\u2019s death.\n\u201cI found this incredibly rich resource, with\u00a0200 of Olivier\u2019s love letters to Vivien, and\u00a0correspondence with everyone from Elia\u00a0Kazan to Winston Churchill,\u201d Galloway\u00a0recalls. \u201cIt became clear that this was much\u00a0more than an article.\u201d\nSo Galloway dived into more than four years of research that took him, among other places, to India, where Leigh was born, and deep into the David O. Selznick Collection of memos and other Hollywood studio records archived at the University of Texas.\nThe result is \u201cTruly, Madly: Vivien Leigh, Laurence Olivier and the Romance of the Century,\u201d (Grand Central Publishing), released this spring, when it landed on The New York Times Best Sellers list. Publishers Weekly calls Galloway\u2019s biography \u201crichly detailed\u201d and \u201criveting,\u201d while The Washington Post says that the author \u201clifts himself clear of previous chronicles.\u201d\nGalloway says the journey of research and writing consumed his waking thoughts.\n\u201cIt really is like a marriage \u2013 you\u2019re living\u00a0with people in your head all the time, so\u00a0you\u2019d better find them interesting,\u201d says\u00a0Galloway, who previously authored \u201cLeading\u00a0Lady: Sherry Lansing and the Making of a\u00a0Hollywood Groundbreaker,\u201d about the first\u00a0woman to lead a major studio.\nGalloway found many reasons to empathize\u00a0with Olivier and Leigh.\n\u201cShe\u2019s the most beautiful woman in the world,\u00a0extremely talented, unusually intellectual,\u00a0and she suddenly finds her whole life\u00a0upended by bipolar disorder,\u201d the author says.\u00a0\u201cWhat that means, pre-lithium \u2013 pre-any\u00a0kind of treatment besides sedation and then\u00a0electroconvulsive therapy \u2013 is heartbreaking.\u201d\nLeigh ascended on the wings of iconic\u00a0roles like Scarlett O\u2019Hara in \u201cGone\u00a0With the Wind\u201d and Blanche DuBois in\u00a0\u201cStreetcar Named Desire.\u201d But she also\u00a0plunged into deep bouts of depression.\n\u201cParalyzed for weeks or even months on\u00a0end, she dragged herself into work, as the\u00a0studio system required,\u201d Galloway says. \u201cYou\u00a0have to admire the courage and the strength\u00a0to execute her art.\u201d\nOlivier had his faults but also showed a\u00a0capacity to endure Leigh\u2019s manic phases,\u00a0which included hallucinations and\u00a0screaming fits, perhaps most famously when\u00a0she peppered him with obscenities during\u00a0one of their stage productions.\nTruly, Madly: Vivien Leigh,\u00a0Laurence Olivier and the\u00a0Romance of the Century by\u00a0Stephen Galloway, dean of Dodge\u00a0College | Grand Central Publishing.\u00a0Immersive research and\u00a0engaging writing take\u00a0readers inside a legendary\u00a0Hollywood relationship\u00a0full of complications.\n\u201cIn the end, he left her, but he put up\u00a0with that for 20 years, which in itself\u00a0is an extraordinary act of generosity,\u201d\u00a0Galloway says. \u201cHe was maligned by fans\u00a0of hers because he did leave her, but she\u00a0never blamed him. I think it just became\u00a0unbearable, and at some point he knew he\u00a0was damaging his art, because he was truly\u00a0an artist.\u201d\nBeyond the details of the volatile romance,\u00a0Galloway includes in his work the insights of\u00a0modern-day medical experts, who shed light\u00a0on how Leigh\u2019s disorder derailed her life and\u00a0crippled the couple\u2019s relationship.\nUltimately, the story that emerges \u201cpulls us\u00a0into the maelstrom and shows us the truth,\u201d\u00a0says former NPR and Los Angeles Times\u00a0film critic Kenneth Turan.\nGalloway isn\u2019t sure how much Chapman film students know about the lives and work of \u201cOld Hollywood\u201d legends like Leigh and Olivier, but the dean is eager to share some lessons, including that \u201cwhat we see on screen is not what we see in life.\u201d\n\u201cWe all think these successful people live\u00a0fabulously happy existences, and that isn\u2019t\u00a0necessarily the case,\u201d Galloway says. \u201cIf the\u00a0work doesn\u2019t engage you, the rest is just\u00a0an illusion.\u201d\n\n\nbooks Chapman in Hollywood Chapman Now faculty publications film film history reasearch \n\n\n\n\n \n\nDennis Arp \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big Picture: How Data Science and Earth Observation Intersect to Study Climate Risks\n\n\n\n\n\n2022 Distinguished Alumni Awards Celebrate Accomplishments of Chapman Alumni\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Canogar\u2019s \u201cPareidolia\u201d Multimedia Artwork Unveiled at Chapman University On April 13, the Phyllis and Ross Escalette Permanent Collection of Art in Wilkinson College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences unveiled its newest artwork installation, \u201cPareidolia,\u201d by internationally renowned...\n\n\nApril 27, 2023 Staci Dumoski\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurel Tamayo \u201921 Inspires Climate-Friendly Action Through Film Laurel Tamayo \u201921 was recently named one of Forbes\u2019 68 Climate Leaders Changing the Film and Television Industry Tamayo is an Impact Campaign Consultant at Rare Entertainment Lab, a behavior change organization that...\n\n\nApril 19, 2023 Staci Dumoski\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandi Simon Center for Dance Ushers in New Era for Dance at Chapman After years of planning, development, design and construction, Chapman University\u2019s Sandi Simon Center for Dance celebrated its grand opening on March 27, 2023.
