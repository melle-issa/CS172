twice been ranked the #1 college for beach lovers). Our community of students, faculty, staff and alumni is full of changemakers who aren't afraid to forge new paths, break with tradition and be boundaryless in\n                        search of solutions that create positive change in society, economies and for human\n                        well-being.\nSpend a few minutes on our site to learn more about the possibilities you can pursue as an Anteater at UCI, and see for yourself what some of those who've gone before you have done. They're\n                        pretty remarkable. And if reading their stories gets you excited about the possibilities\n                        you can pursue, join us. We can't wait to welcome you as an official UCI social sciences Anteater!\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0Undergraduate\n\n\n\u00a0Graduate\n\n\n\u00a0Alumni\n\n\n\u00a0Community Partner\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Read Full Statement...\n\n\n\n\n\nnews\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNadurata receives Mellon/ACLS Dissertation Innovation Fellowship\nFunding award supports the global and international studies graduate student's work on emerging eldercare economy and its impact on the lives of older Filipinos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFernandez earns distinguished UC-wide emeriti award\nPanunzio prize recognizes research and scholarly excellence since retirement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinion: The violence in Sudan is partly our fault\nJacqueline Burns, poli sci Ph.D. student, explains in this guest essay for The New York Times (also ran in The Hill and Letters from an American)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmore news...\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0from the dean\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\nWe are not your standard school. Like Peter, our beloved Anteater mascot, we\u2019re quirky\n                                 and different. We\u2019re on a mission to create positive change in society, economies\n                                 and human well-being by breaking down traditional barriers and pushing the limits\n                                 in teaching, research and service. Doing so requires a different attitude, aim and\n                                 set of actions. Learn more about ours below in our strategic plan.\u00a0After checking us out and you find you\u2019re someone who gets as excited as we do about\n                                 these possibilities, we invite you to join us in our pursuit.\u00a0Bill Maurer, Dean\n\u00a0\nstrategic plan \u00a0 | \u00a0 rankings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nevents\n\n\n\n\nMay   1\n\n\n Disease, Disparities, and Development: Evidence from Chagas Disease Control in Brazil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay   2\n\n\n Neighborhood Context, Everyday Exposure to Poverty, and Health among Older Adults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay   3\n\n\n What Matters to Me and Why\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0academics & research\u00a0\n\n \ndegree programs\n\n \npeople\n\n \ndepartments\n\n \nresearch programs\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalumniengagement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngivingopportunities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommunityoutreach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconnect\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvisit\n\nmaps & directions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquick links\n\nschool directory\u00a0\u2022\n\t\t\t\t\temployment opportunities\u00a0\u2022\n\t\t\t\t\tuc irvine\u00a0\u2022\n                    news\u00a0\u2022\n                    events\u00a0\u2022\n                    give\u00a0\u2022\n                    contact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 UC Irvine School of Social Sciences\n                    - 3151 Social Sciences Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697-5100 - 949.824.2766\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9\n\n\n",
