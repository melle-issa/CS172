This shared journey into excellence and educational opportunity becomes even more meaningful for some families when they give through the parent and family giving program. In fact, Brown\u2019s tradition of parental support\u2014which accounts for nearly 20% of the total philanthropy to the University each year\u2014is the most robust in the Ivy League.\n\nWhen it comes to giving, engaged parents and families have several choices:\u00a0\n\nThe Parents Fund. An annual giving fund that allows Brown to maintain and expand the unparalleled educational opportunities and resources that ensure the success of our students.\nProgrammatic support. Current-use funds in many priorities that offer families a choice to expand their giving in areas where their students are engaged.\u00a0\nCapstone commitments. Multi-year commitments to targeted areas within the University that may coincide with a students\u2019 emerging academic, research, or extracurricular passions; or to priorities that align with existing family philanthropy.\u00a0\nPlanned giving. A gift that includes the University in the family\u2019s estate planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nIn addition, some families involve students in their giving decisions and establish a meaningful tradition of shared family giving to Brown. Students may choose to join the Student Philanthropy Council, the Senior Class Gift Committee, or the Brown Annual Fund Young Leadership Council.\nAnd families whose total annual support to the University exceeds $15,000 are eligible to join a special giving society: Brown Family Fellows.\u00a0\nYour family\u2019s gift\u2014whatever the size\u2014will make an immediate difference for your child and their classmates. Your support can be felt everywhere. It's in the books that feed their quest for knowledge. It's in the classes that transform how they think. And, it's in the experience they will cherish for a lifetime.\nBrown wouldn't be where we are without the generosity and support of our families. Together, you've made our parent and family giving program one of the best in the country \u2014 and are a constant source of our community's strength and resilience.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c  When we welcome a new student to Brown, we are welcoming the family as well. Parents are deeply valued members of this community, and we encourage their active participation and involvement in the life of the University. \n\u201d\n\n\n  President Christina H. Paxson\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown prepares its students to forge their own paths.\nWe invite you to journey alongside them.\nFor more information, contact:\nLaura B.
