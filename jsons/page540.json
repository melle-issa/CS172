Like all things in the AI field, things have already progressed! I thought I\u2019d share some incremental progress and improvements to the WordPress Block Editor assistant to provide some details on the challenges and improvements.\nIt\u2019s striking to me that small incremental improvements make a large difference to productivity and quality of life. This week we\u2019ve focused on the user experience in using the generate assistant.\nContent streaming\nWe\u2019ve overhauled how data is sent to the copilot assistant, so content, blocks and layout are streamed out in real time. Any user of ChatGPT will be familiar with this concept.\nGiven that Gutenberg blocks and layouts are significantly more complex that the text stream that ChatGPT provides, it took a lot of work to partially parse content as it\u2019s being updated. The Gutenberg block parser is not built for streaming updates, so we implemented a progressive streaming parser for blocks to achieve this:\n\n\n\nAs we now stream the response to the prompt, not only does the user get immediate feedback on what they\u2019re likely to get, it\u2019s also now possible to cancel the in-progress writing to correct/provide further guidance to the WordPress AI. You can press ESCAPE to halt the output and provide a new prompt.\n\n\n\nContext aware editing\nWe\u2019ve also improved the context of the assistant considerably. The AI will now understand the data and content elsewhere in the post to provide more accurate and contextual information. For example, in the video shown above for the prompt \u201cmake a league table\u201d, we got a soccer team table. We will now provide a contextual answer depending on the post content and title:\n\n\n\nThis also applies to content throughout the post, and the AI has an understanding of what content came before and what content follows. This lets the user speak more naturally and briefly to LLM.\n\n\n\nSo, that\u2019s a quick look behind the scenes on what were working on and how things are progressing with WordPress AI.
