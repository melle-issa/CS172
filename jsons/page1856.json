This table replaces email notifications previously sent to building occupants by local units.\nWe encourage you to keep in mind several things about this table:\nBeing in a building where a COVID-positive person has been present does not mean you have been exposed. Individuals identified as high-risk close contacts are separately notified and given guidanceOne person can visit many buildings in the course of a day. If 10 buildings are listed for a given date, this does not mean that 10 different COVID-positive individuals were on campus on that date. For the latest case numbers in our university community, please see the COVID-19 Dashboards.Stanford University has a high rate of vaccination in our community. Vaccination against COVID-19 is one of the most effective ways to prevent severe illness and hospitalization. For more information on the university\u2019s vaccination policy and access to the vaccine, click here.\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-related Benefits and Resources\nPlease be advised that employees may be eligible for COVID-19 related benefits under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to:\nCOVID-19 Interim PoliciesSick time under Stanford\u2019s sick leave policy,For regular employees, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.7For faculty, see Chapter 3 of the Faculty HandbookFor Clinician Educators, see Chapter 3.6.A of the School of Medicine Faculty Handbook\u00a0For Academic Staff-Teaching, see Chapter 7 of the Faculty HandbookFor contingent employees, see Administrative Guide Memo 2.1.21Disability benefits, and/orWorkers\u2019 Compensation benefits, if you have suffered a COVID-19 related illness due to exposure at work.\nPostdoctoral scholars should reference Postdoctoral Scholars Policies for information about time off and other benefits.\nCOVID Cleaning and Disinfection Plan\nStanford is committed to maintaining a healthy and safe workplace.
