Master of Science in Computational and Data Sciences\n\n\n\nIn Chapman University\u2019s Master of Science in Computational amd Data Sciences program, you\u2019ll work with distinguished faculty as you develop and apply statistical, machine learning and AI approaches to solve some of society\u2019s most pressing problems. Learn at the cutting edge of innovation in diverse fields such as medicine and epidemiology, climate and Earth hazards, big data and high-performance computing, drug design, genetics, natural language processing, bioinformatics and biotechnology, economics and sports analytics.\n\n\n\nEmployment and Future Opportunities\nU.S. News and World Report recently ranked\u00a0data science as the #6 best job in 2022. In our tech-driven world, employers are increasingly recognizing the value of data science professionals.\u00a0\nChapman\u2019s graduate program in computational and data science will help you find your place in this ever-growing field. Upon graduation, you\u2019ll be greeted with a diverse range of career options.\n\n\n\nOur Students and Alumni\nGraduates of the MS in Computational and Data Science from Chapman have found career success in such roles as:\n\nData Analyst at CHOC\nData Scientist at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nOur alumni have also gone on to work in a variety of industries, such as: \n\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\nHigher Education Institutions\nHealthcare\nMusic Industry\nGovernment Agencies\nLarge tech Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Section\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                Program\n\n                                            \n\nAs the challenges we face\u2014environmental, biological, chemical, geophysical\u2014continue to grow and generate massive amounts of data, it\u2019s computational and data sciences that will help us meet those issues head on.\u00a0 Whereas computer science involves the pursuit of new frontiers chiefly within the realm of computer software and hardware, computational science practitioners apply the knowledge and power of computing to other science disciplines, whether it be running a costly physics experiment through a computer simulation to save millions, or creating new software that can sift through raw data with a far more strategic and sophisticated eye.  Academic Program and Research\nThrough modeling and study of specific phenomena via computer analysis, data mining and software engineering, you will learn to apply extraordinary technology and processes to answer the world\u2019s most complex questions in fields including:\n\nMedicine and Epidemiology \nClimate and Earth Hazards\nBig Data and High-Performance Computing\nDrug Design\nGenetics Analysis\nNatural Language Processing\nBioinformatics and Biotechnology\nEconomics Analysis\nSports Analytics\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                Curriculum\n\n                                            \n\n2022/2023 Curriculum\nPrerequisites\u00a0- equivalent preparation may be used to satisfy the following: \n\nDifferential Equations \nComputer Programming (Data Structures preferred) \nProbability and Statistics \n\nFoundation Courses\u00a0\u2013 For admitted students who have verified potential, but require supplementary support for success in the CADS program.
