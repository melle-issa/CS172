Some students are here with us now for residential student staff training, September Studies, athletics, and more, and many more will be joining us in a few short weeks. We\u2019re excited about fall quarter, and we hope you are, too. As your student embarks on this year\u2019s academic journey, there are lots of informative and fun activities on the horizon, from New Student Orientation to social events for all class years, including outdoor food and music festivals, movies under the stars, and more. Please be assured we\u2019ll continue to take health precautions while offering students all kinds of opportunities to have fun and connect with each other.\nIn addition to house programs, each neighborhood will host get-togethers as well so students can become acquainted or re-acquainted with their home community for four years. Encourage your student to get involved! Help is needed on neighborhood community councils. This is a great opportunity for them to meet fellow neighborhood residents, get to know professional staff, and plan events that will help everyone make memories for a lifetime. More excellent opportunities to meet friends include the Neighborhood Welcome Barbecues the week of Sept. 26 (co-hosted with our colleagues in Residential & Dining Enterprises) and FestiFall on Oct. 6, when hundreds of student organizations fill White Plaza seeking new members at our biggest outreach event of the year.\nOf course our faculty and academic advising team are looking forward to seeing and meeting with students soon. We know you\u2019re thinking about how best to support your students through the ups and downs of college life, and we\u2019re pleased to announce Stanford will be supplementing our health and well-being resources\u00a0with enhanced attention to helping students manage academic stress.\u00a0The Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education is also collaborating with partners across campus to develop academic initiatives to help support every undergraduate\u2019s intellectual and personal well-being.\nIn closing, we\u2019d like to share a few websites that may be helpful to families preparing for fall quarter. Here\u2019s our academic calendar and a quick overview of many relevant student resources. You can also find lots of information and guidance on the Academic Advising website. Additionally, the university will continue to email this newsletter on a regular basis so you can stay updated while making the shift to mentor and coach. For parents of first years in particular, we know this can be a very difficult transition! Please rest assured that your student is ready, and we\u2019re here to help. If you have questions particular to your student, feel free to reach out to us throughout the year at mykidis@stanford.edu.\nSincerely,\n\nSusie Brubaker-Cole\nVice Provost for Student Affairs\n\nSarah Church\nVice Provost for Undergraduate Education\n \nPost navigation\n\n Previous postSupporting our diverse students with service excellence: A message from Senior Associate Vice Provost for Residential & Dining Enterprises, and Senior Advisor to the Provost on Equity and Inclusion Shirley Everett\nNext postAn update on social life on the Farm from Student Affairs\u2019 Samuel Santos Jr.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nAcademics at Stanford (83)\n\nAlcohol at Stanford (16)\n\nCareer Education (3)\n\nFinances at Stanford (12)\n\nHealth at Stanford (40)\n\nLiving at Stanford (60)\n\nParents Program (5)\n\nParents' Club (4)\n\nSafety at Stanford (41)\n\nStanford Events (56)\n\nUncategorized (14)\n\n\n\n\nArchives\nArchives\n\nSelect Month\n April 2023 \u00a0(1)\n November 2022 \u00a0(1)\n September 2022 \u00a0(1)\n April 2022 \u00a0(1)\n February 2022 \u00a0(1)\n November 2021 \u00a0(1)\n September 2021 \u00a0(3)\n August 2021 \u00a0(1)\n June 2021 \u00a0(4)\n May 2021 \u00a0(4)\n April 2021 \u00a0(3)\n March 2021 \u00a0(4)\n February 2021 \u00a0(5)\n January 2021 \u00a0(2)\n December 2020 \u00a0(1)\n September 2020 \u00a0(3)\n August 2020 \u00a0(2)\n July 2020 \u00a0(1)\n June 2020 \u00a0(4)\n May 2020 \u00a0(3)\n March 2020 \u00a0(3)\n February 2020 \u00a0(2)\n January 2020 \u00a0(2)\n December 2019 \u00a0(1)\n November 2019 \u00a0(2)\n October 2019 \u00a0(5)\n September 2019 \u00a0(4)\n August 2019 \u00a0(2)\n July 2019 \u00a0(3)\n June 2019 \u00a0(3)\n May 2019 \u00a0(3)\n April 2019 \u00a0(2)\n March 2019 \u00a0(2)\n February 2019 \u00a0(6)\n January 2019 \u00a0(3)\n December 2018 \u00a0(1)\n November 2018 \u00a0(2)\n October 2018 \u00a0(2)\n September 2018 \u00a0(4)\n August 2018 \u00a0(2)\n May 2018 \u00a0(4)\n April 2018 \u00a0(2)\n March 2018 \u00a0(6)\n February 2018 \u00a0(4)\n January 2018 \u00a0(1)\n November 2017 \u00a0(4)\n October 2017 \u00a0(3)\n September 2017 \u00a0(5)\n August 2017 \u00a0(5)\n July 2017 \u00a0(2)\n June 2017 \u00a0(2)\n May 2017 \u00a0(5)\n April 2017 \u00a0(3)\n March 2017 \u00a0(4)\n February 2017 \u00a0(2)\n January 2017 \u00a0(3)\n December 2016 \u00a0(3)\n October 2016 \u00a0(3)\n September 2016 \u00a0(4)\n August 2016 \u00a0(2)\n July 2016 \u00a0(3)\n June 2016 \u00a0(3)\n May 2016 \u00a0(2)\n April 2016 \u00a0(4)\n March 2016 \u00a0(2)\n February 2016 \u00a0(8)\n January 2016 \u00a0(3)\n December 2015 \u00a0(2)\n November 2015 \u00a0(7)\n October 2015 \u00a0(2)\n September 2015 \u00a0(7)\n August 2015 \u00a0(1)\n July 2015 \u00a0(3)\n June 2015 \u00a0(5)\n May 2015 \u00a0(1)\n April 2015 \u00a0(3)\n March 2015 \u00a0(3)\n February 2015 \u00a0(1)\n January 2015 \u00a0(1)\n December 2014 \u00a0(1)\n November 2014 \u00a0(1)\n October 2014 \u00a0(4)\n September 2014 \u00a0(3)\n June 2014 \u00a0(3)\n May 2014 \u00a0(1)\n April 2014 \u00a0(2)\n March 2014 \u00a0(1)\n February 2014 \u00a0(5)\n January 2014 \u00a0(2)\n November 2013 \u00a0(1)\n October 2013 \u00a0(1)\n September 2013 \u00a0(3)\n August 2013 \u00a0(1)\n June 2013 \u00a0(1)\n April 2013 \u00a0(2)\n March 2013 \u00a0(5)\n February 2013 \u00a0(1)\n December 2012 \u00a0(3)\n September 2012 \u00a0(3)\n June 2012 \u00a0(1)\n May 2012 \u00a0(2)\n February 2012 \u00a0(1)\n January 2012 \u00a0(2)\n December 2011 \u00a0(4)\n November 2011 \u00a0(1)\n August 2011 \u00a0(2)\n May 2011 \u00a0(1)\n April 2011 \u00a0(1)\n February 2011 \u00a0(1)\n January 2011 \u00a0(2)\n October 2010 \u00a0(1)\n August 2010 \u00a0(1)\n July 2010 \u00a0(1)\n March 2010 \u00a0(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nNewsletter\n\nEmail newsletter archive\n \n\n\n\n\n\nStanford + Parents/Guardians\n The student is at the center \u2014 and is the focus \u2014 of this important partnership.\n\nOur Policy\nProspective Parents\n\n\n  \n\nParents' Helpline\n\nmykidis@stanford.edu\n650-725-0649\n \n\n\n  \n\nIn an Emergency\n\nemergency.stanford.edu\n650-725-5555\n 844-ALERTSU (844-253-7878)  \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Home\nMaps & Directions\nSearch Stanford\nEmergency Info\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy\nCopyright\nTrademarks\nNon-Discrimination\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University,  Stanford, California 94305.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n",
