Work?\u00a0Your timing is perfect!\u00a0 Social Work is a rapidly growing field.\u00a0 According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the next decade will see a 16% increase in employment opportunities for social workers.\u00a0 Specifically, there will be a 14% growth in child, family & school social work positions; a 20% growth in health care & medical social work positions; and a 19% growth in mental health & substance abuse positions.\u00a0 Social workers can also be found working on social welfare policy, community organizing, working with older adults, and managing non-profit organizations.\u00a0\u00a0The profession of social work is guided by a set of key values which include service, social justice, respecting the dignity and worth of every individual, holding the importance of human relationships as central, integrity, and competence in practice.\u00a0 A degree in social work is highly respected, valuable, malleable, and offers prospects for a lifetime of opportunities in social service, government, and grassroots organizations.\u00a0The Mission of the School of Social Work is to provide accessible, high-quality education for generalist practice at the baccalaureate level and advanced generalist practice at the graduate level. We educate students to be ethical, knowledgeable, and versatile practitioners and leaders who value collaboration, social and economic justice, and lifelong learning.\u00a0The School of Social Work at Chico State offers an\u00a0undergraduate degree (BSW) in Social Work\u00a0as well as a\u00a0Master's degree in Social Work (MSW)\u00a0which may be completed in a one-year, two-year, or three-year program.\u00a0 Our Programs are accredited by the\u00a0Council on Social Work Education(opens in new window)\u00a0and include practical training and supervision\u00a0in the field. We have a particularly strong training program in\u00a0Child Welfare\u00a0as well as a\u00a0Distributed Learning Program, which allows students to take courses largely online with periodic visits to campus for in-person instruction.Please take a look around our website and let us know when you\u2019re ready to join us!AnnouncementsSocial Work is pleased to present our new Mission Statement & Statement of Inclusivity(opens in new window)Health & Human Services Majors Brochure (PDF)MSW Program Info Meetings for 2023-2024 A/Y(opens in new window)Health & Human Service majors at Chico State\u00a0Getting Started with the Point in Time App Instructions (PDF)The Mental Health Symposium -\u00a0Wednesday, May 3 2023, at 8am-12pm in\u00a0Colusa Hall (100 A & B).
