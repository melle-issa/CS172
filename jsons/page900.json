deeply, to write boldly and thoughtfully, and to engage in interdisciplinary scholarship and creative activity. Coursework ranges across literature, rhetoric, and cultural studies; creative writing; journalism; digital humanities; and creative and cultural industries. Our English students and faculty explore and create the stories that shape our worlds.The English Department invites students to pursue coursework in multiple areas of English Studies. Our topics-based literature and rhetoric courses cover a wide variety of genres, themes, time periods, international traditions and critical theories. We offer creative writing workshops in fiction, poetry, screenwriting, and creative nonfiction. Our practice-based journalism courses focus on reporting and writing, new media, and editing. From \"Writing for Video Games\" to \"Race and Shakespeare,\" courses in the English Department blend traditional and innovative scholarship.\nThe vibrant conversations among English students and faculty extend beyond the classroom, too. Opportunities include an active chapter of Sigma Tau Delta (English Honors Society),\u00a0Calliope\u00a0(student literary journal), ChapBook\u00a0(student online magazine), Tabula Poetica (international poetry journal) and The John Fowles Center for Creative Writing (creative writing research center).\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle Section\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                Undergraduate Degrees\n\n                                            \n\nBachelor of Arts (BA) in EnglishUnder the guidance of faculty advisors, English majors complete a program in one of two areas of study: literature, rhetoric and cultural studies or journalism. Each student is required to take the 18-credit English core, in addition to a 24-28 credit area of study. Students earning a B.A. in English may not double major in the B.F.A. in Creative Writing.\nBachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Creative WritingWith its focus on the study of important works, this degree combines literature courses and writing workshops to explore students' talents as creative writers. Students earning a B.F.A. in Creative Writing may not double major in the B.A. in English.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                Undergraduate Minors\n\n                                            \n\nMinor in EnglishA Minor in English requires a total of 18 credits in English at or above the 200-level. At least nine credits must be upper-division. Students who wish to design a minor in a particular area of interest should speak with an advisor in the Department of English.\nMinor in JournalismThis minor requires a total of 25 credits in English courses above ENG 103, with at least 12 upper-division credits. It may be combined with any undergraduate major outside the Department of English.\u00a0\nMinor in Rhetoric and Composition StudiesThis minor requires a total of 21 credits in English, 15 of which must be upper division courses. Students will gain a foundational understanding of the field of rhetorical studies, and explore a variety of methodological approaches to the study of language and writing.\u00a0\nMinor in Visual JournalismA Minor in Visual Journalism is for liberal arts students seeking exposure to multimedia journalism, digital and print photography, layout, design, videography and online editing. The program allows students to explore the practice, history and theory of design, photography, videography, editing and journalism and gives them the opportunity to test their skills by working with campus and professional news organizations. All courses are taught by working professionals or faculty members with extensive professional media experience.\nEditor-in-Residence\nThrough the Editor-in-Residence program, journalism students work with editors at Voice of OC, Orange County's awarding-winning nonprofit, nonpartisan digital daily, creating and posting coverage of civic news. Norberto Santana, veteran reporter and editor and winner of the prestigious Diversity News Leadership Award, is Chapman's Editor-in-Residence. Santana, a pioneer in the national nonprofit news movement, is consistently named one of Orange County's Top Influencer in annual rankings. Professor Santana has worked with students in since 2018 when Wilkinson College's Journalism Program launched the Collegiate News Service and its nationally recognized Civic News Initiative, \"one of the most innovative programs in the nation,\" according to University of Vermont Professor Richard Watts, director of the Knight\u00adfunded Center for Community News. Scores of students have published hundreds of stories in Voice of OC, and many have used that work to win highly selective internships and jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                Graduate Degrees\n\n                                            \n\nWilkinson College currently offers three master\u2019s-level degrees in English: an MFA in Creative Writing, an MA in English, and a Dual Degree in English and Creative Writing.\n\nMaster of Arts (MA) in EnglishThe MA degree is designed for students seeking continuing education, a foundation for doctoral work (PhD, EdD, JD), and/or a credential qualifying them to teach literature and composition courses at junior and community colleges.\nMaster of Fine Arts (MFA) in Creative WritingThe MFA is a terminal degree in creative writing. Many MFA graduates teach at two- and four-year colleges, publish their work, or go on to professional careers in writing and editing. The MFA program at Chapman University fosters the growth of fiction writers, poets, creative nonfiction writers and even screenwriters through workshops, techniques courses, literature courses,\u00a0The John Fowles Reading Series,\u00a0Tabula Poetica, and the literary journal\u00a0Calliope.\nDual MA/MFA DegreeThe Dual Degree combines the MFA and the MA. This innovative program combines the practice and study of creative writing with literary and rhetorical scholarship. It allows students to spend three years building the foundation for their future as readers and writers on the job and well beyond. \nAccelerated Bachelor of Arts/Master of Arts in EnglishUndergraduate English majors can earn a graduate degree with just ONE additional year of study! You\u2019ll be able to complete both your bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree in just five years: four years of undergrad study and one year of graduate work.\u00a0\nFor more information about any of the Graduate Programs in Wilkinson College, please contact\u00a0David Krausman.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                Stories Published by our Students!\n\n                                            \n\nTake a look at some of the publications some our students have written for.\nClick here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish\n\n\nProspective Students\n\n\nStudent Resources\n\n\nStudy Abroad\n\n\nOrganizations & Publications\n\n\nScholarship & Aid\n\n\nCommunity Creative Writing Workshop\n\n\nFaculty Directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed more information? \n\nWilkinson Hall 217Chapman University1 University DriveOrange, CA 92866(714) 997-6750\n\n\nSend us an email!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Contact Us   Maps & Directions    Emergency \n\n\n\nOrange Campus\nOne University Drive  Orange, CA 92866   (714) 997-6815\n\nRinker Health Science Campus\n9401 Jeronimo Road  Irvine, CA 92618 \n\n\n\nGet Started\n\nVisit Chapman\nView Tuition and Aid\nApply Now\nEmployment\n\n\n\nDiscover\n\nSchools and Colleges\nPrograms at Chapman\nEvents at Chapman\nNewsroom\nDirectory\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\nReport Concern or Incident\nAccessibility Feedback\nWebsite Feedback\nDisability Services\nConsumer Disclosures\nPrivacy Policy\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n Chapman Logo                                               \n\u00a9 2022 Chapman University           \n\n\n Back to top    \n\n\n\n\n\n/_featured/wilkinson/wilkinson-main.xml\nWilkinson\nWILKINSON\nDo Not Show\nDo Not Show\n\n\n\n",
