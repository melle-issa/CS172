When not working with her SDSU students,\n                              Linfor collaborates with faculty from elementary school to university around issues\n                              of alignment, inclusion, skill based learning, and curriculum.\nHer work has been pivotal to the removal of remedial courses in the CSU and Community\n                              College systems as well as the implementation of multiple measures for course placement.\n                              She has led equity efforts in terms of systematic and structural oppression for minoritized\n                              students both in terms of curriculum, pedagogy, assessment, and policy in statewide\n                              and local initiatives such as The Compact for Success, The College Avenue Compact,\n                              Early Assessment Programs, and the California Community College Basic Skill Initiative.\nMost recently, Linfor\u2019s equity work centered on utlization the networks created in\n                              her decades of regional partnerships to create safe educational passagage ways for\n                              queer youth, young adults and students from elementry school through univestity with\n                              parternships with the SDSU Pride Center & LGBTQ Studies, San Diego City Schools, and\n                              Southwestern\u2019s CHEL program.

Reinholz, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Equity in Education\nDepartment of Mathematics and Statistics\n[email\u00a0protected]\n\n\nDaniel L. Reinholz, Ph.D. is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics\n                              and Statistics at San Diego State University. Broadly speaking, Dr. Reinholz\u2019s research\n                              focuses on creating tools for educational transformation, to improve equity and mitigate\n                              systemic oppression. Their research is primarily situated within three interrelated\n                              areas.\nDisability Justice. Dr. Reinholz\u2019s work is grounded in a disability justice perspective\n                              that attends to the intersections of ableism, racism, sexism, and other systems of\n                              oppression. As a disabled educator, Dr. Reinholz aims to open opportunities for disabled\n                              students, especially those who are multiply marginalized. Disability justice provides\n                              a lens and a vision for what a truly transformative and liberatory education system\n                              could look like.\nEquity Analytics. Dr. Reinholz is a co-developer of the EQUIP tool, which is a free\n                              web-based classroom observational tool for tracking patterns of implicit bias in teaching.\n                              EQUIP is designed to empower teachers, professional developers, and researchers to\n                              understand and improve equity in classroom teaching. EQUIP provides data to help illuminate\n                              the subtle and sometimes invisible racialized and gendered patterns that play out\n                              in classroom participation, which can serve to privilege some students over others.\nInstitutional Transformation. Ultimately, the goal of Dr. Reinholz\u2019s work is to change\n                              the education system so that it can be more just and better serve the needs of all\n                              students. For this reason, they study education from a systems perspective, and develop\n                              new models that can be used for change. They are a working group leader in the Accelerating\n                              Systemic Change Network (ASCN), which aims to support researchers to better use change\n                              theory in their projects.\nTogether, these three areas of research work in conjunction, beginning with a vision\n                              for what the education system could look like, using analytics to help draw attention\n                              to that vision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmy Sanchez Arteaga, MFA\nLecturer of Art History\n\n\n\nAmy Sanchez Arteaga makes art, teaches, and writes about living as a transborder subject\n                              between the Californias. Since 2010 she has worked as part of Cognate Collective,\n                              a binational research and art collaboration that explores how cultural and economic\n                              exchange between transnational communities can be mobilized to build networks of solidarity\n                              that defy solidifying (geo)political boundaries. She is a lecturer in the department\n                              of Art + Design where she teaches Latin American Art History, Border Art History,\n                              Feminist Cultural Production and Contemporary Art Theory. Her research is interested\n                              in the intersection of Art theory and Art practice as critical aesthetic praxis, the\n                              influence of feminisms of the Americas on collective and community-based art practices,\n                              and Sound Art.\nSanchez Arteaga holds an MFA in Art from UC Irvine with an emphasis in Critical and\n                              Curatorial Studies, where she also completed the Critical Theory and Graduate Feminist\n                              Emphases. As part of Cognate Collective she has exhibited work locally and internationally\n                              at venues including the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, the Getty Center, The\n                              Craft Contemporary, School of the Art Institute of Chicago, FLACSO Arte Actual in\n                              Quito, Ecuador, and the Organ Kritischer Kunst in Berlin, Germany.

He researches intersectionality\n                              and transdisciplinary literature, such as hip hop and spirituality, and Africana philosophy\n                              of religion from a global comparativist perspective to understand unique African American\n                              searches for self-realization through emerging and alternative religious and philosophical\n                              movements. He examines theories of religious pluralism in African diaspora cultures\n                              that center on epistemologies of emancipation and praxes of liberation.\nDr. Whitaker is passionate about equity issues marginalized communities confront,\n                              particularly Black men, in academic disciplines and higher education more broadly.\n                              He\u2019s facilitated anti-racism workshops, developed social justice, anti-oppression\n                              curriculum, and implemented diversity initiatives. He assists SDSU in realizing its\n                              strategic plan of \u2018equity and inclusion in everything we do.\u2019\nDr. Whitaker is published in the Journal of Contemporary Religion, Journal of Ecumenical Studies, Public Religion Research Institute\u2019s Spotlight Analysis, and The Washington Post, as well as cited in the San Diego Union-Tribune, and he has been interviewed by KPBS Public Media.\nDr. Whitaker enjoys hiking, tennis, running half-marathons, cultural centers, and\n                              attending live concerts, like blues player Keb\u2019 Mo\u2019 and jazz singer Gregory Porter.\nIf you have questions please email us at [email\u00a0protected].\nEvents\n\n\n\nWOC Reading Circle\n\n\nThis is a communal space led by women of color faculty and dedicated to participants\n                                       who identify as women of color faculty interested in coming together to cultivate\n                                       fellowship and deepen their engagement regarding the lived experiences of BIPOC women\n                                       in higher education. Following up on the momentum of the inaugural reading circle\n                                       with women faculty of color in spring 2020, this circle aims to expand communal relations\n                                       and intellectual exchange. Weekly readings will be assigned and discussion prompts\n                                       offered to guide engagement at each session. The selected text for the group will\n                                       be provided in paperback free of charge as long as participants commit to at least\n                                       4 out of the 5 sessions.\n\n\n\n\nDisability Justice as Praxis\n\n\nThis three-part series focuses on how insights from the disability justice movement\n                                       can be applied to our classroom teaching and learning environments to advance the\n                                       goal of collective liberation. Disability justice focuses on collective liberation,\n                                       with particular attention to how ableism intersects with other systems of oppression\n                                       such as racism, cisheterosexism, imperialism, and capitalism. Disability justice is\n                                       a movement that was founded by Black, Brown, working class and queer, disabled activists,\n                                       who aimed to achieve a level of intersectionality that was not present in either disability\n                                       rights or racial justice movements.\n\n\n\n\nTeaching for Equity: Professional Learning Community\n\n\nThis program builds a cohort of faculty members with a strong commitment to equitable\n                                       teaching in their classrooms who would like to become members of a community of practice\n                                       focused on the thoughtful use of data to inform improvement to their instruction.\n                                       Our goal is to create a cohort of equitable teacher-leaders on our campus in alignment\n                                       with SDSU\u2019s strategic priorities. The learning community meets approximately every\n                                       other week during the course of a semester. Between meetings, each participant will\n                                       record a Zoom lecture to be coded with the EQUIP observation tool, which focuses on\n                                       equity in classroom participation. EQUIP will generate actionable analytics that can\n                                       be used as a source of reflection and ongoing improvement. During the community meetings,\n                                       we will work together as a group that is collectively focused on improving equity\n                                       in instruction at SDSU. This is an opportunity for faculty members to receive intensive\n                                       support and meaningful data about their own practice and build a community of similarly\n                                       committed individuals. At the end of the program, participants will be asked to complete\n                                       a reflective evaluation and to share what they have learned with their departmental\n                                       colleagues.\n\n\n\n\nDiscussing Racial Battle Fatigue\n\n\nThis is a six-part co-learning seminar for faculty who would like to unpack the stress\n                                       responses (e.g., frustration, anger, exhaustion, withdrawal, escapism, acceptance\n                                       of racist attributions, etc.) associated with the systemic racial oppression and white\n                                       supremacy in academia. Guided by a critical race approach, participants in this co-learning\n                                       seminar will process together, listen to each other, discuss the racialized positioning\n                                       of faculty experiences in white academia (i.e., BIPOC). Together participants in this\n                                       seminar will strategize actionable ideas on how to work with the realities that faculty\n                                       and people of color are socialized and expected to survive racial battle fatigue and\n                                       whiteness in order to \u201cmake it\u201d in academia. Past participants are welcome to re-engage\n                                       with this group.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSDSU RESOURCES\n\nAbout\nAcademic Calendars\nAcademics\nAdmissions\nCampus Calendar\nCampus Directory\nCampus Life\nEmergency Information\nGive to SDSU\nJobs at SDSU\nMaps and Directions\nNewsCenter\nParking & Transportation\nResearch\nTours\n\nSACD DEPARTMENTS\n\nCareer Services\nCommunication Services\nCounseling & Psychological Services\nEOP & Ethnic Affairs\nFinancial Aid & Scholarships\nNew Student & Parent Programs\nOffice of the Student Ombudsman\nResidential Education Office (Housing)\nStudent Ability Success Center\nStudent Health Services\nStudent Life & Leadership\nStudent Rights & Responsibilities\nTechnology Services\nTesting Services\nWell-being & Health Promotion\n\nCENTERS/PROGRAMS\n\nCenter for Educational Partnerships, Outreach and Success\nCenter for Inclusive Excellence\nCultural Centers\n\n-\u00a0Black Resource Center\n-\u00a0Native Resource Center\n-\u00a0The Pride Center\n-\u00a0Center for Intercultural relations\n-\u00a0Asian Pacific Islander Desi American Resource Center (APIDA)\n-\u00a0Latinx Resource Center\n-\u00a0Women's Resource Center\n-\u00a0Center for Transformative Justice\n\n\nEconomic Crisis Response Team (ECRT)\nEmployee Resource Groups\nInclusive SDSU\nMilitary and Veterans Programs\n\nMAIN AREAS\n\nAccess & Community Standards\nCampus & Community Partnerships\nCampus Life & Dean of Students\nCommunity & Belonging\nFaculty & Staff\nFinance & Operations\nHealth, Well-being & Accessibility\nStrategic Initiatives\n\n\n\nNEW STUDENTS\n\nAbout SDSU\nAdmissions\nFamily Weekend\nFirst-Year Students\nNew Student Orientation\nNew Student & Family Convocation\nTransfer Information\nWelcome Week\n\nSTUDENT RESOURCES\n\nCareers\nFinancial Aid & Scholarships\nGraduate Student Diversity\nHealth and Wellness\nHousing\nStudent who are Parents\n\nCAMPUS LIFE\n\nCampus Life\nCultural Centers\nInternational Students\nLeadership Opportunities\nStudent Organizations\n\nPARENT PROGRAMS\n\nAztec Parents Association\nAztec Parents Fund\nAztec Parents Program\nNew Student & Parent Programs\nNews for Aztec Parents\nParent Hotline\n\nRESOURCES FOR PARENTS\n\nCareer Services Resources for Parents\nFinancial Aid & Scholarships for Parents\nStudent Health Services for Parents\nUseful Tips for Parents\n\nEMPLOYERS & COMMUNITY PARTNERS\n\nCareer Fairs\nInformation for Employers\nOn-Campus Interviews\nSalary Survey Results\nWorkAbility IV\n\n\n\nCENTER FOR INCLUSIVE EXCELLENCE\n\nBuilding on Inclusive Excellence\nProfessors of Equity\nProfessional Development and Facilitation\nResearch & Scholarly Excellence\nResources\n\nEMPLOYEE GROUPS\n\nAbility/Disability ERG\nAsian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) ERG\nBAYANIHAN, Filipino American Faculty and Staff Association\nBlack Faculty Staff Association\nBlack Women in Academia (BWA)\nChristian Community ERG (CCERG)\nFirst-Gen Faculty & Staff Association\nIranian American Faculty Staff Association ERG\nLatina Network\nLatinX, ChicanX & Hispanic Faculty & Staff Association (LCHFSA)\nMen of Color Alliance ERG\nMilitary and Veterans Faculty and Staff Association (Mil-Vet)\nNative American and Indigenous Faculty and Staff Association\nPride ERG\nWomen in Business Academia (WBA)\n\nFACULTY/STAFF INITIATIVES\n\nDiversity Liaisons\nDiversity Planning\n\nDIVERSITY RESOURCES\n\nDiversity Statistics\nLand Acknowledgment\nResources in Response to Incidents of Racial Violence\n\nDIVERSITY INITIATIVES\n\nHispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) Affairs\nPledge Supporting SDSU\u2019s African American Community\nTribal Liaison\nStatements from the Chief Diversity Officer\nInclusive SDSU\n\nSUPPORT US\n\nSupport Student Affairs & Campus Diversity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nLuke Wood\nVice President, Student Affairs and Campus Diversity\n\nFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDivision of Student Affairs & Campus Diversity\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5500 Campanile Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSan Diego, CA 92182-1620\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTelephone: 619-594-5200\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nA-Z Index\nCampus Directory\nMaps\nParking\n\n\n\n\nEmployment\nMedia Relations\nGive to SDSU\nmy.SDSU\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Contact\nNetwork Status\nStrategic Plan\nNewsletter Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 San Diego State University\n\n\nAccessibility\nSDSU Digital Privacy Statement\nFeedback\nCampus Safety Plan\nAnnual Security Report\n\n\nLast Update: July 18, 2016\nDocument Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Updated 10/24/22",
