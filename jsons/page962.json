The Core Development Team builds WordPress. features. We\u2019re excited to announce that most of this work is now complete, and there are ample opportunities to get involved in shaping the future.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s Changed?\nThe following Jetpack features have been removed from the WordPress app and are now only available in the Jetpack app:\nStats\nReader\nNotifications\nActivity Log\nBackup\nSharing (Jetpack Social)\nJetpack blocks (BlockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. Editor)\n@-Mentions and Crossposting (Block Editor)\nIn addition, core features that relied on the WordPress.comWordPress.com An online implementation of WordPress code that lets you immediately access a new WordPress environment to publish your content.  WordPress.com is a private company owned by Automattic that hosts the largest multisite in the world. This is arguably the best place to start blogging if you have never touched WordPress before. https://wordpress.com/ APIAPI An API or Application Programming Interface is a software intermediary that allows programs to interact with each other and share data in limited, clearly defined ways., including People, Themes, and Menus, have been removed from WordPress.com and Jetpack-connected sites. (These features have never been available to self-hosted users without a Jetpack connection from the WordPress app.) Placeholders of Jetpack-powered features will remain in the app for some period of time to allow for a transition for users of these features.\nThere is still some work to be done, particularly with login, which we knew would take some time to decouple. The WordPress.com REST APIREST API The REST API is an acronym for the RESTful Application Program Interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. It is how the front end of an application (think \u201cphone app\u201d or \u201cwebsite\u201d) can communicate with the data store (think \u201cdatabase\u201d or \u201cfile system\u201d) https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/. still authenticates WordPress.com users, and these users should have the option to use the WordPress app if desired. The mobile team will continue to work on this challenge with the aim of eventually removing this dependency.\nHowever, with many Jetpack-specific features now removed, we\u2019re ready to look to the future of the WordPress app.\u00a0\nOne of the goals behind refocusing the app was always to enable larger involvement from the community, and we look forward to seeing all the great contributions and developments that will come from this decision.\u00a0\nHow to Get Involved\nDo you want to help shape the future of the WordPress mobile app? Here\u2019s how you can contribute and make a difference:\nWrite and submit code. If you\u2019re a developer, you can contribute to the app\u2019s codebase by submitting pull requests through GitHubGitHub GitHub is a website that offers online implementation of git repositories that can easily be shared, copied and modified by other developers. Public repositories are free to host, private repositories require a paid subscription.

Fortnightly calls for testing are posted to this blog, with steps you can take to participate.\u00a0\nReport bugs. This can be done through the WordPress for Android, WordPress for iOS, or Gutenberg GitHub repositories. If you\u2019re unsure where to file your report, you can get guidance in the #mobile channel on SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform https://slack.com/. The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at https://make.wordpress.org/chat/. or add your comment to the fortnightly calls for testing.\u00a0\nSuggest or design new features. If you want to get further involved in the app\u2019s design, check out the #design channel on Slack and follow +design.\nOpen GitHub tickets with your proposals for the path forward.\nTranslate the app. If you\u2019re fluent in a language other than English, you can help by translating the app so more people can use it.\nHelp others. You can answer questions and help others in the new WordPress mobile app\u2019s support forum.\nHave questions? Not sure how to contribute? Comment on this post or ask in the Slack #mobile channel.

The Core Development Team builds WordPress. experience. As part of this effort, we saw an opportunity to rethink how we handle support for the WordPress mobile apps and the outcome of this was the new forum for the WordPress app: https://wordpress.org/support/forum/mobile/.\nThe problem this solves\nFor the past few years, WordPress.comWordPress.com An online implementation of WordPress code that lets you immediately access a new WordPress environment to publish your content.  WordPress.com is a private company owned by Automattic that hosts the largest multisite in the world. This is arguably the best place to start blogging if you have never touched WordPress before. https://wordpress.com/ Happiness Engineers have been providing support for the WordPress app, including support for self-hosted users. Tickets submitted via an in-app support flow routed to a private queue that WordPress.com Happiness Engineers can reply to.\nSeparate from the in-app support flow, dedicated WordPress.orgWordPress.org The community site where WordPress code is created and shared by the users. This is where you can download the source code for WordPress core, plugins and themes as well as the central location for community conversations and organization.  https://wordpress.org/ support forums previously existed for the Android and iOSiOS The operating system used on iPhones and iPads. WordPress apps. These forums were closed as part of an effort to retire older and infrequently used bbPressbbPress Free, open source software built on top of WordPress for easily creating forums on sites. https://bbpress.org. installations. As most users were going through the in-app support flow for help and the mobile forums were rarely used, it wasn\u2019t deemed necessary to migrate the forums to the newer forum setup on WordPress.org.\nWith the effort to remove all WordPress.com and Jetpack dependencies from the WordPress app, it no longer became appropriate for support requests to only be routed to WordPress.com Happiness Engineers. The mobile team revisited the current in-app support flow to figure out where users who are looking for help can be best served.\u00a0\nThe new vision for support\nIn the spirit of providing a closer-to-core experience, from WordPress mobile app v22.0 onward, all users will now be directed to the new forum to get help in public from the WordPress community.\u00a0\nWe created the new forum as the best resource to get support for the WordPress mobile apps. By guiding users to the dedicated forum to get help, we bring the WordPress mobile apps in alignment with the way core WordPress software handles support.\nHow did we make this happen\nThe WordPress community made this happen through collaboration in the Support Team discussion channel in SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform https://slack.com/. The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at https://make.wordpress.org/chat/. and MetaMeta Meta is a term that refers to the inside workings of a group. For us, this is the team that works on internal WordPress sites like WordCamp Central and Make WordPress.
