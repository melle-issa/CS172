This event will celebrate and examine contemporary native life as well as highlight Wilbur's personal experiences with numerous tribes across North America during the production of her book \u201cProject 562.\u201d During this book tour event, Wilbur will give a keynote address, take part in a moderated Q & A and hold a book signing.\n\u201cProject 562,\u201d released in April 2023, aims to transform our perception of Native America. It contains hundreds of stunning portraits and compelling personal narratives of contemporary Native people. This crowd-funded initiative is an invitation to visit, engage and photograph people from over 562 sovereign Tribal Nations in North America. This is Wilbur\u2019s fourth major creative venture elevating Native American identity and culture.\nMatika Wilbur is a critically acclaimed social documentarian and photographer from the Swinomish and Tulalip peoples of coastal Washington. Serving as a co-host of the \u201cAll My Relations\u201d podcast Wilbur invites guests to delve into subjects facing Native peoples today and explore the connections between land, non-human relatives and one another. She has presented over 300 keynotes at institutions including Harvard, Yale, Berkeley, Google, TED Talks and the National Education Association. Wilbur is also a National Geographic Explorer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nCampus Master Calendar\nCal Poly News\nEvent Submissions\n\n\n\n\nExplore\n\n\nPerforming Arts Center\nCal Poly Athletics\nASI Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday\n\n\nCal Poly CampusClouds54\u2109\nCal Poly PierTides2:13 PMLow8:43 PMHigh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Grand Avenue,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSan Luis Obispo, CA 93407\n\n805-756-1111\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Footer Primary\n\n\nUniversity Home\n\n\nMy Cal Poly Portal\n\n\nCampus Map\n\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\n\nHealth and Wellbeing\n\n\nCampus Safety\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Footer Secondary\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\n\nWeb Accessibility Statement\n\n\n\n\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\nCampus Annual Security Report (PDF)\n\n\n\n\nCampus Safety Plan (PDF)\n\n\n\n\nPDF Reader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Learn by DoingSM has been Cal Poly\u2019s pedagogy since 1901\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCalifornia Polytechnic State University\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
