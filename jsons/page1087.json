To this end, individuals having reason to believe that a student has been missing should immediately notify the Chapman University Department of Public Safety at 714-997-6763.\nThese reports may also be made to Residence Life and First Year Experience in the Davis Community Center or the Dean of Students Office in Argyros Forum 101. If the missing person report is made to staff or organizations other than Chapman University Department of Public Safety, the entity must contact Public Safety immediately.\nA student residing in on-campus housing is determined to be missing when the Chapman University Department of Public Safety or other law enforcement agency determines that:\n\nThe student has been missing for more than 24 hours without any known reason,\nThe reported information is credible, and\nThe circumstances warrant officially declaring the student to be missing.\n\nUnless there is evidence to the contrary, a student residing in on-campus housing will not necessarily be considered missing if the student provided information about their intended whereabouts to the Residence Life and First Year Experience or if the student is absent during recognized University holidays or breaks.\nA student may be considered to be missing if his or her absence is contrary to their usual pattern of behavior and/or if unusual circumstances may have caused the absence. Such circumstances may include, but not be limited to, a report or suspicion that the missing student may be the victim of foul play, has expressed suicidal thoughts, is under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, is in danger, or has been with persons who may endanger the student\u2019s welfare.\nContact Procedures\nAll enrolled students at Chapman University, regardless of their living circumstances, should designate a Confidential Contact.\nA Confidential Contact is an individual(s) that the student prefers Chapman University officials contact in the event that the student is determined to be missing for a period of more than 24 hours. The information provided for the Confidential Contact is confidential and accessible only to authorized campus officials. The contact information may not be disclosed to any party except to law enforcement personnel in furtherance of an official missing person investigation. The University suggests that students notify their Confidential Contacts that they have been designated as such.\nAll enrolled students at Chapman University living on campus are required to designate a Confidential Contact during the housing application process. It is suggested that students living off campus also designate a Confidential Contact. Every student (resident and non-resident) has a student account on PeopleSoft where they may designate contact information for their selected Confidential Contact. Students should update their personal information at the beginning of each academic year. Students are solely responsible for the accuracy of the information provided and updating the information when needed.\nIn the event that the missing student is under the age of 18 and is not emancipated, the custodial parent or guardian on the student\u2019s file at the time that the underage student is determined to be missing will also be contacted within 24 hours in addition to the student\u2019s Confidential Contact. If at any time for any reason the custody or guardianship of the student changes during his or her time at the University, the student must update their records immediately.\nWhen a Report is Made\nWhen a report is received that a student\u2019s whereabouts are unknown, Chapman may employ such steps as are appropriate in determining the student\u2019s whereabouts; these step may include some or all of the following:\n\nCheck of the student\u2019s campus residence.\nAttempt to contact the student via phone or internet.\nInterview roommates or other students, as appropriate, to gather additional information about the student\u2019s location and recent activities.\nAccess the student\u2019s class schedule and try to contact them in class.\nInvestigate the students\u2019 ID card usage to determine which room the student last used their ID card to enter and when they last used their ID card to purchase food on campus.\nShould the above measures be unsuccessful in locating the student, the university shall deem the student as \u201cmissing\u201d and within 24 hours notify appropriate law enforcement agencies and the student\u2019s Confidential Contact.\n\nWhen Public Safety makes a determination that a student who is the subject of a missing person report has been missing for more than 24 hours and has not returned to the campus, the Department of Public Safety will initiate the emergency contact procedures in accordance with the student\u2019s Confidential Contact designation and will also notify local law enforcement that has jurisdiction in the area the student went missing. This will be done within 24 hours, regardless of whether or not the student had a Confidential Contact, is above the age of 18 or is an emancipated minor.\nAdditionally, Public Safety may release a photo of the missing student as a tool to assist in locating the individual and may seek information and/or assistance from a variety of campus resources during the course of the investigation.\nPolicy updated July 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                State Law Violation Complaint Procedure\n\n                                                \n\nAn individual may contact the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education for review of a complaint.\nCalifornia Bureau of Private Postsecondary Education\n2535 Capitol Oaks Drive, Suite 400Sacramento, CA 95833\nPhone: (916) 431\u20106924Fax: (916) 263-\u00ad1897\nbppe@dca.ca.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                Title IX - Prohibiting Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence\n\n                                                \n\nIn accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Chapman University prohibits gender and sex-based discrimination in academic, educational, co-curricular, and athletic programs and activities. Title IX protects all people regardless of their gender or gender identity from sexual harassment and sexual violence, which are forms of sex discrimination.\nThe policies regarding Title IX related matters are part of the University\u2019s Harassment and Discrimination policy and the Student Conduct Code which are accessible through the\u00a0University website.\u00a0 The University also has a\u00a0webpage that is inclusive of Title IX related policies, reporting processes, resources, and programs.\nChapman\u2019s Annual Security report can be found on the Public Safety website under \"Statistics\".\nThe University has designated a Title IX Coordinator to oversee the implementation of Title IX, including the administrative responsibility of reviewing Title IX complaints. Inquiries concerning the application of Title IX to\u00a0university programs and activities may be referred to: Colleen Wood, Assistant Vice President and Associate Dean of Students, Title IX Coordinator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources\n\n\nToggle Section\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                General Consumer Information Contacts\n\n                                                \n\nIn addition to the sections of this webpage, individual sections may direct students, employees and others to specific Chapman University webpages.
