Memorial and honorary gifts may be submitted by fax or mail on our SSU Gift Form.\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEndowments\n\n\n\n\nEndowments are permanent assets that are invested to provide both current and future revenue streams to support the academic mission of the University. Endowments can be established to provide financial support for scholarships, professorships, academic programs, athletic and performing arts programs, and more. To establish an endowment at SSU, the minimum initial contribution level is $25,000.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nScholarships\n\n\n\n\nScholarships serve a major role in providing necessary funding for Sonoma State students who have demonstrated academic excellence. The Scholarship Office currently administers more than 200 separate funds that provide approximately 400 distinct scholarship awards. More than 54 percent\u00a0of the student body receives financial aid, and 27 percent\u00a0receives assistance from scholarships or grants. Without this valuable and vital support, these students would be unable to attend SSU. The minimum scholarship awarded is $250.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\nSonoma State University \u00a0| \u00a0University Advancement \u00a0| \u00a0Salazar\u00a0Hall, Room 2043\n1801 East Cotati Avenue, Rohnert Park, CA 94928\nPhone: 707.664.2712 \u00a0| \u00a0Fax: 707.664.2952 \u00a0 | \u00a0Email: advancement@sonoma.edu\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere to Find\n\n\n\n\nAlumni Association\nAthletics\nDevelopment\nGreen Music Center\nScholarships\nGiving Forms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Advancement\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Avenue\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYoutube\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Ave\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n707.664.2880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact SSU\nPrivacy Notice\nCalifornia State University\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSafeSSU\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\nEmergency Information\nJobs\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
