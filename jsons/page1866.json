Commuters, residents, and departments can purchase virtual parking permits, enter license plate information for vehicles they plan to park on campus, and link those vehicles to their permit.\n\nIf you are a visitor, you can use ParkMobile in visitor parking areas. Tour groups must reserve parking spaces in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nParking Permit Rates\n\nView all parking rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHow to Purchase\n\nWhether you are a Stanford affiliate or visitor, check out your purchasing options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommuters\n\n\nIf you are commuting to Stanford, you have a number of options for selecting and paying for parking. Before you decide, consider sustainable commute options and the many incentives Stanford offers.\n\n\n\n\n\nResident Students\n\n\nIf you are a resident student, you can purchase a resident permit, but you cannot purchase a commuter permit. With the many transportation resources on campus, consider going car-free.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisitors\n\n\nVisitors can use Parkmobile to park at the main campus and Stanford Redwood City. \n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nOur office can work with campus event planners to reserve event parking. When scheduling events, try to avoid peak times (arrivals from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. and departures from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.).\n\n\n\n\n\nTour Groups\n\n\nAll campus tours and visits that are not organized by Stanford must reserve a tour access time slot. \n\n\n\n\n\nDepartments\n\n\nDepartments can find parking and additional resources for their business needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSP&TS Primary Navigation (Second Level)\n\n\nPurchase a Parking Permit\n\n\nPermit Prices\n\n\nOrder Parking\n\n\nPermit Cancellation/Return Policy\n\n\nCommuters\n\n\nResident Students\n\n\nVisitors and Departments\n\n\n\n\nLearn About Tickets, Enforcement, and Lost/Stolen Permits\n\n\nParking Enforcement\n\n\nPay a Parking Ticket\n\n\nAppeal a Parking Ticket\n\n\nRules and Regulations\n\n\n\n\nFind Parking, EV Charging, and Off-Campus Sites\n\n\nView Parking and Circulation map\n\n\nFind an Electric Vehicle Charging Station\n\n\nParking & Marguerite Impacts\n\n\nOff-Campus Worksites\n\n\n\n\nRequest Tour Bus Parking\n\n\nReserve Tour Parking\n\n\n\n\nFind Event Parking\n\n\nReserve Galvez Lot for Your Event\n\n\nTake a Shuttle To or From Your Event\n\n\nRequest Charter Shuttles\n\n\nReduce Peak Hour Trips at Stanford\n\n\n\n\nLearn About Carts, Service Vehicles, and Access\n\n\nParking Garage Height Restrictions\n\n\nPersons With Disabilities\n\n\nGolf Cart-Type Vehicles\n\n\nService/Delivery Vehicles\n\n\nPedestrian Zone Access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSP&TS Footer Navigation\n\n\nVisitors, Vendors, and Departments\n\n\nMaps, Resources, and Access\n\n\nGetting Started at Stanford\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nContact\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSU Navigation\n\n\nStanford Home\n\n\nMaps & Directions\n\n\nSearch Stanford\n\n\nEmergency Info\n\n\n\n\nSU Policy Links\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\nCopyright\n\n\nTrademarks\n\n\nNon-Discrimination\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University.
