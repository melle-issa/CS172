That\u2019s because the university\u2019s students and faculty researchers now have at their fingertips one of the fastest supercomputer clusters in the region.\nThe new computer system, capable of performing 8 quadrillion calculations a second, is the product of Chapman\u2019s participation in the CEO Leadership Alliance of Orange County, a working group that includes executives at some of the most influential high-tech companies in Orange County.\nVideo graphics giant Nvidia Corp. donated the computer cluster to advance the shared goal of preparing more students from underserved communities and to help ensure that the region\u2019s tech workforce is ready to thrive at the cutting edge of AI advances.\nKeith Strier, vice president of worldwide AI initiatives for Nvidia, told the Orange County Business Journal that the donation of hardware is \u201cthe first community-operated supercomputer\u201d in the nation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be a part of it,\u201d he added.\nChapman is equally enthusiastic as it prepares students to work with next-generation technology and provides research expertise that feeds \u201ca huge tech startup ecosystem here in Orange County,\u201d said Andrew Lyon, dean of Chapman\u2019s Fowler School of Engineering.\u00a0 \u201cThis kind of computing power allows us to ask research questions that couldn\u2019t be attacked previously.\u201d\nThe new supercomputer, which is being installed in the Beckman Hall data center, was expected to be at least partially online before the start of the fall 2022 semester.\n\u201cThis is a different computer paradigm, so there\u2019s going to be a learning curve,\u201d Lyon said. \u201cThat learning will happen as we finish our infrastructure upgrades, and then we\u2019ll be off to the races.\u201d\nThe choice of Chapman for the supercomputer cluster speaks to the university\u2019s ambitions and \u201chow important it is to address the big research questions with the broadest collection of scholars,\u201d Lyon added. \u201cThese types of facilities have their own gravitational pull, bringing in people excited to work with massive amounts of data and extraordinarily sophisticated algorithms so they can do big things.\u201d\nErik Linstead \u201901 is one of those scholars working with massive data sets. The senior associate dean at Fowler Engineering and principal investigator of Chapman\u2019s Machine Learning and Affiliated Technologies (MLAT) Lab cited research in pharmaceuticals to illustrate how the new computer will help facilitate advances across academic disciplines.\n\u201cWhen you look at what\u2019s going on in drug discovery right now, no one starts with in vivo research anymore \u2013 they do it in silico first, because it\u2019s so much cheaper to simulate before you do anything in the lab,\u201d Linstead said. \u201cSo, yes, in general I think the data sciences are an extremely interdisciplinary field.\u201d\nAs the new computer supercharges Chapman\u2019s research aspirations, it also strengthens the university\u2019s links to the community it serves, says Chapman President Daniele C. Struppa.\n\u201cTwo of the founding principles of the Fowler School of Engineering were to broaden access to engineering education and to deepen our ties to our local community and industry,\u201d Struppa said. \u201cThis collaboration will achieve both of those goals while simultaneously accelerating our push into AI, machine learning and cutting-edge data science research.\u201d\n\n\ncomputer engineering computer science computer technology features research supoercomputer \n\n\n\n\n \n\nDennis Arp \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Professors Get Diversity and Inclusion Grant\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Leads Conversation on California Water Supply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Family Donors Make a Collective Impact On Giving Day\u00a0 Thanks to the enthusiasm of the Chapman Family, Chapman University\u2019s fifth annual Giving Day was an unrivaled success.
