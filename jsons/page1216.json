You will learn\n\nWhich software you need to install to get your development environment ready for blocks.\nHow to use the create-block tool to speed up your block development.\nA suggested process for converting shortcodes to blocks, using the scaffolded code from create-block.\nHow to apply CSS to your blocks, both in the editor and on the front end.\nHow to implement and use block attributes to allow users to edit block data.\n\n\nThis course assumes you already have a local WordPress installation, and that you use a code editor you\u2019re familiar with. This course also expects you to have some familiarity with working in the terminal. \n\nReady to get started?
