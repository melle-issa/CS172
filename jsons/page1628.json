Photo by Chollete\n\nRom\u00e1n Zaragoza got nervous when he read the character description before his audition for the sitcom \u201cGhosts.\u201d\nAs an actor of Akimel O\u2019otham\u00a0and Mexican descent on his father\u2019s side and Japanese and Taiwanese descent on his mother\u2019s side, Zaragoza \u201921 (Cinema and Television Arts \u2013 Film)\u00a0doubted his prospects in television or film because of all the stereotypical Native American and Asian roles he found himself auditioning for \u2014 and there were so many ways\u00a0the writing for this Native character could\u2019ve gone wrong, too.\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh no, it\u2019s a show called \u2018Ghosts,\u2019 and it\u2019s a character that\u2019s Lenape\u00a0and he\u2019s from the 1500s,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201c\u2018Oh, no, they\u2019re gonna want me to have an accent and do some stereotypical thing.\u2019 But then right below, it said, \u2018Please use your normal accent.\u2019\u201d\nThat changed everything.\nThe more Zaragoza learned about the multi-dimensional character, Sasappis, and the show, the more excited he became.\nHe auditioned for the role and shot the pilot in late 2020, while in his last year at California State University, Northridge. The show was picked up in early 2021, and when he graduated, Zaragoza found himself starring on what has become one of the most popular sitcoms on TV, a hit with audiences and critics alike.\u00a0\u201cGhosts,\u201d which airs on CBS and can be streamed on Paramount+, was recently picked up for a third season.\nFor\u00a0Zaragoza,\u00a0who loved sitcoms such as \u201cHow I Met Your Mother,\u201d \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d landing a starring role on a hit network comedy is a dream come true.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, and then to be playing a character like Sass, it\u2019s been a really beautiful experience,\u201d Zaragoza said. \u201cAnd seeing how the Native community has really supported him and the story, it\u2019s really cool. I\u2019m very, very grateful and constantly just pinching myself.\u201d\nCSUN\u2019s film program in the Mike Curb College of Arts, Media, and Communication intentionally makes space for voices that historically haven\u2019t been fairly represented on TV and in films. The program is designed to give students experiences in a lot of industry roles, said\u00a0Jared Rappaport, chair of CSUN\u2019s Department of Cinema and Television Arts (CTVA).\n\u201cWe pride ourselves on developing new talents, with new voices going out in the industry,\u201d Rappaport said. \u201cWe look at ourselves as the CTVA family. So, when our students succeed in Hollywood \u2014 we have a lot of success stories \u2014 we\u2019re very proud of what they\u2019ve accomplished.\u201d\nZaragoza is already using his voice to help ensure respectful representation in his projects, and he plans to continue telling stories in a variety of ways as his career unfolds. He has starred on stage and screen and successfully ventured into directing and producing.\n\u201cCSUN definitely gave me the tools and the space to tell my own stories,\u201d he said.\nA Three-Dimensional Ghost\nRoman Zaragoza as Sasappis on \u201cGhosts.\u201d Photo: Bertrand Calmeau/CBS\n\n\u201cGhosts\u201d stars Rose McIver and Utkarsh Ambudkar as a young couple who inherit a haunted estate that they turn into a bed-and-breakfast. Many of the people who died on the property are stuck there as a sort of purgatory \u2014 among others, Sasappis haunts the property alongside the ghosts of a Viking, a Prohibition-era singer, a hippie who tried to hug a bear, and a \u201cfinance bro\u201d who died without pants on (and now spends eternity without them).\nSasappis \u2014 shortened to \u201cSass,\u201d and that\u2019s\u00a0Zaragoza\u2019s preferred spelling of the nickname \u2014 has a dry wit and a love for pizza. He\u2019s a talented storyteller, a\u00a0hopeless romantic and a bit of a troublemaker. After being stuck on the property for hundreds of years, he creates drama out of boredom, such as when he discovered one character\u2019s secret crush on another and told everyone almost instantly.\nWhile there\u2019s much more progress to be made, Sass arrived at a moment when Native representation has increased in front of and behind the camera \u2014 Zaragoza cited the TV shows \u201cReservation Dogs\u201d and \u201cRutherford Falls,\u201d as well as the \u201cPredator\u201d movie prequel \u201cPrey.\u201d\nThe \u201cGhosts\u201d showrunners invited Zaragoza\u2019s input on the best ways to craft respectful representation on their show. At his suggestion, they hired a Lenape consultant, Joe Baker. A writer on staff, John Timothy, is\u00a0Muskogee Creek.\nIn a season two episode, Sass wants to save an old tree on the property that has personal significance to him. The episode ends with a land acknowledgement, including a discussion about why they\u2019re important.\n\u201cThe show works because it\u2019s not only funny, but it also makes you feel things,\u201d Zaragoza said. \u201cIt\u2019s so healing. There are so many messages and storylines where we dive into death and love and family and loss. I just love the messages.\u201d\nThe land acknowledgement episode was particularly meaningful to Zaragoza, who was active in CSUN\u2019s American Indian Student Association, took American Indian Studies classes, and attended the campus\u2019 annual Powwow to celebrate American Indian communities of Los Angeles and greater Southern California. In 2020, following conversations between the Fernande\u00f1o Tataviam Band of Mission Indians and CSUN faculty and administrators, CSUN began publicly acknowledging the Sesevitam, the first people of this ancestral and unceded territory of Sesevenga, which is now occupied by the university, and the Sesevitam descendants who are citizens of the\u00a0Tataviam Band.\u00a0Students advocated for additional recognition efforts on campus.\nAfter graduation,\u00a0Zaragoza\u00a0also hosted a video podcast for the American Indian Student Association, interviewing Indigenous artists such as writer Stephen Graham Jones, \u201cSpirit Rangers\u201d creator and showrunner\u00a0Karissa Valencia,\u00a0and his sister, recording artist Raye Zaragoza. (Rom\u00e1n\u2019s directing credits include some of her music videos.)\n\u201cI\u2019m always excited to see the relationship between universities and Indigenous nations,\u201d he said.\n\u2018Your Voice Matters\u2019\nRom\u00e1n Zaragoza as Usnavi in a CSUN Department of Theatre production of \u201cIn the Heights.\u201d Photo by Anneka Bunnag.\n\nZaragoza grew up in New York City, the son of actor Gregory Zaragoza and business professor Shirley Zaragoza. He moved to Los Angeles with his family at age 11 when his older sister, Danielle, got into UCLA. He thought he would follow in her footsteps, but he didn\u2019t get into UCLA. CSUN accepted him, and it turned out to be a terrific fit \u2014 the CTVA program is highly regarded as one of the best in the country.\nHe arrived at CSUN in 2014 and took a screenwriting class his freshman year, and he set his mind to learning to direct as well. In spring 2017, he played the lead role of Usnavi in the Department of Theatre\u2019s production of \u201cIn the Heights\u201d at The Soraya.\n\u201cMy freshman year I just really learned, \u2018Your voice matters,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful for the experiences I had there. It was definitely one of those parts of my life where I felt very lost, and then CSUN really helped me find what I wanted and where I wanted to go.\u201d\nZaragoza also had honed his acting chops in high school. At 15, he joined\u00a0Native Voices at the Autry, an equity theatre company at the Autry Museum of the American West that develops and produces works by Native artists. Zaragoza\u2019s role in the Native Voices show \u201cOff the Rails\u201d led him\u00a0to\u00a0eventually taking a three-year break from CSUN, as the show was selected for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.\nReturn to CSUN\nHe returned to CSUN in August 2020, joining an unfamiliar cohort of classmates on Zoom.\nHe was one of three producers on the senior film project \u201cThis Is Their Land,\u201d written and directed by classmate Michael O\u2019Leary \u201921 (Cinema and Television Arts \u2013 Film). The film is about the Modoc leader known as Captain Jack, and his tense peace negotiations with\u00a0the U.S. Army in his ancestral homeland\u00a0in Northern California and Southern Oregon, during the Modoc War of 1872-73.\nZaragoza filled a wide range of roles on the project, including helping to ensure a respectful telling of the story. He helped with casting, making connections with the descendants of the Modoc people depicted in the film, and finding a translator who could translate much of the script into the traditional Mukluk language.\nZaragoza also has a small role in the film. His father, who has starred on Broadway and appeared in many movies and TV shows \u2014 including \u201cYellowstone\u201d and an episode of \u201cGhosts\u201d in which he plays Sass\u2019s father \u2014 also appears in the short film.\n\u201cThis Is Their Land\u201d has been screened at festivals and also\u00a0will\u00a0get its pandemic-delayed CSUN celebration, at the\u00a0CTVA 31st Senior Film\u00a0Showcase\u00a0(2021 Redux)\u00a0on May 3.\nZaragoza said he hopes to one day\u00a0start a production company with friends he made at CSUN.\n\u201cThere\u2019s just really talented people that came out of that program,\u201d\u00a0Zaragoza said.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m very grateful for the program and all the friends I made from it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n American Indian Student Association, American Indian Studies, American Indian Studies Program, Cinema and Television Arts, CSUN American Indian Studies, Department of Cinema and Television Arts, Featured\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n\n\n\nCSUN Success Story: How Malachia Hoover\u2019s Time as a Matador Put Her on the Path to Saving Lives\n\n\nStudying Away \u2013 Get to Know the International and Exchange Student Center\n\n\nNew Tech and a Sense of Community: CSUN\u2019s Assistive Technology Conference Celebrates 38 Years\n\n\nCSUN to host multimedia performance that explores climate change\n\n\nTribal Leader, Philanthropist and Acclaimed Author to Receive Honorary Doctorates from CSUN\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u2190 Tribal Leader, Philanthropist and Acclaimed Author to Receive Honorary Doctorates from CSUN\nCSUN to host multimedia performance that explores climate change \u2192\n\n\n\n\n Top Stories\n\n\n\nFeatured Tag\n\n\n\n\n\n \u2018Ghosts\u2019 Stories: On a Hit TV Show, CSUN Alum Uses His Voice\non April 26, 2023in Alumni, Arts and Culture\n\n\n Tribal Leader, Philanthropist and Acclaimed Author to Receive Honorary Doctorates from CSUN\non April 25, 2023in Alumni, Community, CSU News, CSUN Events, Education, Faculty and Staff News, Graduation Ceremony, Honors & Awards, Media Releases, University News\n\n\n CSUN Breaks Ground on Autodesk Technology Engagement Center, a Project with National Impact\non April 24, 2023in Donor Profile, Giving\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCSU Resources CSU Leader\nCSYouCSU News\n\nTopicsArts and Culture\nAthletics\nBusiness\nCommunity\nCSU News\nEducation\nFaculty and Staff News\nHealth and Fitness\nMedia Releases\nPolitics and Society\nScience and Technology\n CSUN in the News\n\nCalifornia State University Northridge President Dr. Erika D.
