I would see large groups of students walking together and professors holding meetings with current and past students outside, or at the campus Starbucks. I remember being amazed at the community and thinking, \u2018I really want to go there.\u2019\u201d\nThis exposure occurred when Hernandez was still in high school, working in Chapman\u2019s Student Union. Her time on campus left an impression, but it wasn\u2019t enough to make her apply.\nDiscover the Chapman Transfer Admission Guarantee for Future Educators\n\u00a0\u201cIt was never my plan to go to a four-year college,\u201d she says. \u201cIt felt financially out of reach.\u201d\nSo she enrolled at Santiago Canyon College (SCC), focusing her studies on education. But when one of her Santiago Canyon professors happened to also be a Chapman graduate student, thoughts of Chapman\u2019s campus and community came flooding back.\u00a0\nShe began talking to her counselors and professors about Chapman, and learned about the Chapman Transfer Admission Guarantee (C-TAG) for Future Educators program, which is specially designed for future elementary and special education teachers from Santa Ana College and Santiago Canyon College.\nHernandez completed the transfer pathway courses, and after graduating with an associate\u2019s degree from SCC, transferred to Chapman in fall of 2021.\u00a0\n\u201cThe transfer staff was incredibly supportive,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone who had gone to a four-year college. It was new to me, but I knew I had people in my corner. I couldn\u2019t be happier for myself.\u201d\nA first-generation college student, Hernandez credits the generous scholarships Chapman offered and her on-campus part-time job with enabling her to enroll at Chapman.\nReflecting on her time in the C-TAG program, Hernandez says that it\u2019s a close-knit, supportive program.\u00a0\n\u201cWe all support each other academically. And hang out in the Cross-Cultural Center between classes. And the professors are amazing at inspiring conversation.\u201d\nA Supportive Community for Transfer Students\nChapman welcomes transfer students in the fall and spring semesters.\n\u201cThis allows transfer students to enter at different times into the university and, in some cases, come in prior to their junior year in college,\u201d\u00a0 says Director of Admissions Shannon Crogan. \u201cOnce at Chapman, we offer one-on-one course advising for new transfer students, an orientation program specific to transfer students, as well as university housing options for those that are interested in having a residential experience.\u201d\nAs for Hernandez, she begins student teaching next spring and hopes to pursue a master\u2019s in education at \u2013 where else? \u2013 Chapman. Her long-term goal is to be a professor and teach future educators.\u00a0\nHer advice for future transfer students is \u201cto ask questions, communicate and connect with others.You would not believe how it will benefit you in your personal life and career path.\u201d\nAbove all else, she wants to encourage students to \u201cjust do it,\u201d if they\u2019re considering applying as a transfer student.\nFor more information on how you can have a successful transfer experience, visit our Transfer FAQ page, or contact us at transfers@chapman.edu or (714) 997-6711.\n\n\nAttalah College of Educational Studies CTAG First generation student first-generation college students Transfer student transfer students \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJennifer Winfield \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Orleans Interterm Course Provides 15 Years of Perspective on Crisis Response\n\n\n\n\n\nStruppa Looks Back at Past Successes, Illuminates \u2018Our Path to Greatness\u2019 in State of the University Address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership That Spans the Campus Jack of all trades Kyle Tanimura is leaving quite the lasting mark on Chapman, where he has taken on multiple leadership roles as a double major in political science and strategic and corporate communication, with a...\n\n\nMay 1, 2023 Jennifer Winfield\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Pacific Islander Desi American Heritage Month Events at Chapman University Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Heritage Month, which runs from May 1 to 31, celebrates the identities, histories and experiences of the APIDA community.
