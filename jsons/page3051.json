The need for an elegant, well-architected personal publishing system was clear even then. Today, WordPress is built on PHP and MySQL, and licensed under the GPLv2. It is also the platform of choice for over 43% of all sites across the web.\nThe WordPress open source project has evolved in progressive ways over time\u2014supported by skilled, enthusiastic developers, designers, scientists, bloggers, and more. WordPress provides the opportunity for anyone to create and share, from handcrafted personal anecdotes to world-changing movements.\nPeople with a limited tech experience can use it \u201cout of the box\u201d, and more tech-savvy folks can customize it in remarkable ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nour mission\n\n\nWordPress is designed for everyone.\nWe believe great software should work with minimum set up, emphasizing accessibility, performance, security, and ease of use. The basic WordPress software is simple and predictable, offering powerful features for growth and success.\nWordPress is open source software.\nSupporting the idea of democratizing publishing and the freedoms that come with open source, is a large community of people collaborating on and contributing to this project.\nWordPress is welcoming and inclusive.\nOur contributors\u2019 passion drives the success of WordPress which, in turn, helps you reach your goals. WordPress contributors work around the globe, and have dedicated countless hours to build a tool that offers anyone a voice.\n\n\n\n\nthe four freedoms\n\n\n\nWordPress is licensed under the General Public License (GPLv2 or later) which provides four core freedoms:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\nThe freedom to run the program for any purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nThe freedom to study how the program works and change it to make it do what you wish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nThe freedom to redistribute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nThe freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe technology\nLearn about WordPress, where it\u2019s been, and where it\u2019s going.\n\nRequirements \u2197\ufe0e\nFeatures \u2197\ufe0e\nSecurity \u2197\ufe0e\nRoadmap \u2197\ufe0e\nHistory \u2197\ufe0e\n\n\n\nthe details\nDive into the background details, like the GPL and other policies.\n\nDomains \u2197\ufe0e\nGNU Public License \u2197\ufe0e\nAccessibility \u2197\ufe0e\nPrivacy Policy \u2197\ufe0e\nStatistics \u2197\ufe0e\n\n\n\nthe people\nLearn about the community, how we get along and show our pride.\n\nPhilosophy \u2197\ufe0e\nEtiquette \u2197\ufe0e\nSwag \u2197\ufe0e\nLogos and Graphics \u2197\ufe0e\nPeople of WordPress \u2197\ufe0e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAboutNewsHostingDonateSwag\nDocumentationDevelopersGet InvolvedLearn\nShowcasePluginsThemesPatterns\nWordCampWordPress.TVBuddyPressbbPress\nWordPress.comMattPrivacyPublic Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWordPress.org\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWordPress.org\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nVisit our Facebook page\nVisit our Twitter account\nVisit our Instagram account\nVisit our LinkedIn account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
