Um, so it makes it really nice to stream YouTube. Um, okay, sosession 10. Now turn off YouTube. Um, so session 10, we\u2019re talking, um, last week we saidwe\u2019re good on the version for Crop Dotted Express, and we had saw a new direction with theproject you had been working on anyway. Mm-hmm. And we spent some time just privatelydiscussing that.And so, um, we were just chatting in the pre-roll before this about okay is, you know, building itin public, but we\u2019re, we\u2019ve pa not paused, we\u2019ve put a bow on that one and said, okay, there\u2019ssomething else here. And now it\u2019s time to kind of explore that and figure out what\u2019s, what couldthat product be. [00:01:00] Um, you just had a couple really good, um, comments about thatwhole process of here\u2019s that one, but we\u2019re going onto this next one.Hmm. Can you share some of that you\u2019re just sharing with me? Cause I think it\u2019s really goodand I don\u2019t want to Sure. Oh, your butcher, you\u2019re your top.Corey Maass: Um, so, uh, for the sake of accountability, I do wanna say that Crop express, uh,is pending a read me update that you and I worked on, I think last time. And there are a coupleof tweaks to make to the product itself.The plugin itself. To in fact put a bow on it cuz I wanted it. It\u2019s gonna be, you know, so, so a littledigression here. It\u2019s very easy for, uh, any product team as we now are to go, uh, that wasyesterday\u2019s new shiny, [00:02:00] today\u2019s new shinies over there. Um, and if we are notabandoning crop express, which we are not, then it\u2019s important that I sit down at some point andactually put a bow on it.And we don\u2019t just keep saying we\u2019re gonna put a bow on it and let it ride, but, um, you know, letit be a whole product unto itself. I think that\u2019s important. So that\u2019s on my list. Um, but yeah, we,in, in the process of talking about crop express and where the value add is, um, one of thethings that you talked about really well, um, is the, Difference between, you had a little graphicthat, you know, pain solving a pain versus adding value.Um, and obviously these things are not mutually exclusive by any stretch, but, um, crop Expresssolved a problem for us. That\u2019s why, why we started the conversation in the first place. I built thislittle web utility. You went, holy crap, this [00:03:00] needs to be in WordPress. Uh, and thatlaunched our journey, but we kept having these great meta conversations about image imagesin WordPress as a whole.And one of the things, problems that I\u2019ve been struggling with for a while, for my own blog andagain for, um, client sites, not only is it cropping images correctly, which solves a pain point,ideally, um, but is you write a blog post and, and then what? Right. You need other assets to goalong with it. Uh, and then in a perfect, you know, so we\u2019re talking, now we\u2019re talking aboutmarketing, right?We\u2019re talking about marketing assets, things to put on Twitter, images to put on Twitter imagesto put on Instagram, and, and having to go over to Canva to do that or some other tool. Um, andso now we\u2019re talking [00:04:00] about that, which is, you know, there is pain involved. These areextra steps, but it\u2019s the difference between, to me, you know, the difference between trying towrite a, a basic blog post with an image inward press, and that it\u2019s.You get to the end of the words and you\u2019re like, oh, this is such a pain. I need to do somethingwith an image and leave WordPress. Versus traditionally, I think we\u2019d write a blog post inWordPress and then go, okay, the WordPress part is done. Now let me jump over to Canva,Photoshop, whatever it is to generate these other images.Um, and so now we\u2019re sort of switching over to a value add potentially.Cory Miller: Yeah. I, um, most of my product experience is in the pain threshold. Um, you know,backup, security, all that, you know, updating stuff, very [00:05:00] utilitarian, um, practicalthings, and I really appreciate it. That\u2019s part of my personality too. I like utility things. You know,there\u2019s this pin, for instance, is the big. A pin.And in my belief, there\u2019s no other better pin than this pin. So I take \u2019em from everywhere thathas \u2019em, that gives \u2019em out. And I promote all Napa Valley Winery. Um, so I, I\u2019m practical in that\nutilitarian, like, do something for you. And it was great to see some of the products, like peoplejust, they needed it, you know?Um, I always aspired to the ones that help people look good, make money, all that. And we builtthose into those products for sure, where people could use those things and what labeled themor package them into a bigger thing. And so a lot of the products were very utility products, butthe marketing and things we did was very aspirational.Um, [00:06:00] this one so interesting because you had already been working on something andyou showed it to me and I was like, oh, wow. And. As I can do anything, I can blow somethingreal big up, you know? And that\u2019s what we did. We, wow. The compelling thing was, you know,I\u2019ll take some of the marketing tools, like for instance, uh, the one I just kind of default to think ofis Optum Monster.Hmm. When you see what, whatever time they came out with the Optum Monster, um, whenyou see that a popup and what they, what you could do with that, you instantly kind of go, ohwow, I could do that too. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s really compelling for me. Um mm-hmm. When you\u2019reable to show an outcome that people go, I mean, it\u2019s marketing product for sure.It helps you build your email, um, email list. It helps you potentially, [00:07:00] uh, get somepurchases from coupons and things like that. Not to go into the full thing about Optum Monster,but. You go right there, you can see what the product does. Mm-hmm. And if you don\u2019t havethat, you can go, wow, this could make, make it easier.What\u2019s compelling about what you said was, or what we, we, you showed me is this, one of themany things we talked about was the social images, being able to, you write your post and thenyou\u2019re, you\u2019re ready to promote it and like you said, go to Cam and do all these things. Um, Ithink in this conversation, what I\u2019ve kinda learned from Crop Drive Express and then past stuff isparticularly with this idea, we can give that aha oh wow moment for someone.And we talked about using it on some of our client sites, post status and different things. Um,because then when you see. That\u2019s where I [00:08:00] think, you know, when they seesomething going out that has a nice treatment, um, yeah. Where it\u2019s not just a link. I mean,that\u2019s what I tend to do personally. Um, then I think there\u2019s, there\u2019s some merit there of you wantyour base hub to be your website and they\u2019re promoting outs through your social channels, andthen those to look appealing and good, whether it\u2019s Facebook, Instagram, whatever those thingsare.Yeah. Um, and kinda lead back. And that\u2019s where I go. I\u2019ll tell you, I in this, in this whole projectthat we\u2019ve been working on together, it just keep, I keep coming back to you and I talked aboutour, at our product owners meet up this week. Um, getting as close as you can to the pain that apotential customer has, um, or that desire to do for them to look better, make more money.\nUm, I don\u2019t know. This is the work I need to do more is getting closer to that, you know? Mm-hmm. Where it\u2019s not just theory, us talking, it\u2019s like, [00:09:00] you know, do, is this an issue?\nAnd there\u2019s, um, you know, a book out called the Mom Test and mm-hmm. The thing is, whenyou have an idea and you go to your mom, she\u2019s always gonna say, I love it.Yeah. So making it in a way where it\u2019s more discovery. But that\u2019s my thoughts about this and Iwanna be sure because this is a bigger project. Um, I guess the word would be validating. Yep.Is there a pain point? Is there someone willing to, to, to pay for it? Um, so we\u2019re really taking it. Iknow we approached this as a hobby, but going, okay, give our best effort to make this intosomething that actually does pay us my thought.Corey Maass: Yeah. . And that was, and that was, I think, part of why, so I don\u2019t remember thesummary to, to, we\u2019re on session 10. So in session eight, I think we, we, the conversation cameto a point where we said, okay, so, so [00:10:00] cropping images is one piece of the puzzle ofconsistent, good looking images on a WordPress site.That could be a blog, that could be WooCommerce, whatever, right? Um, and so we were stillsort of solving, um, yeah, we were solving a basic problem. Um, again, a p a a point of pain that,uh, we had. Um, I\u2019m, I\u2019m trying, in my brain, I keep drawing this analogy of, um, a basic car, yourHonda Civic from, I, my first Honda Civic, uh, that I bought in 2015 was from 2000.So 15 year old, you know, but in good shape. But it would get you there, but no bells andwhistles. The, the crank windows, the whole thing, right? And so, um, and, and a lot of people, Ithink this was a, you know, more traditionally [00:11:00] WordPress as a blog platform was thatfor a lot of people, I\u2019m gonna put words out.\nMaybe people find it or they don\u2019t. I\u2019m gonna tell my friends about it along come social media,uh, and, and other paradigms and, and the things go from, I guess you sort of hope for inbound,you know, and we\u2019re talking about amateurs or, or non-professionals is the better word, right?But, um, you know, to outbound.And then also I think there\u2019s an expectation now, or most people blog for money, right? Mostpeople publish for money. Most people use WordPress for money a lot more than back in theday when it was, you know, express yourself or put yourself online or, or, you know, buildauthority, all those things. Um, and so taking that, uh, your, the, the bigger problem that we,when we talked about with crop express of consistent [00:12:00] images and putting yourself outthere, and it\u2019s like we\u2019re talking about, um, Individuality, right?So it\u2019s not just cropping finding a, finding a, a stock photo one for each post, right? Or each, um,product image. If you\u2019ve, if you\u2019re running Woo commerce, it\u2019s like, yeah, it\u2019s a square. Okay, it\u2019s,I sell, you know, this widget and that widget, and I crop them all to be squares. But it\u2019s like, dothose images stand out?Do those images have more information? So it\u2019s like, if I go to the website, there\u2019s all theinformation next to a photo. But on Twitter, if I put that photo up and it\u2019s just a picture of awidget, it doesn\u2019t list the benefits. It doesn\u2019t, you know, so it\u2019s not, um, a compelling bigger, andthis is where, you know, um, I think one of the things that really clicked for me was you sent me.The, on the, on the post status blog, one of the threads there is, or tags or something is, youknow, here are all the [00:13:00] people we\u2019ve featured. And I was like, wait, all of these bannerimages not only are the same size, but they\u2019ve all got the same treatment. They all have thepost status logo on the left. Um, you know, and we look at, and that, and that, that solidifiedsomething for me that you\u2019d touched on, but I, I couldn\u2019t relate to as much.Like, you, you really liked slides, um, and talked about using slides again to promote things.And, and we sort of went, wow, what if, you know, you have, um, uh, your product images, youor your, your, your blog post banner, image featured image, um, that had bullet points on it or,you know, so it was like taking these, I guess what I\u2019m trying to do is summarize, um, veryspecifically, A little bit of how we got here, but also what we\u2019re now talking about, right?So we\u2019re talking about image treatment, image generation, um, based around one post quoteunquote [00:14:00] post, which in WordPress can be a product, can be a blog post, can be anarticle, can be your course if you\u2019re running an l m s, whatever it is. Um, and so that\u2019s kind ofthe, the switch from solving a pain point, cropping an image to this huge value add.And it\u2019s like, and I guess, yeah, uh, it\u2019s, it\u2019s coming together in my head. You brought in opt,brought up Optum Monster. So it\u2019s like you could have a website, you could have great content.Optin Monster is this value add. If your end goal is promotion, money, fame, and fortune, all thatkind of stuff, being a reality TV star, um, optin Monster is this great.You know, the going from, from your Honda Civic to the, the sport version, and then the fins andthe, you know, so now suddenly you\u2019ve got, you know, you\u2019ve gone from a basic way to publishcontent to, you know, bells and [00:15:00] whistles essentially. Um, which isn\u2019t to diminish it likebells and whistles are often it\u2019s, um, not it\u2019s, it\u2019s said in a condescending way or a bad way, butwe\u2019re talking about like, okay, how can you, you know, make the, the basic car that gets youfrom A to B be a fun experience, that kind of thing.Um, enough restraining the metaphors. The point is, um, yeah, OptinMonster adds this extravalue and whatnot. So it\u2019s like if we have, uh, if you write a blog post, what we\u2019re talking aboutdoing is, is. A product in WordPress that can generate slides, can generate images, could cropthe image, but also could add potentially a, a graphical treatment.Um, so it\u2019s always got a blue fade or it\u2019s always got a logo on the left, or it\u2019s always got, and, andthese things would be auto-generated. Um, so you, you finish your post, you click a button and[00:16:00] you\u2019ve got an image for Twitter, an image for Facebook, an image that you know, Imean, taking this to a, um, an extreme no idea if we can yet, if we can do this, but, um, anim ancreating an animated gift that has three slides that go by or, you know, things, so things youcould upload to Instagram.You know, if it\u2019s an animated gif it should be, we could create an MP4 out of it and then it\u2019s, um,a story for Instagram cuz it\u2019s a video and da da da. So all these, all these shareable assets,which again, take that basic blog post and just blow it up to, to create all these amazing thingsthat you could then do something with.\nUm, when we came to, when we were starting to talk about that as a product in our previous callor previous previous call, that was when I said, okay, let\u2019s have a conversation offline cuz I thinkmaybe I\u2019ve got a solution for this. Um, so in [00:17:00] parallel, for a few months now, um, I built.Little SAS app, basically web service, um, called screenshot.express and haven\u2019t launched it.That was if, if you follow me on Twitter, or I think I might have mentioned here too, like this is aproduct that I built, um, and the a p I works, it works as a, is a little screenshotting platform. Um,but what I really wanted it for was, yes, it\u2019s great for taking a screenshot of a website, but if itcan take a picture of, of, of a website.But that website could be the size and shape of a Twitter banner or, you know, could be a, um, aslide. Then we\u2019re now talking about using H T M L to, to define a layout. Whatever we want thatto look like. And then taking pictures of it. And then there you\u2019ve got your image and so, and CRand [00:18:00] generating different types of H T M L pages and also taking advantage of res, theresponsiveness of, of layout.So it\u2019s like if you have a header and some text next to each other, but on mobile, the he, theheader goes above the text with one H T M L output. You take two pictures, one wide and onenarrow. You\u2019ve now got a, uh, a Twitter banner and you know, a mobile screenshot or whatever.So it\u2019s like, I realized that in parallel, I\u2019ve already got this little service that will potentially solvethe technical aspect of this.Um, and so that was where sort of all this came together and we went, wow, that\u2019s, that to me isa much bigger thing. Um, and so as you said at the, the beginning of my ramble, like, we seethis as a, as a much bigger product to me, right away my gut says, okay, that\u2019s much more of a,something we could sell. You know, it\u2019s, [00:19:00] it\u2019s a big packageable thing.Whereas crop Express, it was like, this is a great little utility. It solves a neat little problem. Andwe could probably keep adding some things or, or splashing around in the problem until wefound something that would, people pay, would pay a little bit for. Um, but this to me seems likesomething much bigger.Cory Miller: Yeah, for sure. And I don\u2019t, um, my tendency is always like, oh, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go.And I\u2019m trying to really not do that because I, I wanna be careful, you, you in particular. Me too.But you, um, as a developer on the partner, um, and lead on this, I, I wanna be really carefulwith the time. Mm-hmm. Um, because I, I think we both go, we did something of value here, andI wanna be a little bit more calculated than I have in the past about Okay.Because I can blow these ideas up and go, okay, I see these, what I don\u2019t wanna do is just dothat in a [00:20:00] vacuum. Um, not to like you and I are doing this, but I, I want to, I feel likethere\u2019s something so powerful of getting to whatever the person is trying to do, like havingsomebody in mind, or talking to people and seeing what they.Talk about it\u2019s, it\u2019s funny. So with product at post status, I go, just to give you kind of a parallelabout how I\u2019ve historically think about product and need to change and, and evolve, is I go,okay, for our agency, we, we saw real quickly becoming an owner post status that, um, okay,product people, smaller group of people than you got hosting companies, you haveprofessionals that do all the work.But I really honed in on, there\u2019s a lot of WordPress agencies out there, and I don\u2019t see in thisspace a lot of people that there are really cool companies doing really high-end work foragencies like [00:21:00] Troy, Dean\u2019s work, um, uro, different things like that. But I go, okay, I,for me, Passion and ability and go.I\u2019d love to promote and help people tell stories and draw expertise. So long story short, besidesjust Slack and e and our email newsletter, I think we can offer more to them. Where I\u2019m at in thatproduct is really interesting for me. Frustrating. I shouldn\u2019t say interesting. I don\u2019t wanna sayinteresting.It\u2019s frustrating as hell is I go, we could do mar co-marketing for these agencies. Now you knowhow it is, you bring in an idea to somebody else. It\u2019s so different from the my uh, the, my big FatGreek wedding when he goes, you have to make it his idea. And I go, oh, that\u2019s so true with metoo. But, but I go, if you get to customer and see what they\u2019re doing, um, potential customer andjust talk.So like in my interviews with the agency owners, one of the things they stand up, but I[00:22:00] think there\u2019s a bias cause I\u2019m coming at as post status. Um, and one of the featureswe\u2019ve had in our products is job listings. I go. That\u2019s what they tend to have gravitated toward it.\nAnd I go, well, I don\u2019t know what more else we could potentially offer in that, but keep gettingpros in there.And so that\u2019s like existing product, just trying to make it better, which is valid foundational. Iwanted to do more for them. Now this is where we\u2019re in that process and, but I don\u2019t want it tobe like, I got this cool idea. Cuz then you\u2019re kind of just striking trying to try to hit a hit, a hit awinning lado.Um, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m at, you know? And, um, with this my mind went to, oh, I mean we, wewere talking about our own problems right now, and then we\u2019re using some clients and differentthings to think about that. But before we go, I wanna make sure [00:23:00] specifically first andforemost on your behalf is we. Gets some validation.A little spark of something. Yeah. And collect enough sparks that go, this could be a fire. Right?This could be, I just, I wanna do that cuz my tendency is I\u2019m an DF fair and you know, I dr at theopportunity to work with a great developer like yourself and, and product person like yourself.And, uh, so anyway, that\u2019s where my mind tends to go.But this is interesting to both of us. Um, now it\u2019s like if you got a hammer, everything looks like,like a nail. Uh, I wanna be careful of that in this.Corey Maass: Yeah, sure. And I tend to build first and ask questions later. We know this, so,which isCory Miller: freaking cool. I think that\u2019s better. See, it would be better as an idea person to beable to build it first too.Right. And say, but I just, I wanna be careful cause I don\u2019t have those skillsets.\nCorey Maass: Well, and, and this one is, I think one of the other things I mentioned in the pre-roll is [00:24:00] this is a much bigger lift. Yeah. And so I\u2019m also, my brain is saying there\u2019s, there\nare red flags here to that approach. Crop express, small, you know, crank something out, get it,you know, we, the prototype is going to be straightforward, uh, or was straightforward and, andyou coming in and going start with featured images.Great. Even simpler. So we\u2019ve got one and it turned out to be replicable. So then media library,um, block, um, we did have to hire somebody to get us over a couple of hurdles, but for themost part, Replicable, um, reusable code and all at once. Whereas this, I mean, so I alreadystarted my intention of spinning up screenshot express, which is abstract.And I knew that. I\u2019m like, this is probably isn\u2019t a thing. I\u2019m gonna, [00:25:00] I\u2019m, I\u2019m gonna sellon its own. There are, and there are people who are making progress with, with other productsthat take screenshots. And I admire that because I\u2019m like, this is a, this is a service. This is a,this a hundred percent a solution looking for a problem.And so it\u2019ll be other developers or me as a developer that uses this tool for whatever problem.And so it\u2019s like the, I said about building a, a WordPress plugin, which I think you and I shouldreview and start pulling apart and see what we can do with, um, But it\u2019s, uh, to generate socialimages to accompany a post.Um, and so the good news is, yeah, I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve solved some of the, like, some of the problems,like, what do I wanna say, as a product, it\u2019s more complicated and involving a third party service,like screenshot.express is more complicated. And [00:26:00] then setting up different images fordifferent use cases is complicated.And, uh, and solving the right problems is complicated. It\u2019s like you go to Canva, they\u2019ve got like,not only do they have all the assets and stuff, but they\u2019ve got a gajillion templates. What do youwanna make today? I wanna make an Instagram post. I wanna make a, you know, a musicvideo. I wanna make a dot, dot dot.Like all these things. So somebody had to sit down and, and make templates out of all thosethings. Um, and so it\u2019s building, this is going, you know, as already. Even though I\u2019ve solvedsome of the problems connecting to the p i of Screenshot express and stuff is like, all of that ismore complicated, a much more complicated user experience.Um, before we even get to the fun part of like, okay, now we can just build a gajillion templatesand hope that one of them is the right thing and, and, and on and on. So, um, so yeah, it, itstrikes me that you doing more interviews, re more research, [00:27:00] um, us getting moreanswers, um, before I, like, I\u2019m, I\u2019m inclined to, I keep waiting for you to say, like you saying,featured image early on was such a pivotal point, like, here\u2019s how we simplify this big,complicated thing to start with.\nUm, so no pressure, but I\u2019m waiting for you to come up with that again. Um, but I do think thatsince I\u2019ve got, since I\u2019m close to having s a, an initial. Social image generator plugin forwardWordPress using Screenshot express that maybe we start there cuz it does solve the problem.Um, enough for us to, for, for you to get eyes on it as far as user experience and go, yeah, no,this is, you\u2019ve made it as you, Corey have made it as simple as possible.It\u2019s good enough. You know, we can, we can [00:28:00] tolerate people, people will toleratestepping through this pro progress process, even though it\u2019s a handful of steps to get the valuethat we are creating at the end. Um, and then, and we keep having these conversations like wedid with Crop Express, where we go, okay, wait, but if we put this over here, it makes moresense in context.Or if we mm-hmm. You know, connected to a different service or we put it in front of certainkinds of people, um, then. It\u2019ll take us, it\u2019ll take us to it. It\u2019ll help us grow.Cory Miller: Yeah. Uh, I just asked ChatGPT what are the most popular features of Canva?Hmm. So that, that\u2019s interesting. Um, excuse me, because we\u2019ve mentioned that a number oftimes and different photo editing tool.Um, I think so two parts, making sure I really understand what Screenshotted Express can do atthe moment. Um, [00:29:00] but two, I think in this next experiment is having, having a defaultcustomer in mind. Yeah. And, you know, sizing that market, the, the person that we know, thatwe think we understand or have some connections with.And then seeing how that market is. Because it cur, it occurs to me like I told you with backupbuddy. I go, well, that\u2019s a hundred percent. Theoretically, theoretically, everyone should want a,a backup for their WordPress site, right? Um, that was easy, right? Because the, you know,we\u2019re gonna go into this field and we\u2019re gonna hit something.Um,Corey Maass: But to, but I think to your point, like your average non nerd or non-professionaldoesn\u2019t think about that. You know, there\u2019s a reason why they are automatically that mosthosting companies [00:30:00] offer automatic backups. And even if they don\u2019t, I almost canguarantee that they\u2019re doing at least some periodic, because the majority of their support ticketsare, I broke my site, or somebody hacked my site.What? And I, you know, and, and support. A technician comes back and says, great, whatabout, what do you have for backups? And the person goes, what\u2019s a backup? And then theygo, oh, well you are lucky on our server in a very hidden technical way. I can at least restore itfrom seven days ago or from yesterday or what have you.You know, but you should have thought about this and then mm-hmm. You know, but, but youraverage person doesn\u2019t think about backups. Right. Um, so you still, you were solving a problemthat everybody has, but most people don\u2019t know they have. Mm-hmm.Cory Miller: Yeah. And, and where when we get the main product out, we\u2019re able to do[00:31:00] content marketing around all the reasons why it would be good.We even created a content, um, content replacement calendar or something. We tried to say,what\u2019s the value of all your posts? Because I lost, uh, I lost things from my personal websitewhen we had a server crash. Now, you know, there they weren\u2019t invaluable, but it was, it was aheadache. So we started doing that to try to map that out.But, um, when we talk about avatars for a second, um, we have your clients content journey,and then the, what I hear over, and it\u2019s so interesting, my, my own perception of WordPress haschanged so much. Um, but what I hear over and over from our agencies and owners and thingsis that the people running when they deliver projects, I, it\u2019s really compelling that it\u2019s marketing[00:32:00] specific people.Mm-hmm. I just got outta the, a agency owners meetup and it was again, like they\u2019re turningsites over and typically it\u2019s marketing related type. People are actually the people using theirWordPress sites from enterprise. WordPress does really good in the enterprise becausemarketers go, it\u2019s cheaper, it\u2019s faster, and I can use it.So I, I would say like in this backup buddy thought, I go big market, I am a marketer. I go that,that\u2019s really compelling. Which is why when we talked about screenshotted express, I was likethe social images. I, but I don\u2019t, I gotta admit, make sure I\u2019m honest about this. I don\u2019t do that. Idon\u2019t really post to our website.Um, we have team and content journey and different things that do that. But if we take that a,that\u2019s one big avatar. I can like say, generally speaking, [00:33:00] if we hit the marketing room\nand that\u2019s the, the sexy make you look better, make money kind of realm. Yeah. So there\u2019s one,um, I think about yours as a lot of publishers, um, uh, publishers.But even like a lot of the content journey, you know, clients, um, it\u2019s, it kind of boils down to themarketing people. They\u2019re the ones interfacing with those clients. Yeah. Very.Corey Maass: Yep. Um, yeah, we\u2019ve got, I\u2019ve got a couple of different scenarios. One is on oneteam, we have a person dedicated to social media. Um, and I am, so, so there\u2019s an interview Iwant to have, um, customer interview, like talk to them about how they\u2019re making stuff.I think they\u2019re using Canva. Um, and I think that they\u2019ve got template set up so that, again, it\u2019s,they plug in a featured [00:34:00] image, they plug in a featured image, but it\u2019s got the sametreatment every time. Um, I want to make sure of. And I\u2019d love, we\u2019ll have you talk to them if, ifyou\u2019re following the, um, mom interview methodology.Um, cuz I\u2019d also, I think what would be really interesting would be, I have a history of taking, uh,blue ocean products and, and rebuilding them, repurposing them for WordPress. Um,sometimes with legit value and sometimes just because it\u2019s a smaller market, so it\u2019s easier tofocus. And, and I\u2019m still fascinated with the idea of WordPress being the control panel for a, aperson\u2019s entire business.Um, but I also would be curious if, you know, sorry. Um, if the people are who, if they arejumping into Canva, are they struggling? Like, is it too many choices? [00:35:00] Is it, um,repeatable? Uh, sorry, I gotta let a dog in. Hold on.Cory Miller: Go, go for it. I, I\u2019m opening up a y board to take some notes.Corey Maass: And thankfully my spouse stepped in and cornered him. Um, but yeah, it\u2019s, youknow, so is, is there value in generating these things from WordPress with the expectation that,like I just wrote, wrote a blog post, and as we talked about before, you know, there\u2019s the, the last10% or the, you know, maybe it\u2019s, let\u2019s use 80 20, right?Like 80% of what should be the process is writing a blog post. But at least in our experience,80% of the pain is. Um, the technically speaking anyway is going and finding an image,cropping [00:36:00] an image, all that kind of stuff, which is what we were trying to solve withCrop Express. And so, um, you know, is it, is it parallel here where it\u2019s like, okay, I\u2019ve written ablog post now what?And I think that that\u2019s a big problem, uh, to solve. Uh, or it\u2019s a, a question that, that we wanna becareful. We want to do a good job of defining the question to then come up with the solution.Um, and so it\u2019s, you know, our people. If, if, if we can get to the point where you\u2019ve generated ablog post, click a button, and then you\u2019ve got assets, that\u2019s amazing.Um, is that enough? How hard or difficult is it to create those assets? Because it\u2019s like Canvaoffers creativity. Right. You can do anything all the time forever. But I, for me, um, like I have amusic blog, and so every time I, [00:37:00] or one of my writers writes a review, I go into Canvaand I open exa, I open the same design, I say duplicate page.I change the title. I change the, so that it has the same treatment, right? Like, I\u2019m not doing whatCanva kind of seems to want you to do, which is starting from scratch every single time.Because I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not doing that. I\u2019m not trying to be that creative, and in fact, that takes waymore time rather than, You know, a quick, simple 32nd, copy, paste, change, title, publish.Um, and so I\u2019m, I\u2019m intrigued to find out if I\u2019m right about that. Um, mm-hmm. You know, if, if ourteam, if my teammate, somebody writes a story, publishes a story, like we have professionalwriters who are writing, um, you know, long form content, and then we\u2019ve got, again, a separate[00:38:00] person whose job it is in part to create social media content from that story to thenpublish everywhere.Um, and I\u2019d be interested to know if it\u2019s a simple process for them or, uh, the hypothesis similarto the crop express hypothesis is are they going, you know, the hard part should be. Putting allthis stuff out there, looking at the analytics, like creating a, essentially a, a mini campaign, um, topromote this blog post.But most of the pain is actually going in and, and cropping an image and adding the treatmentand all that kind of stuff. Um, and if, and if there\u2019s value in having that sit in WordPressalongside the blog post, um, you know, whether it\u2019s under media or whether it\u2019s going into thepost and then seeing a little icon that opens up an app or, you know, whatever approach it is,um, you know, to make sure that there\u2019s as much benefit there as we\u2019re [00:39:00] hoping.Cory Miller: Okay. I\u2019m trying to make sure I take all these,\num, okay. So, um, potential avatars, I think we\u2019ve said marketing. I try to put a little bit. Thinghere. We got publishers I added in here. Um, because one thing that kind of, if you, if I justcamp out in this marketing realm, um, I thought about screenshot express, and I go ebookcreation or lead magnet creation.Mm-hmm. Like the covers. Mm-hmm. Um, you know, some kind of cover. Now I think that wouldalso lend to this featured image creation in the sense of those graphics you talked about withpost status. Like we got the featured image graphic that we kind of pulled together, but it justkind of made me [00:40:00] think like outputs, maybe I should put that here.Uh, outputs,um, social images, we said this, uh, featured images, uh, oh e let me just say ebook coverage,just in the realm of possibility here. Yep.Corey Maass: Slides was the thing that got you your gears turning early on.Cory Miller: I was thinking of tip boxes. Lemme see if I can share my screen. Nope. I have toclose the Y board. I was on, uh, CAO\u2019s website looking at their di i y lighting kit and they had apullout with a tip. Oh, okay. So I, I don\u2019t know how to call, like pull out, pull out boxes and Iguess that could be quotesthey call to action. Hmm. Um, like, [00:41:00] well, let\u2019s put ads, ads into Oh yeah. Post etcetera. Wow. Yeah.Corey Maass: Wow. Wow. Ads like auto ad gener, ad ad image generator from a Woocommerce product. Mm. Holy crap.Cory Miller: That could be coupons, like mm-hmm. I, I was even thinking your HTML side, cuzyou\u2019re generating H M L and then you\u2019re taking the snapshot of it.But like, you know, Kohl\u2019s or Bed Bath and Beyond, you know, they have a coupon and it lookslike a little coupon thing. And I mean, if there\u2019s HTML, if we\u2019re generating HTML, don\u2019t even, youdon\u2019t have to go to the screenshot if you don\u2019t want to, but like, you could put that with a littledressing that kind of calls it out, so.Yep. Um,[00:42:00]okay, let me, let\u2019s do this for a second. Let\u2019s take this marketing because I think we, there\u2019s thebig market, bigger market there. It\u2019s a lot of the users. When I think about creating a blog post,I\u2019m thinking about organic search traffic primarily. Um, But so that it gets placed in the searchengine, uh, it gets ranked and then traffic comes to that page.When they get on page, then I want them to do something. This is where, you know, Optummonitor or popup thing is like compelling because it\u2019s, you get attention, like offer free offerinside, right?Corey Maass: Kind of thing. Yeah. It turns, it turns passive into, uh, there\u2019s ac there\u2019ssomething\u2019s actionable. Yeah. So it\u2019s not, don\u2019t just consume, like, and so this is where you\u2019vegot, uh, share these, bookmark these, you know, it\u2019s like, so I\u2019m reading somebody\u2019s article andyet I get a popup that says, [00:43:00] want more great content like this?Sign up. Want an ebook of related content? Sign up. Um, here, share buttons. Please share thison, you know, if you got value out of this, share this on Twitter. Um, email it to a friend. Um, butthinking in terms of, yeah, images, um, so, you know, if we\u2019re just talking content, written words,then, um, my, the featured image that you\u2019d see ideally would be stylized, something that fits inwith your site.But if you ask a guest to share this story on Twitter, big pretty image is obviously morecompelling than just a, a headline. Um, but you don\u2019t want to share the featured image becausethe featured image probably doesn\u2019t have, uh, the title of the post. Uh, it might or might not, butit certainly, what I, what I thought you, a brilliant idea you came up with was, [00:44:00] youknow, a featured image with a, or, or a shareable image, which is the featured includes thefeatured image, the title of the post, and then one or two.It could be the excerpt, it could be one or two bullet points, but, so it\u2019s like if I go to share, if Iread an article, You know, and it has a pretty image of a, some sunset and it says, best placesto retirement, retire to, okay. But if I\u2019m sharing an image on Twitter, the image that I share shouldsay the best places to retire to should have the sunset in the background.And then, you know, a, a tag, an excerpt that says the results will blow you away. Total click bait.Or, you know, the top, you know, should say the top five, Hawaii, Alaska, blah, blah, blah. Youknow, click to read the rest of \u2019em, kind of thing. So then it\u2019s, it\u2019s, um, you know, and that\u2019sdifferent from the featured image and that\u2019s different from, that\u2019s the type of thing you\u2019d run over\nto Canva and, and generate and, and maybe [00:45:00] generate in a number of different sizesand shapes to then push, you know, drag into buffer or whatever you use to schedule yoursocials or to broadcast your socials.I definitely wanna make sure we don\u2019t get into that realm. Um, Because interacting with all thoseAPIs is a nightmare, and there\u2019s a hundred of those tools already. But, um, oh, and, um, Yost, shuh, the OG image, uh, is the other one. So again, if an image that\u2019s different from you\u2019ve gotyour featured image, you go and you, you pa paste the URL into Twitter or into Slack, and youget that little preview card, that\u2019s your open graph image.Twitter now has Twitter cards, which is their version. And so again, having different, differentversions generated for all of these things. And some of this I think we can do even behind thescenes, which I think will be really, really neat. And then some of this I think could be, and thenit\u2019s like, [00:46:00] so maybe that\u2019s where, you know, we\u2019re, we\u2019re, we haven\u2019t yet talked about.I mean, we\u2019re not, we\u2019re not ready yet to talk about business models and that kind of thing, buthypothetically, a. Beginner version that just does a couple of the basic things. Here\u2019s ashareable image. Um, or here\u2019s the, the open graph image for every post, every productautomatically generated, done. Um, and that\u2019s not necessar.That\u2019s maybe something that people can set and forget kind of thing. But then we\u2019re also talkingabout, in my mind at least, we\u2019re talking about something that approaches more of a Canva kindof functionality for marketers. So it\u2019s like, yes, the, the basics are covered, the incoming stuff iscovered, or the quick share, uh, in Slack preview is covered.Um, but then talking about, you know, saying, okay, now I need the list of assets that I\u2019ve[00:47:00] predefined, I wanna slide for, um, you know, for social medias. Cuz it\u2019s like, and ifyou. If you\u2019re doing it right, air quotes, right? You are not posting about a, a blog post once youare not, uh, putting an image into or putting a product into woo commerce, tweeting about itonce and then hoping that it sells a gajillion, you are again, creating a campaign that says, okay,you know, over the next six months, tweet about this every couple of days, every then, everyfew days in it, every once a week.And you sort of, you might peter off, but there\u2019s this arc and you want those images to bepotentially to be different every time. And so it\u2019s like, could you generate a bunch of images thatthen get cued, um, you know, on all different platforms. And so it\u2019s like potentially you\u2019re talkingabout, um, oh, I think the other neat thing that you mentioned in a previous conversation waslike, Answer a few questions, [00:48:00] right?So it\u2019s like word w WordPress is already gonna ask you for an excerpt fine. But it\u2019s like, what arethree bullet points? What are two or three quotes? And then if it auto-generated a whole bunchof images that had the quotes, that had the, um, oh, you know what, uh, uh, what\u2019s analogous?Like there\u2019s, um, what\u2019s it called?Um, I have a book marked, um, avatar Image. Photo.Cory Miller: Oh, yeah. Avatars.Corey Maass: So there\u2019s, um, yeah. Avatars. And so basically kind of creating little avatarimages for, um,Cory Miller: I mean, profile cards, you know, like, right.Corey Maass: So yeah. So p fp maker.com. P fp maker mm-hmm. Profile pick maker. Is whatit\u2019s short for, right? But you upload a photo of yourself, it, it [00:49:00] strips the background out,and then it, and then it just delivers you a page full of avatars.So it\u2019s your photo over and over again, but all these different funky backgrounds. And so youscroll through them and you\u2019re like, Ooh, I like that one. I like that one. I like that one. Um, Ithink, yeah, go to my Twitter account and you\u2019ll see one, and I use this to just like, I go, I uploadthis to, we\u2019ve looked at the, um, sticker mule background remover kind of thing.Um, and I think there\u2019s, remove.bg was one that I just found recently. That\u2019s a great r l. But soit\u2019s like you create an image, you take an image of yourself, you use a tool to strip thebackground, and then you upload it here. And now you\u2019ve got, you know, a dozen or two orthree dozen different backgrounds and they\u2019ve got ones with palm trees and the Eiffel Tower,which is fun, right?But so picturing like, You know, you write a blog post, you create a new Woo commerce product,you go, you, you hit publish. And, and then, you know, our plugin essentially says, okay,[00:50:00] you\u2019re ready to create marketing assets. Um, what do you want to create today?\nTwitter, Instagram, you know, and then, great, what\u2019s, what\u2019s the headline, which we can auto,auto pull.Um, what\u2019s the excerpt? We, again, we can auto pull, um, featured image to start with, right?But maybe you wanna upload other ones. Um, what are three bullet points? What are some pullquotes? What are some benefi, you know, we can sort of customize a questionnaire that says,fill these in, generate. And then now you\u2019ve got essentially a matrix that\u2019s like, you know, animage for Twitter, an image for Facebook, an image for do, do, do, do.And going across. You\u2019ve got quote, quote, Bullet point, bullet point, bullet point, style, style,style, um, you know, light mode, dark mode, play with fonts kind of thing. Um mm-hmm. Youknow, and it, and so you suddenly, you\u2019ve got a catalog of generated relevant images designedto go on a bunch of different platforms and you\u2019d [00:51:00] go, okay, yep, this one works.This one works, this one\u2019s silly. Ignore it, you know, whatever. Um, butCory Miller: so in, yeah, so in this, um, I went to the ChatGPT my researcher Yep. And, um,image SEO came out and I was like, okay, if I\u2019m embodying, um, I\u2019m trying to do this, I\u2019mpublishing site content in order to get ranked in Google. And you get on here, if you\u2019ve done allthe work to do an SEO o keyword blog post, you\u2019re using WordPress.Great platform to do that. You go what was be one extra while you\u2019re already there to get a littlebit extra stuff. Mm-hmm. And this Image SEO thing popped up in the list that I asked. Mm-hmm.And it\u2019s kind of compelling. Um,and I read something just a second ago, uh, and I checked out your profile maker too. That\u2019ssuper cool. [00:52:00] Um, half of all Google searches end on the searcher. So wait, I\u2019m sorry. Ithought I was saying how, how big SEO image SEO is, but we\u2019re kind of saying that with thesocial images too, is you\u2019ve got this thing, there\u2019s ways you can distribute your content in a wayout to the different platforms.But I go Google too. Like I image should be, if we land on this should be a part of thisconversation. Mm-hmm. Because then you\u2019re going, okay, ex. I mean, what if you could takeyour blog posts, they get all this traffic and increase it by 10%? That\u2019s a headline. Wow. Or the,the product. So, you know, well, like you talked about e-commerce, um, what if there\u2019s a way togenerate, easily an image that could be feature post featured image post or [00:53:00]something in, in the thing.But it also gets some SEO ranking when they\u2019re going, and I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t do this myself, but,um, I don\u2019t look for images in Google necessarily, but it just compelling to kind explore that. Doyou? Okay. Yeah.Corey Maass: Like we talked about, I think, I think it would be really interesting to know, like, I, Imake the assumption that Google looks at images more than alt tag, title tag.Like, I think we\u2019re to the point. I, I, I.Safe assumption, I don\u2019t know. Um, but I assume that Google can, if they look at a blog post,they look at the image, they read the alag, but then they actually parse the image and say, yes,this is in fact an image of a sunset when we\u2019re talking about places to vacation. I don\u2019t know ifthat\u2019s true. I\u2019d love to find out if that\u2019s [00:54:00] true.But it\u2019s like, so if you have an image that has words on it, I mean, at this point when I open animage with words on it in, you know, Mac preview or Microsoft Paint, the words are editable. Sothe, uh, algorithm for parsing text in an image is so commonplace now that it\u2019s built into the, thefree image editor on, on Mac Os.So I have to assume that it\u2019s that pervasive everywhere. So, Um, you know, so is there a, anSEO benefit to having words in an image that then gets shared? Um mm-hmm. Or no?Cory Miller: Well, I mean, I would go, if you\u2019re gonna post an image, you know, your tourism,your e-commerce shop, you\u2019re, why not? You\u2019ve already got the images there.Yeah. Um, you should be doing some image sto. I mean, that\u2019s just easy, you know, a little bitmore effort and you\u2019re able to, [00:55:00] I don\u2019t know, cast a net water, but I go, if you\u2019re gonnapost, uh, I don\u2019t know, air compressors in somebody\u2019s trying to find, you know, whatever thereason they might be looking for that.But you post a picture of the image compressor, that\u2019s one thing. But I\u2019ve seen more images toocome up where it\u2019s like, put a little bit of text on there or it branded, you know, or I don\u2019t know. Ilike that mindset of going, how do we help them get a little bit more. Um, reach from somethingthey\u2019re probably already doing.\nCorey Maass: Um, right. I googled how to do image seo and one of the results that came up,so the first sponsored post, uh, is the, the image next to it is dude on laptop. The, the imageadds nothing to the headline, how to optimize images for websites. And [00:56:00] there\u2019s apicture of a dude with a, with a laptop, no value, no context, like if that image came outtacontext, there\u2019s nothing there.Scroll down, um, to another one. 10 steps to optimize images for seo, and next to it is a cardthat has. People, you know, a little graphic of people. Awesome. But it\u2019s in, in text, even thoughthe image is this big in text that almost fills the card. It has the same headline, 10 steps tooptimize images for seo.And there\u2019s a little logo of the website that it\u2019s on, and if I click on it and it gets bigger, there\u2019s thesubtitle that\u2019s like, you know, who\u2019s who. It\u2019s by when it was posted. Um, you know, and it\u2019s likeright there. That\u2019s the image that we\u2019re talking, we\u2019re talking about generating, but somebodyhad to go in and create that card.Well, so I figure if, if, if the, if the third result for searching for Google for [00:57:00] Image SEOis an article about optimizing images for seo, and they include an image that has words on it.You know, and, and like, I mean, we we\u2019re talking about Google, you know, the, the automation,the bots, the algorithms, the, you know, the ai, whatever. But I mean, the obvious benefit is ofjust human stuff is obvious. Like putting something on Twitter, an image that has words ratherthan an image of just a dude on a laptop.Yeah. Obvi, you know, obvious value, but, well, but we do, I thought about Pinterest.Cory Miller: Mm-hmm. Yep. Oh yeah. It\u2019s, I forget about it all the time, but I mean, there\u2019s somany that go, like, it\u2019s a pin and you\u2019re looking for stuff and mm-hmm. You know, taking, it\u2019s away to get a tra traffic back to your post about it.Well put enough detail that entices them to come over. Yep. Um, okay. I wanna get back to[00:58:00] this. Okay. I\u2019m, I\u2019m doing a post and, and may, maybe there\u2019s others, but I think aboutjust. I spent my career with the organic SEO content, um, and I get somebody to the site, andthat\u2019s the first part of the big, the whole process, just getting someone to the site.Um, it talked about like popups help you, you know, do that. Mm-hmm. There\u2019s inbound content,like now that we have patterns within Gutenberg, code editor, block editor, like insertingsomething called a action within that. Um, my traditional has been get \u2019em on the site and givethem some offer that fills irresistible discount, ebook, lead magnet, you know, opt into thenewsletter thing.Corey Maass: Yep.[00:59:00]And I\u2019m, and I, what I\u2019m thinking is, Sim similar to our previous conversations. You know, it\u2019sgonna take a handful of conversations to continue to unearth all of these possibilities, right?This list, which already is 10 points long, is gonna be a lot longer. And so I want someconfirmation, like there\u2019s, there\u2019s an, to me, there\u2019s an obvious benefit of like what I justdescribed.I\u2019m seeing a card, a text on it that somebody had to generate. Do we, can we confirm that youraverage team of one a person who\u2019s blogging, um, recipe, ooh, recipe cards, um, do they.[01:00:00] More of these images generated and or are they already trying to generate theseimages? Are they, you know, is, is the average, um, person, you know, a team of one or two,um, who\u2019s got a, a YouTube vlog or a recipe blog or whatever.Are they posting their article with the recipe? And then what are the next steps they take? Like,that\u2019s the broad question. Do they then go generate images to then put on socials and how dothey schedule, you know, all that stuff? What are the images that they actually care about? Um,to me the, the gut assumption is there are enough people doing something as a next step.And so I\u2019m inclined to. Um, again, get to a point where I\u2019ve essentially solved a problem forgenerating something. And to me, I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I have no problem solving this for me [01:01:00] andyou to start with. Mm-hmm. Um, where I\u2019m generating my images from my music blog, I\u2019mgenerating a couple of basic templates for Instagram, whatever, me as a musician to promote.Um, again, I\u2019m looking at my clients like, what do they need? So a basic Twitter image with aheadline that has a logo on it. Um, and then for you, the post status, um, banners make, how dowe make them all look the same? So again, a logo and, you know, if, if these are all, um, I thinkwhat we looked at, right? Were profiles of people.So it\u2019s upload a picture of the person, post status logo on the left, maybe their name and, um,you know, and, and something from the, you know, and, and then. And then it\u2019s, it\u2019s, to me, it\u2019s,\nit\u2019s up to, again, we\u2019re looking for feedback and or you doing some interviews to find out like,yes, everybody, everybody wants Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, [01:02:00] LinkedIn, like theobvious socials.Um, or yes, people desperately wish that there were slides. Like, I love your interest in slides,but you\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve ever heard of that says that. Um, which doesn\u2019t dismiss it. It justmeans like, that\u2019s not the circle I\u2019m in, right? So, um, yeah, that\u2019s, to me, that\u2019s not something wewant to generate first, but go find me 10 people that are gonna find that interesting.Or if I get you to a point where you can sit down and generate pro templates yourself, you\u2019ll belike, cool, let me go build a slide one, because that\u2019s what I want. And then, and then cuz it\u2019s likeonce, it\u2019s kind of like Canva, like, you know, that they have somebody on staff whose job it is tojust crank out templates mm-hmm.To solve all these little problems. Oh, whoops. We don\u2019t have one for podcasts. Great. 3000 by\n\nGo, go generate that. Oh, there you go. Podcast. Um, yeah. Add that to your list. Um, orwe don\u2019t, you know, [01:03:00] people are posting record their, their new album on, onBandcamp. What, how do you know an image generator for Bandcamp that I\u2019m talking aboutback to Canva?It\u2019s like they, because they\u2019re going, they\u2019re going inch deep, mile wide, you know. Yeah. Sothey, they want one of everything, but there\u2019s, you know, and for them, there\u2019s s e o value, like,you know, there\u2019s a landing page for every single template they have. Because that wayanybody who\u2019s googling for anything, you know, album cover template, they\u2019re, they\u2019re hoping topop up.Mm-hmm. We\u2019ll get there once we have the delivery system for templates, essentially. Um, andI\u2019m not saying we necessarily want to, like, we don\u2019t wanna start there, like let\u2019s find some clearanswers of, of what templates to build first, what, what problems to solve first.Cory Miller: I, I\u2019m still, uh, still so compelled by the slide content and I put in the crazy ideascolumn Here is, uh, LinkedIn [01:04:00] slide content.So the AJ told me about, find this link for you. Um, this service, it\u2019s like a LinkedIn. You\u2019ve seenthis on Instagram too. Um, I\u2019ll find it. It\u2019s a LinkedIn image carousel creator. You put your tweet inand it\u2019ll give you the, the slide content. Oh, Uhhuh. You know, when I tested that on LinkedInseveral years ago, my slide content got way more views than anything else I was doing.And, uh, so I think even like for LinkedIn, um, you think about it, it\u2019s like busy professionals usedto a common language of slides. Yep. Uh, and then being able to quickly get the informationwithout having to go through 1500 words. Yep. It\u2019s still compelling to me.Corey Maass: Um, well, and, and a, a neat coincidence, right?I was like everybody else, I\u2019m looking at, um, Twitter threads [01:05:00] about chat g p tprompts. Um, or you know, what, what are 10 neat things that have happened in the 48 hourssince they released ChatGPT four, um, you know, people have generated re had it generate aworking version of pong, uh, in 60 seconds. I\u2019d mean ridiculous things.But one of the things that I saw was that I, that I was like, oh, this is actually relevant to theworld. Um, other than recreating pong, um, Is somebody dumped in an article and said, make,make 10 slides. And it did. And I, yeah, they\u2019re not styled or anything, but it\u2019s just, here are thebullet points that you\u2019d wanna put on each.So it\u2019s like, uh, you know, have this talk to AI that then gen, you know, write a blog post, click abutton, chat, g p t or some other AI generates the slide content. We generate the slide images.Yeah. Yeah. Holy crap.Cory Miller: Yeah. On that [01:06:00] link too for you.Corey Maass: Um, okay, so we\u2019re over an hour. Where do we go? What\u2019s next? How do westart?What do you wanna do? What are you gonna do today? Um, what do you want me to do? Whoare we gonna talk to? How are we gonna get clients? I think,Cory Miller: I think, um, one area to explore is, um, talking to content journey. Seeing the outputof what they\u2019re doing, asking about the problems and challenges they have in that process fortheir clients.Um, I just forgot, I think there\u2019s an opportunity here to potentially innovate in this of here\u2019s howthis is going, here\u2019s how people do, what is the way to help you stand out? Hmm. So thestandout, and that\u2019s why I say innovate, not just helping cure the workflow issue, but I think[01:07:00] one thing I wanna really explore this time is can we innovate with something?\n\nThat\u2019s where I think the slide content, you know, whether it\u2019s a valid thing or not, is in that realmof they\u2019re doing something. What\u2019s way, one way that could help that content stand out evenmore. It, it includes social images, it includes STO image, SEO and stuff like that. Um, I waslike, Lindsay has a mental health treatment center client.And, and that\u2019s probably one of their best case studies because they took a, aside from, youknow, rarely getting any content to, uh, tenant, I mean considerable. And it drove a lot ofbusiness for \u2019em. And, uh, you think about it, like I, I, I remember talking to him cuz I did someconsulting with them, with the client and they\u2019re trying to find images.That\u2019s another issue we\u2019ve talked about, but it\u2019s out, that\u2019s out there. It\u2019s for somebody else\u2019ssaw potentially. But you go, if they\u2019re doing the image, what\u2019s something that could help thatstand out? And it\u2019s maybe a pull quote. [01:08:00] Mm-hmm. You know, from it or something likethat. That\u2019s where I want to dig in is, um, I\u2019ll talk to Emily over there.Um, And, uh, ask some of that. They\u2019ve got another service called my marketing assistant too.And I\u2019ll ask, what are some of the anonymized, um, client requests they get? Yeah, sure. Theydo have a podcaster in their beta program. Um, prolific podcaster who uses a lot of thedistributed media. Um, like I think he probably uses his website as the base, but, um, a lot of therequests he\u2019s getting is, you know, create the thumbnails for those things that they do, use thosetools that we talked about.But, uh, I think one thing that might give us an edge on this is just like creating a new standardwhere everybody\u2019s going like, whoa, whoa, how\u2019d they do that? I want that too. Like I was tellingyou about the Casto little tip box and stuff. [01:09:00] Um, so that\u2019s what I would like to explorein this and then just understand their process a little bit better.And what would be something that doesn\u2019t take a lot of time. But then enhances uh, the contentand makes it stand out a little bit more. And I mean, it could be that whole call to action thing,you know? Um, like a, being able to stylize some, you know, for the treatment center it\u2019s call us.Cuz if they call, if someone calls the treatment center, they can really help them and understandwhat the right fit is and all that kinda stuff.So their call to action is, you know, I think it still is the case, but if they get a phone call, that\u2019sgreat. That\u2019s where they want to be. And then that turns over their sales operation. I\u2019m trying tothink of another client. Um, there\u2019s a lot of b2b, so, um, B2B there too. That seems like[01:10:00] another area where maybe big companies have innovated with the B2B space.Let me put that in here cause I don\u2019t want to drop this. Like, I have a friend that has amanufacturing company. He does the air condit, the cooling compressor stuff. He remanufacturethem. And, uh, I mean, there\u2019s a space with people with money, um, and it\u2019s business money.They go, oh, if it helps increase whatever their KPI is.I mean, that\u2019s, that\u2019s pretty big.Corey Maass: Yeah. And I\u2019ve got, I was just pinging, um, people within my client teams of like,okay, who generates social media content so that I can line up an interview, talk to them about,okay, what\u2019s your process? Um, and I, and what\u2019s kind of neat is, is again, I\u2019ve got. It\u2019stechnically the same, same [01:11:00] client, but I\u2019ve got two websites, two teams that approachthings very differently.One is, um, a lot more tech savvy and a lot more, um, trendy or, or, you know, they are active onTikTok. We are advertising on TikTok, stuff like that. And the other one is, is a fairly traditionalnews content magazine. Um, and, uh, with, and the, and the team is a lot less technical and we,and we don\u2019t need to be nearly as cutting edge or edge or trendy.Um, and so I\u2019m, I\u2019ve kind of got a young hip social media marketer wizard, and then I\u2019ve also gotpeople that are like, I write the article and then I go put it on Twitter. Um, and, and so I can kindof see how, how two of these very different approaches go about solving more or less the sameproblem. Yeah.Cory Miller: And that featured image summary card type thing I think is still [01:12:00] reallycompelling. I\u2019m gonna highlight that. Where\u2019s that? Yeah, I,Corey Maass: I, that\u2019s a very quick, easy win for anybody, not for us specifically. It\u2019s like makeyour featured image more compelling and, and much more valuable when shared.Cory Miller: And because again, you know, look at outputs for that, you go, well that\u2019s aPinterest thing. I mean, maybe that doesn\u2019t get pinned, but it\u2019s a social card. It could havepossibilities for the Pinterest stuff. It\u2019s a visual thing that en might entice someone to go, oh,that\u2019s interesting. Um, and that stuff like to just do that pull image from post add overlay of.\nThere you go. Print, you know, I mean, as simple as that with the brand logo. Yep. Dacon orsomething like that. Yep,Corey Maass: yep. [01:13:00] Okay. Yeah. And there\u2019s, and there\u2019s, yeah, and there\u2019s, there\u2019s acouple of plugins out there that do something that touch on that. Um, and I\u2019ve, I messed aroundwith one, not the other of the two that I know of, but they, they were, at least at the time, were,were limited to generating, um, an open graph image.I was like, generate image, paste it into Slack, you see the image. And I, and I was like, great,but I, where do I write? Click Save as so that I can go post it to Twitter. Mm-hmm. It\u2019s like, oh,you know, it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s just in, it\u2019s in your media library. It\u2019s like, okay, well, And thenalso what about all these other solutions or other scenarios?Um, for me, I was just originally thinking the big socials, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,Instagram. The big difference being 16, nine or square. But now we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s like,yeah, either easy ways to generate multiple variations and [01:14:00] stuff. It\u2019s like this could goa lot, a lot further. Um, so, but it\u2019s, but I definitely, you know, there\u2019s to talk about, you know,people talk about competition.It\u2019s like, oh, the competition is Photoshop, Canva, um, nothing, nothing is always a, acompetitor. Um, you know, but also I, you know, there are other WordPress plugins that dotouch on this, so we\u2019ll have to do a little research there too.Cory Miller: Yeah, like the nothing part is me. Um, I created a blog post and then it\u2019d beprobably nice to have some visual.Icon, thumbnail featured image that, um, highlight some points in there, but, um, okay. That\u2019ll be,mine is exploring that with, uh, I\u2019ll start with Emily cause she\u2019s doing a lot of the team interface,[01:15:00] cl team, client interface stuff. She seemed a pretty good volume of work. I like themarketing angle. How do we, cuz that could go across any of these potential avatars if we\u2019rehelping them do better marketing, um, redistribution, that\u2019s the social images of seo, all that kindof stuff.Corey Maass: Yeah. Um, well, and um, again, I,I wanna say I put my foot down cuz I think that\u2019s a hilarious phrase. In a Mad Men 1960shusband sort of way. I don\u2019t make me put my foot down. Um, but I, I, I want to, I very adamantlywanna draw the line at doing the posting or interacting with the socials. Um, other than like, wecan have a button that says, post this to Twitter and it just links, you know, we\u2019ll throw you overthere kind of thing.Cuz I\u2019ve actually even, I [01:16:00] built a plugin at one point that you could queue up tweets,but it\u2019s like, it worked. But, you know, with all the drama around Twitter, a p i lately, let alone forthe last Yeah. 10 years, like, I don\u2019t want to get into that. But, um, you know, one, one of the, wewere talking about. What are we talking about?We must have been talking about, um, integration points with other tools, um, for Crop Expressanyway, it\u2019s like, so if we generate images and then, and then I, you know, let\u2019s, we can look at,um, auto, you know, if you generate an, an open graph image that Yost automatically picks thatup. Um, so there\u2019s an integration point.Um, I use Buffer to post to mild my socials. Maybe they have an API or an integration point. Soit\u2019s like we can, you know, there\u2019s gonna be a potential for not only generating the images, but atleast getting them to the services that use those images. I don\u2019t wanna become those [01:17:00]services, but you know, there\u2019s, we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve got an opportunity there too.Cory Miller: Yeah. Okay. I put integrations with SEO plugins. Um,That, that questionwhen I talk to Emily, I\u2019ll ask, um, what, what are the common goals that they\u2019re, are they trying topush to a phone number? Are they trying to push to, um, an email list? It\u2019s probably one of thosetwo, I would guess is building the appeal, unless social startCorey Maass: higher up. Do they even, you know, are they thinking that strategically, like, not tosay the agency [01:18:00] isn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t, but as a client, like if a client comes to \u2019em as like,we need images for Twitter, like, because everybody else does or because you under, youknow, they understand.It\u2019s the value in including a phone number.Cory Miller: Now I do know, I do know, um, a lot of the clients they work with, and these are notWordPress or tech people, um, social is hot, you know?\nCorey Maass: Sure. Um, social hot, why, I guess, right? Mm-hmm. Cynically, are they doing itbecause everybody tells them to, you know, are there, are there teenage kids telling them, dad,you\u2019ve gotta get your, um, shoe com, you know, your air compressor company on the tos.And dad goes, okay, son, great, I\u2019ll do that. You know, or, or are they measuring? [01:19:00] Youknow, are they like, what, where does our traffic come from? Oh, we sell most of our aircompressors on Twitter, but not, or probably Facebook, but not on Twitter, and we\u2019ve never.Sold anything off of Insta, you know what I mean?Like, I\u2019m curious if, if, if, how companies are thinking about these, what am I trying to say? Weknow in, especially in the context of this conversation, that there\u2019s a potential to turn these patturn to turn passive images into valuable calls to action. Mm-hmm. To actually generate, youknow, it\u2019s like I post an image, I post, I post something on Twitter.It sucks In the featured image. The featured image is, you know, a pretty sunset. It, it might drawa human\u2019s attention, but that\u2019s very different than again the card. Uh, the [01:20:00] s e o cardthat I saw here, that\u2019s like words that are also drawing me in to like a phone number. So it\u2019s like,wow, I don\u2019t even have to click through.To, uh, to find out a phone number. I\u2019m just dialing eight eighty eight, et cetera. Mm-hmm. So it\u2019slike there\u2019s, I, I\u2019m curious how people are thinking about it, if they\u2019re thinking about it, because ifnot, like there\u2019s great opportunity to ask for us to do education, um mm-hmm. And, or cuz it\u2019slike, we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve talked about, this is the first time you\u2019ve mentioned phone numbers.Um, so it\u2019s like, you know, our, our default is like, oh, this is gonna go on Twitter and it\u2019s gonnalook pretty, it\u2019s gonna be the title of the post. Um, you know, with bullet points. It\u2019s a tldr, but likewhat you just said I think is amazing of like, imagine if for a small business, if it included thephone number, the logo, and the phone number.So it\u2019s like nobody ever, or the address, right? Mm-hmm. So people don\u2019t see it on Facebook orsee it on Twitter and they don\u2019t even have to click through.Cory Miller: [01:21:00] Mm-hmm. Then it\u2019s an ad, right? Like, Retail shop coming up withsomething, they\u2019ve got an event, a coupon or something that could, they\u2019re posting on theirwebsite, so it\u2019s RSVPs and then having a card that they could just easily go export or, you know,save or whatever it is, and then they can go post that.Corey Maass: How is the, we have a, a pie shop in town. How are they generating the imagefor their daily specials? Are they going into Canva every day?Yep. The sandwich shop, the, you know, all the food trucks that are posting their location, andthis is taking it way out of the context of a post.[01:22:00]Which is where something like Canva makes more sense. Like people are doing it, generatingan image unto itself. Right. My friend, um, Mike has the epic food truck that makes unbelievablebrisket and meat filled happiness, um, out of his food truck. Um, so he has to consistently postwhere he\u2019s at, what are today\u2019s specials, and this is, and I\u2019ll post them on the local Facebookgroups and people go running us too.So I\u2019m like, okay, I should ask him how he\u2019s generating and I need to think back. It\u2019s like, is hegenerating images? Is he upload? I kind of feel like he\u2019s uploading the same logo every timeand then writing the content, but, and so is there value in all of the content being on the image?I don\u2019t know. I have to think about that.I\u2019m sure you\u2019d wanna include the words [01:23:00] too, but, right. Yeah. I might have aconversation with him.Cory Miller: Yeah, I think that\u2019d be great. Um, I\u2019ll do one with, uh, Emily, see where that goes.And then I, I just shared the, uh, this whiteboard with you in Slack. Great. I have a friend.Thanks so much. This is, uh, this is good stuff.Okay. So I got my marching orders to talk to Emily about that, see what they\u2019re doing, see ifthere\u2019s ideas to like, drive the conversions that they need for post, explore some of the eBookstoo. I put course up here cause I think that\u2019s another thing. Yep. But, um, yeah, I was thinkingthat too.Corey Maass: Okay. Um, yeah, and I think I\u2019m gonna talk to, I\u2019ve got one or two people to talkto.Um, and I think, I think I will try to, I, well, I, like I said earlier, like I do want to. Make sure thatI\u2019m wrapping up Crop express properly.
