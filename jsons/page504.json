California State University San Bernardino. Transcripts do not include course work completed at other institutions; the transferable units\u00a0only, are reflected on transcripts under \u201ctransfer work\u201d. For students who have both undergraduate and post-baccalaureate course work, please be aware that it is not possible to separate undergraduate course work from the post-baccalaureate course work. Both careers will appear on the transcript, as it is considered one official record.\nPLEASE NOTE: We do not accept requests for\u00a0unofficial transcripts.\u00a0Unofficial transcripts can be obtained over your Student Center page on myCoyote.\nOfficial Transcripts\n\nOrder\u00a0On-line: This service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. (There is an additional $2.35 convenience fee, per transcript, for using the service through Parchment).\u00a0 Please follow the instructions carefully as you enter your information so that we may provide your transcripts without any delays. \u00a0\n\t\n\n\n\nRequest a Transcript Online\nTranscript Fees\n\nThe fee for regular service is $6.00 for the first copy and $3.00 for each additional copy requested and prepared at the same time. The processing time is two to four business days and\u00a0does not include mailing time.\n\nSpecial Instructions\n\nGrades: Grades for the current term will be posted the day after they become available. We will process your request once the grades have been posted for that term. Please be sure to be as specific as possible, as errors will require a new request form and fee.\nDegrees: Degrees earned in a current term will be posted on transcripts after grades become available and all degree requirements have been met. Commencement is the ceremony that occurs and graduation is the physical posting of your degree. The posting of a degree for each individual student takes approximately four weeks from grades posting. We will process your request once the degree has been posted.\n\nHolds\nIf there is a hold on your student records, it must be cleared with the department that placed the hold\u00a0before transcripts can be processed. Holds may be placed on your student records by other departments on campus for various reasons (i.e. books, equipment, documents). Transcript requests that are received by mail, will be returned by mail, if there is a hold on record.\nQuestions\nQuestions should be directed to the Transcript Unit in the Office of the Registrar, UH-171. The direct phone line is 909-537-5268. The email address is\u00a0transxhelp@csusb.edu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight Content\n\n\nRegister to Vote\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistrar, Office of the\n\n\n\nLocation:UH-171\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\n\nMonday - Friday: \n 8:00 am - 5:00 pm\n\n\n\n\nSaturday - Sunday: \n Closed\n\n\n\n\n\nSummer Hours:\nMonday\u00a0 - Thursday\u00a0\n7:00 am\u00a0-\u00a05:30 pm\nClosed Fridays\nExtended Hours --\u00a0First ten days of classes:\nMonday - Thursday\n7:30 am\u00a0- 6:00 pm\u00a0\u00a0\nFridays and days prior to holidays\n7:30 am\u00a0- 5:00 pm\nFor Records:\nPhone: (909) 537-5200, Option 2\nEmail:\u00a0recordsinfo@csusb.edu\nCSUSB Transcripts:\n(909) 537-5268\nEmail:\u00a0transxhelp@csusb.edu\nFor Registration:\nPhone: (909) 537-5200, Option 1\nRegistration Help Desk:\n(909) 537-7671\nEmail\u00a0Registration\nFor Evaluations:\nPhone: (909) 537-5200, Option 4\nEmail Evaluation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media\n\n\n\nOffice of the Registrar Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Region\n\n\n\nCSUSB\n\n\nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino\n5500 University Parkway\nSan Bernardino, CA 92407\n+1 (909) 537-5000\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Social Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso of InterestSubmitting DocumentsRequesting a TranscriptRecords \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1 \n\n\n\n\nLogin\n\n\n\n\nmyCoyote\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\nStudent Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB  \nDrupal Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Interest to...\n\n\n\n\nFuture Students\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Students\n   Interests\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nFull-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nPart-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & Visitors\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nAlumni & Friends\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Partners\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nMilitary/Veterans\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 2 \n\n\n\n\nEmployment\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB \nJob Listings\n - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nFaculty Jobs\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nCareer Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHuman Resources\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Employment\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nContact\n  CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nClery Act\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Safety Reports\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTitle IX Notice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure of Consumer Information\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 3 \n\n\n\n\nCampus Services\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Advising\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHousing & Residential Life\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nOmbuds Services\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nParking\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPolice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPsychological Counseling\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nServices to Students with Disabilities\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Health Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Support\n\n\n\n\nTranscripts\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\n\n\n\nNon-Discrimination Notice\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Copyright/DMCA Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
