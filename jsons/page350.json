The intent is to allow testing an SQLite integration with WordPress and gather feedback, with the goal of eventually landing it in WordPress core.\nThis project is based on the original work of Kojima Toshiyasu and his SQLite Integration plugin, and the work of Evan Mattson and his WP SQLite DB plugin \u2013 See https://github.com/aaemnnosttv/wp-sqlite-db.\nIt also includes code from the PHPMyAdmin project (specifically parts of the PHPMyAdmin/sql-parser library), licensed under the GPL v2 or later. More info on the PHPMyAdmin/sql-parser library can be found on GitHub.\n\nFAQ\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of this plugin?\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the SQLite plugin is to allow testing the use of an SQLite database, with the goal to eventually land in WordPress core.\nYou can read the original proposal on the Make blog, as well as the call for testing for more context and useful information.\n\n\nCan I use this plugin on my production site?\n\n\nPer the primary purpose of the plugin (see above), it can mostly be considered a beta testing plugin. To a degree, it should be okay to use it in production. However, as with every plugin, you are doing so at your own risk.\n\n\nWhere can I submit my plugin feedback?\n\n\nFeedback is encouraged and much appreciated, especially since this plugin is a future WordPress core feature. If you need help with troubleshooting or have a question, suggestions, or requests, you can submit them as an issue in the SQLite GitHub repository.\n\n\nHow can I contribute to the plugin?\n\n\nContributions are always welcome! Learn more about how to get involved in the Core Performance Team Handbook.\n\n\n\nReviews\n\n\n\n \n\n\n Possibly worst UX trap I have ever seen\n\n\nKnut Sparhell\nApril 22, 2023\n1 reply\n\n\nInstalled version 2.0\n\n\n\nActivated\n\n\n\nMessage: \"All checks completed successfully, your site can use an SQLite database. You can proceed with the installation.\"\n\n\n\nScreen with text and button. Ok, I can go back by just deactivating this plugin! Great!\n\n\n\nClicked button \"Install SQLite database\"\n\n\n\n\"PDO Driver for SQLite is missing\" alone on an blank page, wheverer I go\n\n\n\nStuck. My somewhat \"well crafted\" and sophisticated testing site gone away, it seemed. \n\n\n\n\nWhy could this plugin not check the availability of this driver before presenting a clickable button, or even proceeding?\n\n\n\nSince I'm knowledgable enough to delete the \u00b4wp-content/db.php\u00b4 file I was soon back to start, so I don't need help.\n\n\n\nOthers, if less knowledable in WP, should be warned and stay away until proper tests can be made before proceeding. On screen instructions on how to manually disable it in an emergency should also be given.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tRead all 0 reviews\t\t\n\nContributors & Developers\n\u201cSQLite Database Integration\u201d is open source software.
