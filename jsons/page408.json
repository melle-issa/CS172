Here\u2019s why some teachers aren\u2019t panickingJill TuckerApril 23, 2023\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAisling Prange, head of Academic Honesty at Roosevelt Middle School in San Francisco, teaches her seventh-grade English class.Lea Suzuki/The Chronicle\n\nWhen\u00a0ChatGPT launched for free five months ago, the primary response among educators\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 including in the Bay Area\u00a0\u2014 was panic.\u00a0\nThe online program can write long-form essays in a matter of seconds or solve algebraic equations step-by-step and create outlines, among other capabilities that led to instant anxiety among educators across the country when the free chatbot launched publicly in November.\n \nAs predicted, examples of cheating using ChatGPT popped up almost immediately in the Bay Area and elsewhere. At San Francisco\u2019s academically competitive Lowell High School, an informal poll by the student newspaper found that 19% of students included in the survey appeared to be using the program to cut corners, saying they used \u201cAI-powered writing software to complete classwork, essays, or tests.\u201d\nBut in a relatively short period of time the panic started to ebb as teachers acknowledged that cheating is not new. Students have long conned their way to good grades\u00a0\u2014 from crib notes scribbled on an arm to copying from the encyclopedia to texting test questions to friends and plagiarizing from the\u00a0internet.\nAnd so now there\u2019s a new way to cheat.\nBut with five months of exposure to the new technology, educators say ChatGPT and similar technologies have the potential to enrich and enliven teaching and learning rather than gut them. While educators remain on the lookout for ChatGPT cheaters, the opportunities in this technology are thrilling, they said.\n\u201cThis is a moment that\u2019s going to go down in history,\u201d said Old Dominion University educational technology Professor Helen Crompton, an expert in the field for more than 25 years. \u201cThis is a fantastic educational opportunity. We need to grab hold of it and be excited.\u201d\n\nCrompton argues that not only does AI and ChatGPT offer opportunities to make teaching and learning more interesting and interactive, but it can also expose deficiencies in outdated forms of education. For example, some teachers overrely on essays about the same topics year after year, like the five-paragraph argumentative essay.\u00a0\u00a0\nInstead of having students write that stereotypical essay, which ChatGPT could do in seconds about virtually any subject, the student could prompt the program to debate the topic, turning in the back-and-forth result to their teacher, demonstrating knowledge of the subject and the ability to present an argument.\nOr the teacher could prompt ChatGPT to write the argumentative essay and then have students critique it, improving on the technology\u2019s version, which incorporates a massive amount of information and spits out a stereotypical and mediocre response that lacks voice, creativity and other aspects of individualistic thinking.\n\n\nEnglish teacher\u00a0Aisling Prange, head of Academic Honesty at Roosevelt Middle School, \u00a0is fired up about the possibilities ChatGPT brings to her classroom.Lea Suzuki/The Chronicle\n\n\u201cStudents get burned out and tired of doing the same old stuff,\u201d Crompton said. \u201cThey want to do something exciting.\u201d\nAisling Prange, the English department head at Roosevelt Middle School in San Francisco, is fired up about the possibilities ChatGPT brings to her classroom.\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible technology so how can we use it?\u201d Prange asked.\u00a0\nIt seems there\u2019s a place for it in project-based learning, she added, with students using the chatbots to come up with ideas or help write outlines or offer summaries of research.\u00a0\nThat means, however, that class assignments need to incorporate what a chatbot can do, but also require using the human brain\u2019s ability to reason and critique, something a machine can\u2019t do.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a big shift for educators who are more traditional,\u201d she said, referring to the \u201cread the book, write the essay\u201d approach.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about learning the formulas anymore and applying them to the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI want students to feel proud of their own ideas and the way they\u2019re expressing themselves.\u201d\nWhile she hopes to incorporate ChatGPT into assignments in the future, Prange continues to worry about cheating using AI products or other methods. Noticing a rise in cheating this year, she and her school\u2019s administrators sent a letter home advising parents and guardians that they were seeing plagiarism as well as use of ChatGPT, QuillBot, and other online AI programs in language arts classrooms.\nShe hopes parents will talk to their kids about the cons of cheating, something reinforced in her classes and schoolwide.\nRoosevelt\u2019s principal, Emily Leicham, agreed, saying that while the way to cheat has changed, the need to educate students on why it\u2019s a bad idea is a constant.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re an educator you see all the tricks,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing honest, that\u2019s something we really really push with our kids now.\u201d\nWhile Leichem and her staff are focused on teaching academic honesty to mitigate the possibility of cheating with ChatGPT, two big school districts \u2014 in Los Angeles and New York City \u2014 were among those that blocked access to the AI technology in an attempt to prevent it. Some colleges, where educators were equally concerned, tried the same approach.\n\nBut some experts think trying to make it go away won\u2019t work. Furman University philosophy professor Darren Hudson Hick, one of the first in the country to catch a ChatGPT cheat, equated that tactic with the futile effort to ban the internet from classrooms 30 years ago, for fear students would plagiarize information or access inappropriate material.\n\u201cThis is 1993 all over again,\u201d he said, referring to the fear around new technology. \u201cWhat does AI mean for education a year from now, five years from now? Who knows.\u201d\nHick was among the first educators in the country to catch a ChatGPT cheat in mid-December, about three weeks after the technology hit the internet. The South Carolina professor, like all K-12 and college educators across the country, didn\u2019t have technology to combat the problem yet, just years of experience.\nOne student turned in her essay on philosopher David Hume and the paradox of horror, which was well written, he said, but made little sense. When he confronted her, the student subsequently admitted to using ChatGPT. Since then, Hick keeps an eye out for AI in student work. He warns his students about his policy on it, which helps deter cheating.\n\u201cIf I have a whiff of artificial intelligence on anything turned in, I have the option of tossing it out and on the spot giving an oral exam,\u201d he said.\nIn recent months, educators have turned to technology to help identify AI-written work, using a variety of programs like TurnItIn or other screening tools to look for the footprint of artificial intelligence, including tone, word usage and other aspects to determine whether it is likely AI generated or not.\n \nBut those tools aren\u2019t always accurate, and students are already finding ways to beat the AI detectors, including misspelling words, inserting typos and rewriting a handful of sentences.\nThe best defense against the technology is perhaps offense, educators say.\nAt Stanford University, Sarah Levine, assistant professor in the Graduate School of Education, said she\u2019s seeing more excitement and optimism from her students, many of whom are K-12 teachers working on an advanced degree.\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing teachers are using it more and are getting excited about it,\u201d she said, citing one teacher who used it to generate five college application essays about the same topic, but with different tone or style, helping students pay more attention to those elements in their writing.\nLevine said her students are finding that AI generated material is \u201cmushy, vanilla or generic.\u201d\nThat said, it has great potential to help students learn in K-12 classrooms, although it\u2019s still a bit unclear how to use it ethically and effectively.\n\u201cI\u2019m really trying to figure it out myself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really pushing all of us to rethink why we teach what we teach.\u201d\nSan Francisco seventh-grader Zoie Hon thinks so too. She remembers when she first heard about the artificial intelligence program ChatGPT, which can generate human-like responses to questions or prompts.\n\u201cI thought it was really cool that robots could behave like humans could,\u201d she said. But what if, she pondered, this was the precursor to AI taking over the world, a la the Terminator, even though ChatGPT denies such an apocalyptic scenario, writing in a response to the idea that AI \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the capacity to take over the world on its own.\u201d\u00a0\nIt can also help students cheat, the Roosevelt Middle School student acknowledged, but besides that and the possibility of machine-based world domination, she thinks ChatGPT is \u201cpretty cool,\u201d given that it was able to write a funny limerick summing up her conversation with it as part of a class writing assignment on the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.\nHer teachers were impressed with her research, as well as the machine-generated poem that summed up Zoie\u2019s conversation with the program.\u00a0\nBut the seventh-grader acknowledged she\u2019s still wary of AI.\n\u201cI think it probably excites me more than it scares me,\u201d she said, but \u201cI think it really depends on who\u2019s using it and for what purpose.\u201d\nReach Jill Tucker: jtucker@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @jilltucker\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFifth & Mission\n\n\n\n\nThe Chronicle\u2019s flagship news podcast.
