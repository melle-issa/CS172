The CSU Chancellor's Office is diligently working with the California Student Aid Commission to resolve the matter. We will\u00a0add the MCS\u00a0awards as soon and possible and\u00a0will provide an updates as we receive them. Thank you for your patience.\nWelcome and Thank You for Visiting Our Website\nThe Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships at CSUSB provides students and their families with information about financial aid resources and facilitates funding in an accurate and timely manner to assist students in pursuing their educational goals.\nWhether receiving our services and support via telephone or in-person, our mission is to ensure your financial aid experience supports\u00a0you in completing your\u00a0college\u00a0degree or teacher certification within\u00a0a reasonable time frame and with minimal loan indebtedness.\u00a0 While federal regulations do require that you and (if dependent)\u00a0your parents contribute towards your college expenses, as professionals, we focus on your financial needs not covered by your expected family contribution(s) and also based on your meeting aid program eligibility requirements.\u00a0 We strive to maximize your financial aid awards with grants, scholarships, low-interest student loans with\u00a0easy repayment terms, and other types of resources.\u00a0\nBy working together and supporting the quality education you receive at CSUSB,\u00a0you can stay on track towards completing your undergraduate degree within four years.\u00a0 Please take the time to review our website information designed to\u00a0ease your transition into college.\u00a0 Feel free to seek our help if you have financial aid questions.\u00a0 We are here for you throughout the year!\nCSUSB Financial Aid Brochure Information\nHave questions about your financial aid?

Funding for such programs is provided by the federal and state governments, the individual colleges and universities, and a variety of other public and private sources.\n\n\n\n\nPREPARE\nFamiliarize yourself with the types of aid available, how much aid you'll need, and whether you're eligible.\nAPPLY\nWith the exception of some scholarships, everyone must use the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA\u00ae) to apply for aid. When you're ready to apply, fill out the online\u00a0FAFSA\u00ae.\n\n\n\n\nRECEIVE\nThe Department of Education will inform you and CSUSB about your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). Then, CSUSB will tell you how much and what types of aid you qualify for. Check your CSUSB email often - this is the mode by which we communicate with you.\nREPAY\nIf your aid is in the form of loans, become familiar with the repayment process. Loans are legal obligations, so before you take out a student loan, think about the amount you'll have to repay over the years.\n\n\n\n\nFinancial aid is split up into two categories based on the reason the money is awarded:\n\nAchievement-based aid\u00a0is awarded to students who have a special characteristic, skill, talent, or ability. Typically achievement-based aid is in the form of scholarships.\nNeed-based aid\u00a0is provided to students who demonstrate financial need. Most financial aid, particularly public-funded aid, is awarded on the basis of financial need determined through the application process and in accordance with a prescribed federal formula.\n\n4 Basic Types of Financial Aid Programs Available\n\nGRANTS:\u00a0Federal or state gift assistance with no obligation for work or repayment\nLOANS:\u00a0Providing funds now, but with a future repayment obligation\nSCHOLARSHIPS: Gift assistance with no obligation for work or repayment\nWORK-STUDY: Part-time work while attending the institution\n\nMost often, financial aid will come to you in the form of a package consisting of a combination of the different types of aid available. The combination of aid offered depends on the availability of funds, your eligibility, the timeliness with which the application process is completed, and your year in school.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight Content\n\n\nNEW! - Upload Your Docs\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Aid & Scholarships, Office of\n\n\n\nEmail financialaid@csusb.edu\n\n\n\nPhone Number (909) 537-5227 \n\n\n\nLocation:UH-150\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\n\nMonday - Friday: \n 8:00 am - 5:00 pm\n\n\n\n\nSaturday - Sunday: \n Closed\n\n\n\n\n\nScholarship Line: 909-537-7399\nFAscholarships@csusb.edu\nSummer Hours:\u00a0 Monday \u2013 Thursday, 7:00am \u2013 5:30pm, closed Fridays\n\u00a0\nPDC students can email\u00a0pdcfinancialaid@csusb.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Region\n\n\n\nCSUSB\n\n\nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino\n5500 University Parkway\nSan Bernardino, CA 92407\n+1 (909) 537-5000\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Social Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso of InterestImportant Phone NumbersFinancial Aid & Scholarships, Office ofWithdrawing From Classes \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1 \n\n\n\n\nLogin\n\n\n\n\nmyCoyote\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\nStudent Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB  \nDrupal Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Interest to...\n\n\n\n\nFuture Students\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Students\n   Interests\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nFull-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nPart-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & Visitors\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nAlumni & Friends\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Partners\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nMilitary/Veterans\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 2 \n\n\n\n\nEmployment\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB \nJob Listings\n - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nFaculty Jobs\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nCareer Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHuman Resources\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Employment\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nContact\n  CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nClery Act\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Safety Reports\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTitle IX Notice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure of Consumer Information\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 3 \n\n\n\n\nCampus Services\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Advising\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHousing & Residential Life\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nOmbuds Services\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nParking\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPolice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPsychological Counseling\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nServices to Students with Disabilities\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Health Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Support\n\n\n\n\nTranscripts\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\n\n\n\nNon-Discrimination Notice\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Copyright/DMCA Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
