Moving beyond the prototypical content generators that are cobbled together into a plugin, the tools developers are experimenting with today will provide a more deeply integrated experience that works seamlessly with the block editor as a natural extension of its capabilities.\nLast week Human Made CTO Joe Hoyle published an early preview of generative AI natively integrated into the block editor with a video demonstrating prompts working across various blocks.\n\nI\u2019ve been working on a WordPress Gutenberg-native AI copilot. The results were pretty astounding to me once I got GPT to \u201cspeak Gutenberg\u201d pic.twitter.com/adEfkPRHcb\u2014 Joe Hoyle (@joe_hoyle) April 6, 2023\n\n\u201cTaking a native-first approach to integrating generative AI into WordPress, we\u2019ve been experimenting with approaches to a \u2018WordPress Copilot\u2019 that can \u2018speak\u2019 Gutenberg / block-editor,\u201d Hoyle said.\n\u201cCopy-pasting paragraphs between ChatGPT and WordPress only goes so far, while having the tools directly embedded in the editor for block layout generation, auto-linking, formatting, translation summarization and more open up a world of possibilities and productivity wins for content creators.\u201d\nMunir Kamal, WordPress developer and founder of Gutenberg Hub, has created a native AI writer with a similar UI to the tool Hoyle previewed, as they both were inspired by the Notion app. His preview video demonstrates far more capabilities than the earlier AI content generators for WordPress have implemented.\n\nI've been working on a native AI writer inspired by Notion, designed to seamlessly integrate into #Gutenberg. Unlike clunky admin approached #AI plugins this will be your hidden Ai content assistant. Keep an eye out for it at the @GutenbergHub shop.#WordPress #chatgpt pic.twitter.com/WmCkJCpF0l\u2014 Munir Kamal (@m_munirkamal) April 7, 2023\n\nKamal has tapped into the GPT API to add more options to the AI writer, including the ability to rewrite, improve the generated text, fix grammar, simplify language, make it shorter, make it longer, and translate. He plans to release it as a commercial plugin in his Gutenberg Hub shop when it\u2019s ready.\n\n\u201cWith the increasing advancements in AI technology, thanks to OpenAI for taking the leap, I believe it will become an even more integral part of blogging,\u201d Kamal said when asked about AI and the future of blogging. \u201cIt can assist in generating ideas, improving grammar and structure, and even help with SEO optimization.\nHoyle is equally optimistic on the future of AI integrated into WordPress tools. It will be exciting to see if his Gutenberg-native AI copilot can be extended to blocks inside the Site Editor, to offer a text prompt-guided design experience without having to click through the tools.\n\u201cGoing through this project has convinced me that LLMs [Large Language Model] have much more potential than I was giving them credit for,\u201d Hoyle said. \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s still a lot to discover what the models are capable of.\n\u201cAs the availability to GPT-4 (and with it larger token limits) increases, we see a clear path of improvement to what we\u2019ve shown today. The data and information that is stored and available to the Content Management System is ideal for model-training and building a corpus of data specific to the user. Generating, improving and suggesting content of all types that is specific to the data set will be another lead forward in the utility of these tools. We see a future where AI will support and enhance the work we all do, and see the necessity to integrate the technology deeply into the tools and solutions we create.\u201d\nCategory: NewsTags: ChatGPTShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Like thisLike Loading\u2026\n\n3\n\n\n\n\t\t3 responses to \u201cWordPress Developers Are Experimenting With Gutenberg-Native AI Block and Content Assistants\u201d\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Munir Kamal says: \n\nApril 11, 2023 at 2:00 PM \n\n\nThank you so much for including my Ai Writer plugin in the article.
