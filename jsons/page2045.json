If possible, include an anonymized method of contact, as we often need more information about what happened or who was involved.\u00a0It may be difficult to move forward with an inquiry or investigation if we do not have sufficient information or a way to follow-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost the Ethics and Compliance Helpline Poster in your office!\nHelpline Poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain content start\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthics and Compliance Helpline\n\"A situation in the office makes me uneasy.\"\n\"This appears to violate policy or the law.\"\n\"I don't know who to ask!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \nEthics and Compliance HelplineHelpline ProcessHelpline FAQ\u00a0Other Helpline Resources\nExamples of the types of issues you can raise through the Helpline include:\nConflicts of interest,\nWorkplace misconduct,\nEnvironmental health and safety concerns,\nSexual harassment,\nTheft or fraud,\nAccounting irregularities,\nAthletics compliance,\nViolations of law, contract, or University policy\nViolations of the\u00a0University Code of Conduct\u00a0should be reported to the Helpline, including retaliation.\nSample Concerns\nMisuse of University Resources/Fraud Financial Misconduct -\u00a0\"One of my co-workers improperly used\u00a0University funds for personal use.\"\nDiscrimination or Harassment -\u00a0\"I feel threatened by the actions of an individual in the workplace.\"\u00a0\nCompliance with Laws, Policies, and Procedures -\u00a0\"This transaction violates\u00a0University policy and/or federal regulations.\"\nConflict of Interest -\u00a0\"My faculty member\u00a0may have a conflict of interest.\"\nResearch Misconduct -\u00a0\"One of my colleagues may have\u00a0falsified research results.\"\nPlease note: The Ethics and Compliance Helpline is not a 24-hour service\nTo report criminal concerns (non-emergencies), please call the Department of Public Safety (DPS) 24/7 dispatch at (650) 329-2413.\nTo report emergencies, please call 911 or 9-911 on campus.\nTo report questions or concerns related to Stanford Health Care and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, please click\u00a0here.\u00a0\nIf you have a question or concern,\u00a0contact the Ethics and\u00a0Compliance\u00a0Helpline\nWeb Submission (can be made anonymously) - click the next red button\u00a0below\nEthics and Compliance Helpline\nEmail:\u00a0integrity@stanford.edu\nPhone: 650-721-2667\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford\n\n \nThe Office of \nEthics and Compliance\nOffice of the Chief Risk Officer\n\n\n\nWeb Login\n\n\n\nAddress\n\nOffice of the Chief Risk Officer\n505 Broadway\nCardinal Hall, 6th Floor\nRedwood City, CA 94063\nUnited States\n\n\n\nVisit\n\n\nCampus Map\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks to\n\n\nOCRO Staff\n\n\nInternal Audit\n\n\nEnterprise Risk Management\n\n\nRisk Management\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\nInformation Security\n\n\n\n\nResources for\n\n\nDigital Accessibility\n\n\nDiversity and Access\n\n\nPublic Safety\n\n\nUniversity Ombuds\n\n\nStanford's Vision\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanfordUniversity\n\n\n\n\nStanford Home(link is external)\n\nMaps & Directions(link is external)\n\nSearch Stanford(link is external)\n\nEmergency Info(link is external)\n\n\n\nTerms of Use(link is external)\n\nPrivacy(link is external)\n\nCopyright(link is external)\n\nTrademarks(link is external)\n\nNon-Discrimination(link is external)\n\nAccessibility(link is external)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University.\n\u00a0 Stanford, California 94305.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Back to Top\n\n\n\n\n",
