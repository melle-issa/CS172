For these families\u2014and more than 177,000 alumni\u2014Chico State is not just a university or campus. It is the branches of the family tree. This is\u00a0one of six profiles\u00a0of families who are rooted in their Wildcat connection.\nLiving in Laos in 1983, Xue Yang and his wife, Ong, had their first child, a son, Kong. The following year, the family fled for Thailand to escape the Pathet Lao Communists. Along the way, the family added two more sons to their brood\u2014Sue and Ze.\nIn spring 1987, sponsored by a great aunt who lived in Seattle, the family of five emigrated to the Northwest\u2014welcoming another son, Dao, to the family there. In summer 1988, they settled down in Oroville, reuniting with relatives and ending their four-year trek to a new life. Xue and Ong eventually had 10 children (seven boys and three girls) and it was Xue\u2019s dream that every one of his children earn college degrees\u2014he saw all but one of his children graduate before he passed away in December 2019.\nOver the course of 16 years, each of the 10 siblings graduated from Chico State, spanning nine different majors and four colleges, not to mention two teaching credentials and a pair of graduate degrees\u2014the last of which will be conferred this year, when the youngest Yang, Pa, will earn her master\u2019s in psychology.\nTeng, the fifth child and first born in Oroville, said his father\u2019s encouragement to pursue education took root early in the children\u2019s lives.\n\u201cMy dad instilled in us that education is everything, our future, and an opportunity,\u201d said Teng. \u201cHe began preparing us foundationally for education when we were in grade school.\u201d\nIf not for the support of Ong, however, this foundation likely would have crumbled. As the Yang family matriarch, the siblings said she was instrumental in ensuring the house ran smoothly while the kids took care of business in their respective classrooms.\n\u201cMom was always the one that always made sure we were fed and physically OK,\u201d said sister Chia. \u201cEven though she wasn\u2019t able to help us seek the academic resources we needed, Mom was always there to pray over us and to make sure our physical needs were met.\u201d\nXue practiced what he preached, earning an associate\u2019s degree from Butte Community College in business management in spring 1995. Overcoming a language barrier, he attended classes and studied before working evenings. Though the road to graduation was never without its bumps, the Yang siblings say they know their father\u2019s persistence to pursue higher education came from a loving place.\n\u201cGrowing up, you feel like the pressure may have been too much, but as you get older, you learn to appreciate it,\u201d said brother Ze. \u201cIt\u2019s all about love and wanting the best for us.\u201d\n\n\nShare this Article\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tSean Murphy\t\t\n\n\n\t\tSean Murphy (English, \u201997) is the Media Relations Coordinator at Chico State.
