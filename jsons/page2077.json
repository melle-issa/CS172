Photo by Lee Choo.\n\nGlobal accounting and consulting giant EY has donated $850,000 to support accounting students and faculty at California State University, Northridge.\nThe gift was matched with another $150,000 by the CSUN Foundation\u2019s Matador Match Challenge, bringing a total amount of $1 million to support the EY Fund for Excellence in Accounting Education in CSUN\u2019s David Nazarian College of Business and Economics.\n\u201cThe gift from EY, combined with the CSUN Foundation\u2019s match, truly is transformative, for our students and faculty in the Department of Accounting,\u201d said CSUN President Erika D. Beck. \u201cThe firm\u2019s commitment to our students, and the Nazarian College, is inspiring. In addition to providing generous financial support over the years, EY has recruited a significant number of our students. Many of these alumni have risen through the firm\u2019s ranks to serve as partners. EY recognizes the quality of a CSUN education, and we are grateful for their support.\u201d\nJeff Rosen, a partner at EY (formerly known as Ernst & Young), said the firm was proud to continue its support of the Nazarian College and the students in its Department of Accounting.\n\u201cEY has long had a commitment to support the students and accounting department in CSUN\u2019s Nazarian College of Business and Economics, which provides life-changing opportunities for so many students,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cWe understand the value CSUN students bring to the firm as its future employees and the difference CSUN makes to the Southern California community.\u201d\nEY has long supported the Nazarian College and its students. The firm has hired a number of Northridge accounting alumni over the years, and its executives make regular appearances in Department of Accounting classes, offering their insight into the field and support to students.\nIn 2008, it awarded the Nazarian College $500,000 to support the creation of the EY Center for Careers in Accounting, which offers students opportunities to explore what careers are available in accounting and network with accounting firms. It also hosts job postings, career fairs and on-campus interviews, as well as workshops on resume and cover-letter preparation and interviewing. In 2018, the firm made another gift of $375,000 to the college.\nEY\u2019s latest gift will provide continued support for the center, as well as funding for three annual scholarships in the firm\u2019s name to accounting students. The money also includes an annual award to an accounting faculty member to support their research efforts and financial support for a faculty instructor to lead an EY Leadership Seminar each semester.\n\u201cI am so proud of the support we receive from EY,\u201d said Chandra Subramaniam, dean of the Nazarian College. \u201cSince the creation of the EY Center for Careers in Accounting in 2008, EY\u2019s financial support has provided a wide range of career preparation and recruiting services to more than 3,200 Nazarian College accounting students. We deeply appreciate EY\u2019s partnership and support as we educate future accounting professionals.\u201d\nCSUN\u2019s David Nazarian College of Business and Economics is the nineth-largest business college in the country. With nearly 7,000 students, the college is the size of a mid-sized university. Its graduates drive the economy in Southern California and beyond. Its highly regarded accounting program produces more partners and professionals in the top 100 accounting firms in Los Angeles than any other university. Its alumni work at investment banks, private equity firms, and other notable organizations throughout the world, creating economic prosperity and societal well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n accounting, David Nazarian College of Business and Economics, Department of Accounting, EY, EY Fund for Excellence in Accounting Education, Featured, Gift\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n\n\n\nStudying Away \u2013 Get to Know the International and Exchange Student Center\n\n\nNew Tech and a Sense of Community: CSUN\u2019s Assistive Technology Conference Celebrates 38 Years\n\n\nCSUN to host multimedia performance that explores climate change\n\n\n\u2018Ghosts\u2019 Stories: On a Hit TV Show, CSUN Alum Uses His Voice\n\n\nTribal Leader, Philanthropist and Acclaimed Author to Receive Honorary Doctorates from CSUN\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u2190 Triennial Presidential Review by CSU Board of Trustees Underway\nCSUN Distinguished Alumna Judy Baca Honored at White House \u2192\n\n\n\n\n Top Stories\n\n\n\nFeatured Tag\n\n\n\n\n\n \u2018Ghosts\u2019 Stories: On a Hit TV Show, CSUN Alum Uses His Voice\non April 26, 2023in Alumni, Arts and Culture\n\n\n Tribal Leader, Philanthropist and Acclaimed Author to Receive Honorary Doctorates from CSUN\non April 25, 2023in Alumni, Community, CSU News, CSUN Events, Education, Faculty and Staff News, Graduation Ceremony, Honors & Awards, Media Releases, University News\n\n\n CSUN Breaks Ground on Autodesk Technology Engagement Center, a Project with National Impact\non April 24, 2023in Donor Profile, Giving\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCSU Resources CSU Leader\nCSYouCSU News\n\nTopicsArts and Culture\nAthletics\nBusiness\nCommunity\nCSU News\nEducation\nFaculty and Staff News\nHealth and Fitness\nMedia Releases\nPolitics and Society\nScience and Technology\n CSUN in the News\n\nCalifornia State University Northridge President Dr. Erika D.
