Today, the University is being distinguished with an honor that few national colleges and universities can claim.\nChico State has been named a Fulbright HSI Leader in the designation\u2019s inaugural year, and is one of just 35 higher education institutions nationwide to receive the honor. The US Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs is recognizing the noteworthy engagement that select HSIs have achieved with the Fulbright Program, the US government\u2019s flagship international educational exchange program.\nThis Fulbright HSI Leader status has been conferred on this group because each has demonstrated noteworthy engagement with Fulbright exchange participants during the 2019\u20132021 academic years and promoted Fulbright Program opportunities on campus.\n\u201cChico State is among an elite group of Hispanic-Serving Institutions that has created a campus culture which celebrates the mission of Fulbright and international exchanges,\u201d said Jennifer Gruber, Chico State\u2019s interim associate vice president for International Education and Global Engagement. \u201cEven through a pandemic, our campus continues to facilitate meaningful global and cultural learning opportunities through innovative student programs, collaborative online international learning, curriculum development and international exchange.\u201d\nA trio of current Chico State faculty were named as Fulbright scholars for 2021\u201322: Brian Brazel and Jesse Dizard (both from the Department of Anthropology) and Lee Altier (College of Agriculture). Altier, who is currently teaching at Ege University in \u0130zmir, Turkey, said he is firmly committed to the concept of the exchange of ideas\u2014particularly across different cultures.\n\u201cWhen people of diverse backgrounds exchange ideas\u00a0and share their own cultural artifacts, they build bridges and gain an understanding and\u00a0appreciation for each other that promotes compassion and empathy,\u201d he said. \u201cI incorporate this into the content of the courses that I teach, and it was the inspiration for my application to the Fulbright program.\u201d\nAdditionally, the University\u2019s Department of History is hosting a Fulbright Scholar from M\u00e9xico this year, Luz del Rocio Berm\u00fadez. On campus as part of the Fulbright-Garcia Robles program, she is focused on writing a book about the long-lasting history of her hometown, San Crist\u00f3bal de Las Casas, Chiapas. Berm\u00fadez said that one of her early highlights has been the warmth of the Chico State community.\n\u201cThere is a stimulating atmosphere here that creates an intellectual community,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a city that can be enjoyed on foot or by bicycle, and if delight is the fuel of creativity, Chico is the place to be.\u201d\nAs a measure of its commitment to and excellence in providing resources for its Hispanic students, the CSU system represented eight of the 35 schools listed. San Diego State was the lone CSU campus named among Doctoral Institutions, while Masters Institutions included Dominguez Hills, Fullerton, Long Beach, CSUN, San Francisco State, San Jose State and Sonoma State.\nThe Fulbright HSI Leader initiative is part of the US State Department\u2019s longstanding commitment to build diversity and inclusion within the Fulbright Program and within all the Bureau\u2019s international exchange programs. In July, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona released a\u00a0\u201cJoint Statement of Principles in Support of International Education,\u201d which\u00a0outlines\u00a0the many benefits of\u00a0international education and the need for \u201call Americans\u00a0[\u2026] to be equipped with global and cultural competencies.\u201d The Fulbright HSI\u00a0Leaders\u00a0Initiative supports\u00a0the\u00a0goals\u00a0of the Joint Statement, including the\u00a0principle\u00a0that\u00a0US participants in international exchanges should reflect the diversity of the United States.\nThis year marks the 75th anniversary of the Fulbright Program, which was created to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries. The primary source of funding for the Fulbright Program is an annual appropriation made by the US Congress to the US Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.\nFulbright is active in more than 160 countries worldwide and partners with participating governments, host institutions, corporations, and foundations in foreign countries and in the United States.\n\n\nShare this Article\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tSean Murphy\t\t\n\n\n\t\tSean Murphy (English, \u201997) is the Media Relations Coordinator at Chico State.
