In recent years, the museum has worked hard to build a more representative collection by increasing holdings by women and underrepresented artists.\n\n\n\n\nArts & Film \nCelebrating the Museum Without Walls In 2022, Chapman University\u2019s Escalette Permanent Art Collection celebrates \u201c10+2\u201d years as a center of public art for the campus and community.\n Staci DumoskiOctober 3, 20224 min read\n\n\nFor more than a decade, Chapman University\u2019s Phyllis and Ross Escalette Permanent Art Collection\u00a0has served as an important research institute and learning laboratory for students, while curating an ever-growing collection of public art.\u00a0\nSince it was first established in 2010, the \u201cMuseum Without Walls\u201d has grown to include 830 works, including contemporary and modern paintings, prints and sculpture, which are displayed throughout Chapman\u2019s Orange and Rinker campuses, in hallways, study spaces and other public areas where they can be freely viewed.\u00a0\nThis year, the Escalette Collection celebrates its \u201c10+2\u201d anniversary, a somewhat tongue-in-cheek acknowledgement of the fact that official 10-year celebrations were postponed by the pandemic in 2020.\n\u201cAlong with everyone else, our plans for 2020 were upended, but now in 2022 we\u2019re determined to celebrate the generosity of Phyllis and Ross Escalette and their family, as well as every artist whose work is part of the collection,\u201d says Fiona Lindsay Shen, director of the collection.\u00a0\nOver the past five years, the staff has focused on increasing the equity and inclusion of the collection, acquiring nearly 100 artworks by women artists and just over 100 artworks by artists from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen first-hand the positive impact that art can have on a space and the people who work, study, and learn within it,\u201d says Jessica Bocinski, Registrar of the collection. \u201cIn acquiring and displaying artwork by diverse artists, we contribute to the sense of inclusivity on campus in a very tangible way.\u201d\nArt for the Academy \u2013 Curating the Student Experience\u00a0\nHoused nominally in Wilkinson College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences, the collection exists as \u201ca museum without walls,\u201d with artworks exhibited throughout campus. In addition, thanks to the addition of \u201cEMuseum\u201d in 2019, the entire collection can now be viewed online.\u00a0\n\u201cAs an academic collection, we\u2019re committed to sharing research through eMuseum, as well as providing opportunities for students to contribute to a growing body of research,\u201d says Shen, Ph.D. \u201cSo, eMuseum isn\u2019t simply a static catalog of the collection, but a dynamic teaching tool and resource for everybody, whether on campus, or anywhere in the world.\u201d\nIn recent years, students have participated in the curation of campus exhibits with the Escalette Collection. In Shen\u2019s First Year Focus (FFC) class, \u201cExploring the Escalette Collection of Art: An Experiential Journey,\u201d students collaboratively curated an art exhibition related to Wilkinson\u2019s Engaging the World: Environmental Justice initiative and installed it on the first floor of Roosevelt Hall.\u00a0\n\u201cWorking with this exhibit has been something new, but I have learned so much and have enjoyed working hands-on and doing different activities,\u201d says Sarah Sanders \u201825, a graphic design student who participated in the project.\u00a0\n\u201cTo see all of our names on the exhibit plaque was so rewarding,\u201d added Cassandra Chen \u201825, a communications major.\u00a0\nAdditionally, Shen introduced an initiative in her Museum Studies class in 2018, allocating funds to the acquisition of art chosen by students. This annual project promotes students\u2019 ownership of the art in their everyday spaces.\nHelena Walker, a student who participated in the\u00a0 acquisitions project in 2018, appreciates how important it is for students to feel themselves reflected in their environments. \u201cThe feeling of pride I have had walking past Tom Keifer\u2019s \u201cMakeup/No Makeup\u201d is incomparable.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI now feel so empowered in the whole acquisition process,\u201d says Hannah Miller, who participated in the project in 2019. \u201cI know that future students will look forward\u2026 to the possibility of leaving their mark as well.\u201d\u00a0\nNEA Grant Will Fund Electronic Art Installation in Orange\n\u00a0Last year, the Escalette Collection was honored to receive a $35,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. The grant will be used to commission a unique work of interactive public art for Chapman and the Orange community.\u00a0\n\u201cCode becomes Palette\u201d by internationally renowned artist Daniel Canogar will use electronic animations that continuously shift, mutate and ooze bright color to visualize data unearthed by another high-profile Wilkinson College research project \u2013 the Survey of American Fears. Using custom software to run existing and real-time data, the artwork will literally unmask America\u2019s deep-held fears.\nIt will be displayed in the historic Becket Building just a few blocks away from campus and adjacent to the weekly Orange Farmer\u2019s Market, a place where both Chapman and the Orange community can come experience it together.\nThe new artwork will be unveiled by the summer of 2023.
