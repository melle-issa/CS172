We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.Contact UsNeed Help?FacebookFacebookTwitterTwitterInstagramInstagramReport an accessibility issueReport a broken link on this pageTitle IXPrivacy PolicyCalifornia State University, Chico400 West First StreetChico, CA 95929Copyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n",
