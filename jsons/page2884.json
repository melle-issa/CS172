They offer impactful transparency, from discussing the importance of website speed, user experience, and SEO to practicing mindfulness and finding balance. They share insights on optimizing WordPress websites for performance, including hosting, caching, and image optimization tips. They also discuss the role of content in driving traffic and engagement, as well as strategies for leveraging social media to grow an online presence.\nTop Takeaways:\n\nImposter Syndrome. Imposter syndrome is very common among people who work in tech, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge it and understand that it\u2019s okay to feel this way. It\u2019s helpful to talk to others about your feelings and to remind yourself of your accomplishments and skills. It\u2019s important not to compare yourself to others and focus on your progress and growth. Seeking support from a therapist or coach can be very helpful in managing imposter syndrome.\nSlow Hustle. Take a more intentional, thoughtful, and sustainable approach to work and life. Instead of constantly hustling and working long hours, \u201cslow hustle\u201d focuses on balancing work and rest, taking breaks, and being intentional about your work. Finding a pace that works for you helps in avoiding burnout. \u201cSlow hustle\u201d can help you find more fulfillment and purpose in your work and can be beneficial for long-term success.\nPersonal Brand. Building a personal brand can help in various aspects of life. Establish your personal brand by identifying and highlighting your unique skills and strengths, being authentic and consistent, and cultivating relationships. Use social media and online platforms to share your expertise and connect with potential clients or collaborators. Continually invest in your personal and professional development, whether through learning new skills, attending conferences, or seeking mentorship or coaching. Remember the importance of maintaining a positive and professional online presence and reputation, as this can greatly impact your personal brand and career success.\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Mentioned in the show:\n\nCrop.Express\nCrop.Express\nApple\nWordPress\nSquareSpace\nMedium\nSubstack\nGhost\nMatt Mullenweg\u00a0\nChris Coyier\nJeff Bezos\nMark Zuckerberg\u00a0\nTim Ferriss\nMarie Forleo\u00a0\nGary Vaynerchuk\u00a0\nCasey Neistat\u00a0\nBen Thompson\u00a0\nPeter Thiel\u00a0\n\n\ud83d\udc26 You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:\n\nCorey Maass\nCory Miller (CEO, Post Status)\nOlivia Bisset (Intern, Post Status)\n\nThe Post Status Draft podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. \ud83d\udcddBrowse our archives, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe via iTunes, Google Podcasts, YouTube, Stitcher, Simplecast, or RSS. \ud83c\udfa7\nTranscript\nSession 11 Corey & Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live\nCory Miller: [00:00:00] Um, we are on session 11, and this is gonna be a fun one. We\u2019re kind of in rebooting. Last week we talked about, um, blew out the vision and see all the options. And then, um, got some good stuff there. And now I think next step is, um, drum roll. Taking a lane.\u00a0 \nCorey Maass: Yes. Uh, you know, when in, when in, we are a startup, right? \u2028\nLike we, we ride razor scooters around our office. Uh, we have a kegerator in our co-working space. String lights. We have string lights, like all the cool kids. Um, we are pivoting. Pivoting is what you do. Oh, there you go.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: Um, I think we talked about, uh, Silicon Valley on H B O [00:01:00] and uh, I actually had a yellow Ford Escape. \u2028\nI was driving. It was my commuter car. And uh, it was funny, my team was making fun of me about it cuz uh, ATO, Avi\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Aviato. \u2028\nWell, so yeah, the, I think, and I think last time we summarized a bit about how we\u2019ve arrived here, where the idea came from. Um, and so I, I have a couple of updates that I could start with. Um, the first is, I. Released, uh, an update of Crop Express, um, the, our, our legacy product, um, and or our lead gen product or what have you, um, that now has, uh, there was a, I had not successfully, correctly [00:02:00] implemented the constraints. \u2028\nSize constraints. And so that is fixed. Um, and it also now has the, our updated readme that you and I put together from the last call or the call before. Um, and so to me, I want to add one more feature that we had talked about, which was basically a, a, um, power user bypass. Because I even at one point I was like, oh, I, you know, I need an, uh, a circle image cropped, let me quick use my own tool. \u2028\nAnd I went in and it like, you know what it output was, I don\u2019t remember. 2000 or something. And I was like, wait, this isn\u2019t, this isn\u2019t what I want. Like, I want to be able to say, you know, real quick, like we talked about, use it anywhere. Like, just make it a thousand, you know? And so I\u2019m gonna add, um, a simple dropdown. \u2028\nI think what I [00:03:00] wanna do is, Like, first of all, it doesn\u2019t tell you anywhere in the cropper what it, what size it\u2019s gonna output it at. Um, uh, you know, you\u2019ve potentially set that in the setting screen, but you haven\u2019t, you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re actually cropping. And so I want to add that. And then what I think I\u2019m gonna do is add it as a dropdown. \u2028\nSo it\u2019s like this, you know, based on your settings, this is going to export as 2000 by 2000 or a thousand by a thousand or whatever. But in the dropdown I\u2019ll have essentially like two x, three x four x, you know, 0.75 x 0.5 x. So it\u2019ll be, you know, in the dropdown it\u2019s like, this is going to export at 2000, but from the dropdown you can say 1000 and then bang, um, or something like that. \u2028\nSo it\u2019s just real simple. And then, um, and then if we want to, we can, you know, or total customize and put in, [00:04:00] you can put in. Whatever crazy numbers you want, but the idea of being, you know, quick and easy, you can do something slightly different or proportionately different, logically different.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: Hey, gimme one second. \u2028\nI forgot to do this. \u2028\nCorey Maass: Sorry. So we start over? Yeah, no, it\u2019s fine. Um, yeah, so often awesome\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: confirmation cuz like, you value the product that you built, we did together, right? Um, enough to go, I\u2019m using it, I want to keep using it. And I think that\u2019s invaluable from a product perspective. Like mm-hmm you what, what\u2019s there and want to make it, hone it for your own thing, which I think is such a great origin for any product. \u2028\nCorey Maass: Well, and the whole eat your own dog food kind of situation of like, you know, I don\u2019t want to open Photoshop and add a circle and da da. Like, this should just be easy. Yeah. Um, so, um, with [00:05:00] that, the other, the other thing I wanna do, but I is of lower importance at the moment is to redo Crop Express the website so that it, um, has all the new features and is set up the way we want it. \u2028\nBut I think that\u2019ll be a, a weekend hackathon slightly down the road since we are deemphasizing this, the website of it, implementation of it is further deemphasized. Um, so that\u2019s that. And then, um, let me actually share my screen. \u2028\nShare. You see that? All right? Yeah. Okay, so, um, so as we talked about, I had gone somewhat far down the path of, uh, building a plugin that works against, uh, [00:06:00] screenshot Express, which is the screenshot SAS service, a API that I built. Um, so you\u2019ll see reference to social images, which was just sort of the project name, um, that I started with. \u2028\nUm, but I\u2019m, I\u2019m so, um, me and my crazy colors, oops, sorry about the dogs. Um, me and my crazy eighties colors. Um, there\u2019s screenshot express, so I\u2019m actually pretty, um, pleased with myself, uh, with the implementation that I built initially. So, um, So here\u2019s what we have so far, essentially is, um, by activating this, it, it should throw you to a welcome screen. \u2028\nIt currently doesn\u2019t, um, but it has this very cool, like the colors of the app. Um, and so you can either sign up for an account or you can log in. Um, [00:07:00] so naturally I\u2019m going to just log in. Um, hopefully you can\u2019t see my passwords.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: Um, \u2028\nCorey Maass: it signs you in. Um, it shows you what active licenses you have. If you have one already, um, you hit select and then great. It\u2019s all saved. So that\u2019s the onboarding. And obviously like that\u2019s purely technical, but that\u2019s, you know, all the steps involved with connecting yourself to the screenshot express service. \u2028\nUm, and so obviously up for much debate between the two of us, like how we wanna, what we want to call it, how much we wanna obfuscate that we\u2019re actually using screenshot express, behind the scenes, all that stuff. But at least technically there it is. Um, and then, um, I ripped [00:08:00] out some of the stuff that I had, um, but I think you can, we can sort of illustrate at least the, what we\u2019ve got in mind here. \u2028\nUm, and this is where I, I wanted to start talking through with you. Um, A first imagined workflow, right? So that in my mind, here\u2019s how this works, right? So you\u2019re like, I write a blog post and array block editor. Um, and then presumably you\u2019d save draft or you\u2019d publish, but let\u2019s just publish for the sake of it, right? \u2028\nUm, and then you\u2019re like, okay, now I want to promote my blog post. Um, oh, let me add a featured image, upload a file, um, testing nice pretty [00:09:00] landscape set featured image update. I don\u2019t, this might work. This might not work. But anyway, um, so it\u2019s like you\u2019ve got a published blog post and then you say to yourself, okay, now I want to create. \u2028\nImages for sharing this to on Twitter and Facebook. Um, and so what I have so far in here, I have to go start, uh, whoops. Open. \u2028\nIt\u2019s always fun doing it. Live tech demo. N p m, \u2028\nno, of course this will work. \u2028\nCory Miller: I\u2019m trying to write some notes too when we get there. Um, \u2028\nCorey Maass: oh. \u2028\nOkay, not you. Next. CSS js. [00:10:00] Oh, welcome. Okay. Why are you not just working? \u2028\nCory Miller: This is real life. Does this sound good?\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Um, \u2028\nit is real, real life social images. I am in the right place. Um, I have the stuff that I was deleting. Uh, it\u2019s not admin, its build. \u2028\nI dunno. This should just work. \u2028\nCory Miller: Um, while you\u2019re doing that, I\u2019m. I\u2019m thinking about what you\u2019d want in the end product. Mm-hmm. The basic. Mm-hmm. \u2028\nCorey Maass: So plugin. Oh, I didn\u2019t activate the plugin. Oh no, I did. It\u2019s there. [00:11:00] Um, oh gosh. I don\u2019t know. Okay, so whatever. Um, but the idea is, um, wait, I really wanted to show this to you. I frame, \u2028\nCory Miller: go ahead. You, you keep looking. \u2028\nCorey Maass: Oh, that\u2019s what it was. I totally changed this. I totally changed this. Okay, so, um, so there\u2019s no currently no menu item, but, um, because what I had changed was started doing it all in React and JavaScript, but I was like, you know what, let\u2019s just do this in, in an easier way. So like that, that whole welcome screen is actually like, you\u2019re actually hitting a button in the page, reloads. \u2028\nAnd it\u2019s not the like cool Ajay way to do it, but who cares? It works. So, um, so let\u2019s see. We do actually build, Hey there. It\u2019s, so the idea being that, you know, somewhere on this screen you\u2019re like, okay, it\u2019s. [00:12:00] Ready to go or you know, here\u2019s my blog post. There\u2019s a big button somewhere. Or I had had it up here in the menu item that was like, you know, social images. \u2028\nSo it\u2019s like, okay, you\u2019re ready to go now build your social images so it takes you to a screen, um, where something like this, right, like this is a dashboard. Um, so we can actually create these things. Um, Instagram card. Right. So like you\u2019ve got things that you\u2019re building and the idea being that you\u2019re choosing a channel, which is what\u2019s, so channel being Twitter, Facebook, something like that. \u2028\nObviously we will introduce custom ones, but this is what defines the size, right? So like if it\u2019s Twitter, 1300 by 900, no, 1600 by 900, if it\u2019s Instagram, 10 80 by 10 80. Um, and then we\u2019ve also got templates. And so right now I think I [00:13:00] only have, uh, like a simple. Simple one implemented. Um, but the idea is you then it takes you to an edit screen, right? \u2028\nSo we are on, here\u2019s my blog post. Um, and I need to, I need a name for what these are called. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re called. Um, but you\u2019ve got, um, you know, the template that you\u2019ve started with, um, and you should be able to change this as you go. It\u2019s like, oh, right, I\u2019m no, I actually want this for Facebook or whatever. \u2028\nRight? And the template is, um, again, your starting point, but you\u2019ve got the idea of being that you then got whatever\u2019s customizable is this is your preview on the right. So again, here\u2019s my blog post that was pulled in from the blog post, right? If you want the featured image as the background. Well, I didn\u2019t implement that, so that\u2019s not showing, but that\u2019s what would show, you know, in the background. \u2028\nWhat I do have implemented is, um, if you wanted to show the ti the. The date of the post. [00:14:00] Yeah. Um, right. If you wanted to add a background color, let\u2019s just make it red, right? So pretend your, you know, your featured image isn\u2019t there. You can change the font. Um, you can change the size, right? So basically, like, based off of a template you would customize, um, what this looks like. \u2028\nSo, you know, this is obviously not an accurate representation cuz we\u2019re saying it\u2019s Instagram, but pretend it\u2019s Twitter, it\u2019s the right proportions. You\u2019ve got it customized on the right and then you, and then you\u2019d hit a button that says print essentially, you know, stamp it, create it. Whatever that looks like. \u2028\nAnd then, um, you can go back to your dashboard and we would have the preview of it, um, as it was created. And so then here, or any, anywhere there\u2019s a button that says download, you know, if it\u2019s Twitter, then you\u2019ve got a share directly to Twitter button, upload it to [00:15:00] Buffer kind of thing. \u2028\nCool. \u2028\nSo that\u2019s the very clunky version. But you know, again, the, the, the walkthrough that I\u2019m starting to picture is you create a, um, anything you create in here in WordPress, a post, a page, you then have a button that says, okay, use data from this to populate a template. So it\u2019s the page title, copy excerpt. Um, You know, featured image, and then you bang through a bunch of templates, you\u2019re like, oh, there\u2019s a, the simple template that has the title on the bottom and the featured image is a background. \u2028\nYou\u2019ve got the card template that\u2019s got the featured image above and the title below. You\u2019ve got the, um, the Post Status template that, you know, you automatically inserts your logo on the left and your featured image on the right [00:16:00] with a title down below. You\u2019ve got the whatev, what\u2019s the other one we looked at? \u2028\nUm, Freemeus template, that\u2019s got the flip art, you know, featured image on the right and the title on the left, and lots of white space, whatever, whatever. Um, you know, and you and each one, I guess I\u2019m picturing, have you used, um, migrate DB Pro from Delicious Brains years ago? Yeah. Um, So they\u2019ve got this real, you know, if you\u2019re, um, so it\u2019s, you know, migrating data from one site to another. \u2028\nSo you go in and you say, start a new migration, and you plug in the credentials and you plug in your settings. And so you, at any point you can say, go do the migration, push the data, pull the data, um, or you can save this as a template so that you can, you know, go in regularly and say, pull in the data from the site, pull in the data, you know, it\u2019s a new day. \u2028\nPull in the n the fresh data. And so I\u2019m picturing that kind of flow where, [00:17:00] um, you know, if, if all you need is, um, if all you need is a Twitter image, then click, click, click and you\u2019ve got one. Um, but you know, while you\u2019re in here, if you\u2019ve got all this configured, there\u2019s a button that says Save this, you know, as a template for every post. \u2028\nAnd so then the next time you come in here, you know, uh, create a thing from scratch or load your. You know, send it to Corey\u2019s Twitter template, bang. And it, but again, it pulls in that post data populates your template. So it\u2019s like your, your Post Status template where it\u2019s like you\u2019d set it up once with a logo on the left and your featured image on the right, you\u2019d hit save. \u2028\nThis is the Post Status, um, you know, person profile template. And then every time you just come in, drag that down and it automatically throw it on the screen. You could tweak it a little if you needed to, if the title was too long or something, and then hit print and then you\u2019ve got that image. \u2028\nCool.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: [00:18:00] So yeah, from a workflow standpoint, I think that\u2019s very, uh, understandable. But this is around like a broader question that leads back to that, um, like the open graph and things like that. So, you know, when you paste the link into Slack or you paste it into Facebook or whatever that is, Um, it\u2019s pulling some data back from the website,\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Correct . \u2028\nMost of it populated by something like Yost. Okay.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: So how does Slack, Facebook, different things know which particular image? Like when you create a post and then you put that image in there, there\u2019s multiple options and dimensions with the channels and stuff. So is that stored somewhere on the backend? \u2028\nLike if we, if someone goes, okay, I want it, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, how would that [00:19:00] automatically recognize in those platforms?\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Or does it Right? Um, yeah, we\u2019d have to look into that. Like I know that I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve played with another tool before that generated an open graph image for your blog post. Um, and. \u2028\nThey, I don\u2019t remember if it worked or not. I feel like it didn\u2019t work the way I wanted it to, but it, um, it hooked into Yost. So if you had Yost running, you didn\u2019t have to say, generate an image and then download an image and then upload an image into Yost. There was a way that it was like that image was saved to the media library. \u2028\nAnd then, um, and then Yost, there was a hook somewhere, I\u2019m sure in Yost, cuz they\u2019re real good about that. That said, for the social image point at this one. Or maybe they, they, you know, maybe they updated the metadata, the Yost metadata or something like that. But, [00:20:00] um, but yeah, that\u2019s, it\u2019s like I, you know, this is this, like what I just showed is broadly the. \u2028\nUm, how we generate images, right? But I think like one of the onboarding things, kind of like Yost walks you through site basics, right? Like we would have some sort of onboarding as part, you know, connect to, to screenshot express. But then like, what do you want to buy? What do, what do you want your defaults to be? \u2028\nCreate? And it\u2019s honestly like, it would be a great, um, user onboarding because it\u2019s like, okay, we\u2019re gonna create, you know, every website full stop needs a default o OG open graph image. So let\u2019s show you our little template builder and you\u2019re gonna build your first template. You know, that\u2019s your default website homepage, open graph image. \u2028\nDone, saved. [00:21:00] And then you can also save this as the default template that\u2019ll get used for every post. But instead of pulling in the name of your website, it\u2019ll pull in the name of your post done. And so if you check a box, um, then every post you create, you know, we can have it. Whenever you somehow indicate that you\u2019ve published, you\u2019re ready, then it\u2019ll automatically create that open graph image by default. \u2028\nUm, and or, you know, any of these things we can get. I ideally you\u2019d get to a point where, um, you know, you publish a post, you click, okay, I\u2019m ready to promote it. There\u2019s a good word. Like the next stage after creating a thing, a post, a page is to promote it, market it, whatever. You know, click a click here to generate all of the images you\u2019ve already set up or add new ones or if, you know, if you wanna do it manually every time you can. \u2028\nBut we could, we could automate a lot of that stuff so that it\u2019s, you [00:22:00] know, cuz it, yeah, once you get down the road aways, it\u2019s like the clients that I have that are publishing articles, you know, once or twice a day, presumably they, they might, they would spot check these things, these images created, but, um, but the likely the idea, ideally the, you know, they would click a button and an OG image would be created. \u2028\nAnd also like, if they open that dashboard screen, then it\u2019s just like, download your Twitter image, download your, or click here to, to download all of them as a zip to then send to the social media manager or something like that.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: So the reason I was asking is related back to workflow too. So you go, like, you, you hit on it. \u2028\nWhere I was thinking there is like, there\u2019s a, there\u2019s a site specific open graph thing that just gets populated and then each post has, uh, a nuance of [00:23:00] that kind. I mean, we\u2019re kind of thinking like a thumbnail in a sense, but like for the social images, um, and back down the workflow, I almost go like, again, not knowing the technical part of this, but I go from a workflow standpoint. \u2028\nYou created your blog post, you start your build thing and like you don\u2019t even select a channel. It\u2019s like here\u2019s all like here\u2019s LinkedIn, here\u2019s Twitter, here\u2019s Facebook. Yes, here\u2019s Google things. And they\u2019re already there and generated not even if you\u2019re gonna like repost on LinkedIn or. Share, but like they\u2019re already generated because maybe somebody does share your image on LinkedIn, not you. \u2028\nRight. And you want that to show up nicely. Yeah. Um, so that was just my thought is like, first I go, oh, that\u2019s cool. He is already thought through all the channels, but then I was like, workflow wise, I just want \u2019em built for me. And maybe I\u2019m editing some of those.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Yeah. We, [00:24:00] you know, I think we define some friendly default and in an onboarding or a setup, we say, you know, by default we are creating, you know, Facebook being Facebook, they didn\u2019t name it anything. \u2028\nThey named it Open graph. Twitter came along second, so they have to call it a Twitter card. Um, They\u2019ll be out of business soon. So it doesn\u2019t really matter. But, um, but it\u2019s like, you know, in the onboarding, we\u2019ll say like, by default, do you want to j Auto generate Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram for each thing you create, yes or no, just toggle using a default, a sensible default. \u2028\nAnd then you can customize that template.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: So I think about this with our Slack community because it comes in and like, it never looks the way we wanted to, and I just go, okay, [00:25:00] we can talk about the user options at some point, but I go, I would want every channel, uh, reasonable channel created because you don\u2019t know if someone\u2019s gonna put that into Slack or something else. \u2028\nCorey Maass: True, true, true.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: For the most popular networks. So like, even if you\u2019re not using it, you think about your visitors and you go, it want, you want it to show up nice and, and look nice. Um, so that was my, that\u2019s my thinking when I saw that is like, no matter what, this comes back to open graph, like how it, we create those and then they get tagged appropriately with open graph in, in that post. \u2028\nUm, I think would be an excellent work focus. Then we could say for the product standpoint, it generates this on, you know, automatically for all the, so that your site looks professional, right? Any, you know, any edge case that\u2019s gonna happen. You\u2019ve made in the design, you know, [00:26:00] automation almost, and then post by post, they can, they can edit this, but I like that mindset because then we can say, I was, I was looking up open graph, um, as you were talking just to kind of understand that more. \u2028\nAnd, um, I saw some, some little sample images that came in. I thought, okay, there\u2019s some cool ideas here. Um, what we\u2019re doing. If, if we look at the bigger view and this, I\u2019m, I\u2019m really, this is tied back down to this workflow. What we\u2019re trying to accomplish is, uh, an easy way to demonstrate an image or some concept of, this is my website where I have done this thing for you. \u2028\nIt\u2019s like a presentation. And, um, some of the images, I was like, oh, there\u2019s so cool design ideas. But you think about it like, we\u2019ll go way back to product mockups and like iPhone mockups. You know how they always tilt [00:27:00] \u2019em. Mm-hmm. And I think we\u2019re trying to do here, the essence of it is we have a website we do a lot of content for. \u2028\nAnd when we present that in the social channels or wherever it is, we want people to know this is an entity, this is a brand thing. Like, it\u2019s as silly as the little iPhone mockup when it, you know, or remember those 3D book covers. It\u2019s that 3d. Same. Oh yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It\u2019s all 3D book covers you created, you know, 3D book cover of any PDF you had. \u2028\nIt\u2019s like almost in that sense. This is a website called Post or whatever. And you know, let me show you this real quick, \u2028\nbut see, like this right here. See how it\u2019s got the little top shadow? Yep. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s how we do it design wise, but the intention is like these little dots are kind of a signal of this is a website, this is, you know, even, even some of the [00:28:00] updates, like I guess that\u2019s Facebook, but you\u2019re like, those are some interesting design thoughts for the templates. \u2028\nMm-hmm. But see, that kind of thinking is you just made me professional on things I hadn\u2019t even thought about. Yeah. Because you get to the other side and you see. Um, just like when we went live on Goda or YouTube, it\u2019s got the default old Post Status logo and you\u2019re like, what you really want is some semblance of branding for the website. \u2028\nMm-hmm. And the content. So like this one right here kind of speaks more to the idea of what I\u2019m talking about is like, that could be a template. Like we could\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Right. Well search for right where you are, search for open graph image template, like in, in, in the Google box at the top, like, uh, image template. \u2028\nShould get a bunch of stuff about [00:29:00] tags, \u2028\nbut nothing too compelling. But yeah, I, I love what, where you\u2019re going. Like we could.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: Like this right here is, you know, there\u2019s just a frame, like the image. Mm-hmm. I was thinking of it as like, I don\u2019t know, but there\u2019s a frame to the image we create. It\u2019s kind of like displaying, this is on my website. This is Phil website, and I\u2019m presenting it to you where like, you know, this, I mean, even the Facebook thing, this is kind of ubiquitous with like, there\u2019s a name, there\u2019s a logo. \u2028\nYep. There\u2019s a, there\u2019s something here. There\u2019s an image like this, this template format. It\u2019s pretty standard. People get that. Yep. But even if you did something like logo, something like to give it a fill of this is on the web or something. Yeah, well, like the browser bar kind of thing, I guess.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Well, [00:30:00] and, and, and you can, I mean, my, my intention is I. \u2028\nLike, I don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t want to compete with Canva, and I don\u2019t want to get into that technical, I don\u2019t wanna go that deep. Um, at least for a long time. We can\u2019t of like drag and drop, but we can. But I\u2019ve made it very, very easy to create templates. Um, and, um, and the intent is to use the, um, you know, uh, who does it, WooCommerce or, um, E D D or, um, any number of the big plugins. \u2028\nYou can, you can copy a template out of a plugin, put it in your theme, and then it\u2019ll get incorporated into the plugin. So it\u2019s like, you know, VVA from FIUs is like, Nope, none of these templates do what I need. Um, you know, let me create my own. And so he is, he\u2019s got a little, his little robot that\u2019s, you know, pointing at. \u2028\nAt a browser that has a screenshot of the [00:31:00] website built in, just like you said, um, or the little, you know, avatar of, of the author with their little byline, um, already built in. And, um, and incorporate those into, you know, every template that you, uh, that you create. And subsequently every screenshot of every or every social image that you create for anything. \u2028\nCory Miller: I\u2019m on this because we\u2019ve been, like, I was just telling you I was at trying to do a frame for this, but I go, that\u2019s really what we\u2019re capturing. When you create a piece of do something, you, you package it up with a frame and then like, I\u2019m just roughing this out cause I don\u2019t have like any InDesign skills, but you go, there\u2019s a frame up here that shows like, \u2028\nKind of to, to this or this one using that. And then this is just the bar [00:32:00] that says this is a package thing. Then maybe, you know, \u2028\nI\u2019m only diving into this cause I really think it, this could be really simple formula to start that would mm-hmm. Really greatly enhance anything I\u2019ve done. Um, okay. So site logo. Yep. Name, you know, that kind of goes up there and then, \u2028\nand then down here. \u2028\nWe know this be meta description maybe, or something like that. Or, uh, excerpt.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Excerpt. Yep. \u2028\nCory Miller: But like, if you think about that from the, just these elements for a second, right? Like, we packaged that up in a way that fills like this or mm-hmm. Like, don\u2019t, we\u2019re not in the Canva game. I mean, maybe you go do that or [00:33:00] maybe you just put it in the stock image. \u2028\nBut that goes here, we pull this from , pull that from . There\u2019s a link in there. You\u2019ve got some simple branding. Oops. \u2028\nI\u2019m trying to find the image to copy it. Cause I. \u2028\nLike that\u2019s up here \u2028\nand everybody gets to see my awesome. \u2028\nBut yeah, like in this, we\u2019d only have to generate something like this. Like I could think we could get this lightly styled. Very right, very lightly styled. Pull in their logo name, have the big image here, and like I think that, \u2028\nI mean, gosh, that right there, Corey. Is a significant enhancement to anything most people are doing. It\u2019s not custom, like, like these we\u2019re seeing here where [00:34:00] someone, you know, has a full-time team doing this kind of stuff, but like, then we let them be creative with their own images. Hey, we\u2019re not in that game. \u2028\nWe\u2019re in this game of packaging this content. \u2028\nAnd I mean, it\u2019s like, you know, the, the Facebook one is the, this is the frame up here. That\u2019s just the image. And this is just the title tag, headline, and description. Yep. That right there would significantly professionalize what we\u2019re doing, you know? Mm-hmm. Uh, and then we\u2019d have to stylize the, uh, generic one. \u2028\nCorey Maass: Yep. And that\u2019s what I was trying to illustrate with like, so what you\u2019d saw on the right of my little demo is, you know, the, the title of the blog post featured image in the back. So that\u2019s like, that\u2019s one, that\u2019s one template. Right. And this kind of [00:35:00] thing would be another, or wrapped in a browser. Um, a fake browser would be another. \u2028\nAnd you know, so it\u2019s, and if they\u2019re simple to create, mostly done in, um, c s s, then it\u2019s just a matter of somebody, me or you, or both of us, like essentially cranking these out. I mean, we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t want to overwhelm. The point is not to have a gajillion templates, at least not to start with, but a few sensible defaults that, like you said, give gives everybody their initial leg up. \u2028\nSo like right out of the box, you\u2019ve got a sensible default, something to work with. \u2028\nCory Miller: Sorry, I can\u2019t help myself. \u2028\nBy the way, the circle logo, you can create with Crop Express. \u2028\nCorey Maass: Give your big image of background color. \u2028\nCory Miller: When we first started doing that, I couldn\u2019t remember how to do that. \u2028\n[00:36:00] Yep, there you go. \u2028\nI mean, even if you took the frame off. \u2028\nWe probably want to play with these and see how they looked in the different social platforms, but,\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: right. Well, and that\u2019s, and that\u2019s the, the joy of this. So it\u2019s, you know, so there\u2019s, right now, like I just looked, LinkedIn uses, um, Facebook\u2019s OG image, um, Instagram you can\u2019t import. And so outta the box, we\u2019re only talking about two. \u2028\nWe\u2019re talking about Facebook\u2019s OG image and Twitter card image. So whatever their specs are. Um, and again, because it\u2019s, we\u2019re screenshotting, H T M L, it\u2019s responsive. And so presumably you can use the same mo the same template. Yeah. You know, for both. And it\u2019s like, okay, well no, I, I don\u2019t want, I don\u2019t want the, the Corey template. \u2028\nI want the Corey. [00:37:00] Template. It doesn\u2019t work. Our names are the same. I don\u2019t want the, the Corey template, I want the Miller template. And that one\u2019s got a black background. You know, it\u2019s black on white, so it\u2019s like your themes on the right there, it\u2019s like one is black on white, one is white on black, one is gray with, you know, little colors on it. \u2028\nUm, and so you\u2019re like, that\u2019s what all of my images look like for every post I create. It automatically creates a, um, Facebook or an OG image and a Twitter image. Um, as soon as I hit publish or even before, if I click a button and say, generate based on what\u2019s, you know, the information that\u2019s here. Um, and then like you said, as soon as somebody shares it, drops it into Slack, um, shares it via Twitter, Facebook, whatever, like, it\u2019ll, it\u2019ll pull in those, the image you want that\u2019s been generated that is more than just your featured image. \u2028\nAnd then, yeah, we get into this kind of stuff where it\u2019s like, [00:38:00] what are all of the d you know, these, this is where I guess the channels thing comes in, right? Like, so a channel could not only be, um, you know, technically, like Instagram is a, is a channel, but Instagram has stories which are a vertical 16 by nine to traditional Instagram, which is square. \u2028\nUm, you know, you can, you can share horizontal, vertical, or square on Twitter, LinkedIn Carousel is gonna have their own thing. Um, you know, what\u2019s, what\u2019s the optimal, you\u2019re in Google Slides, what\u2019s the optimal Google slide? Size and shape, like, so we can. Basically that\u2019s where we once, once we have the, the way to present templates, we can go crazy creating templates for every single channel and every, every scenario. \u2028\nYeah,\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: I was just [00:39:00] thinking too, the option where you don\u2019t have an image, but it creates one, an open graph type image for you. Mm-hmm. And what you want.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Um, \u2028\nwell, and this is where we, um, um, we had talked about too, like, uh, you could have a template that looks at the content of the story for anything that\u2019s in a block quote and pulls out the first block quote or pulls out every block quote and, and generates an image for each of those quotes. So now you\u2019ve got. \u2028\nIf you\u2019ve got three block quotes, you\u2019ve now got three images that are all sized and stylized for Twitter. And so then you say, okay, post this one today, this one tomorrow, and this one on Thursday \u2028\nCory Miller: capture. This is just me capturing this. \u2028\nLike yeah. Even if it hadn\u2019t open quote, like you don\u2019t really have an image, but you have a powerful quote in [00:40:00] here. CSS can use some brain, like whatever your default site right is. Yeah.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Then it pull. I love that. You know, some basic styling. It\u2019s pulling in your, I mean, Mo um, WordPress Customizer has a place for a logo so we can reach for it there, and otherwise we can say, specify a logo to use across all your templates. \u2028\nUm, And it\u2019ll auto-populate. And then you can obviously drill down and, and customize each one as you, as you mess with it. Um, oras or mess with it as much as you want to. \u2028\nAnd so, um, so backing up, up, up, I\u2019m creating a system for customizing a couple of templates to start with manually. And your, [00:41:00] let\u2019s start with featured image kind of comment here to me, which I\u2019m, I\u2019m a hundred percent on board with, is the ability to set one of those essentially as a default so that it\u2019s auto-generated so that the moment you hit publish your story has a handsome OG image. \u2028\nAnd we\u2019ll see about hooking that into Yost or what have you. And then we can continue to take it further. Cuz it\u2019s like, yeah, let\u2019s, let\u2019s at least cover the basics base. Let\u2019s cover the bases. Me and my sports metaphors. You\u2019re that guy. Um, let\u2019s at least do the basic of generating an an OG image, um, which is for better or worse, is the couple of other plug-ins or products that I\u2019ve seen. \u2028\nThat\u2019s where they start. Um, but they also end there. So it\u2019s like, great, let\u2019s take it further than that of generating a Twitter card [00:42:00] image, but then also any other image you want. The, the workflow will start to get a little clunky because you are going to have to do something with those images. Upload them to buffer or. \u2028\nUpload them manually to Twitter or whatever, but at least those images exist, at least based off of, um, WordPress post data and a template. A template or templates that you\u2019ve presumably built once and then said, save you can, the next time you publish a post, you hit, generate all these images, download a zip, and then you\u2019re not, you don\u2019t have to go to Canva and you don\u2019t have to tweak, tweak, tweak or copy, you know, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, and tweak and insert your own data and stuff. \u2028\nThey\u2019re just, they\u2019re just there. Yeah.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: Well, like, uh, sorry, I, I was thinking too, here, here\u2019s where I\u2019m going with this too, is [00:43:00] I would imagine if we can create a, you know, my site, let\u2019s say has 500 posts on there with no social images. Ooh. See where I\u2019m going? Yeah. Install and it gives you a base, nicely styled, professional enough thing that can go backwards. \u2028\nYep. Oh, now you\u2019ve just made shit ton of work. Extremely easy and increased their professionalism. So what I was just doing was thinking about the Sitewide thing. It\u2019s like it\u2019s just a simple business card, you know? Yep. Here\u2019s the logo, here\u2019s the site, here\u2019s our tagline. Like that might be it. Yep. Just what we\u2019ve done, but we\u2019ve hundred Xed this thing that exists that, you know, you go to all these sites and you\u2019re like, God, they\u2019ve got a whole team doing this stuff. \u2028\nMm-hmm. We just hadn\u2019t gone, boom, there\u2019s\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: value, man. Oh, huge. And that\u2019s [00:44:00] like, that to me is, um, Uh, another Delicious Brain\u2019s product, the Offload s3. Um, and the free version lets you start today. The pro version among other things, lets you go, go back and essentially catch up.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: See, and that\u2019s killer. I mean, imagine all these, okay, now we\u2019ve hit our huge value prop because imagine all the WordPress website maintenance companies that go, by the way, we noticed your, your site is just not displaying too professionally. \u2028\nWe\u2019re gonna install this and click it and it\u2019s done. Yep. Holy shit.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: I mean, and even, even taking that a little further, like if I\u2019m. Excuse me, I\u2019m the agency. I come in or I\u2019m the developer. I come in, I\u2019m like, you know, yeah, I\u2019m, I\u2019m building this thing for [00:45:00] you, but, um, we\u2019re updating this thing for you. But like you said, I\u2019ve noticed that, you know, a lot of these old pages don\u2019t have these images, whatever. \u2028\nUm, I come in and I set styles. It\u2019s like, what\u2019s, what\u2019s, like you said, what\u2019s your logo? What\u2019s your, um, brand colors? What\u2019s your, you know, and so then it\u2019s um, it\u2019s all on brand too. \u2028\nCory Miller: It\u2019s all on brand. And then like I meant any B2B site, so when it shows up, they might go \u2028\nlike right there. They put incredible fingertip address. Like all the addresses. I mean, this is just nothing but a business card for your website, right? I\u2019m gonna capture that for marketing. \u2028\nCorey Maass: Um, and then, and then [00:46:00] WooCommerce, right? So, so every, every product you already have on your website, it just goes back through and, and populates and you know it, like we\u2019ve said pre in a, in a previous call, um, you know, product image, bullet points. You probably don\u2019t wanna do price, but you know, if you\u2019ve got an if, if each of your products has bullet points or has reviews. \u2028\nSo picture of image. Title of em or title of product, sorry, picture of product, title of product, 400 reviews, five stars and an excerpt. This widget is the best widget, you know, \u2028\nwhat do you do? What do you see? If[00:47:00]\u00a0 \u2028\nI go to Amazon, I want share this backpack, copy link. I go over to Post Status. I can find Corey. I say, this is the backpack I\u2019m looking at. \u2028\nWhat does it do? What does it do? Apparently nothing. \u2028\nIt just takes something to populate. \u2028\nNothing. I feel like maybe slack\u2019s being slow or something. Oops. \u2028\nOkay. So do you wanna share your window or all? No, I don\u2019t have anything to share. I was just seeing, I, I went and grabbed a URL from Amazon and pasted it into Post Status. Um, To you to see what it would populate with, but it [00:48:00] didn\u2019t actually populate anything. \u2028\nCory Miller: Um, you know, a basic business card for your website basically is what we\u2019re doing. And then the on top of that is, you know, something like this, \u2028\nCorey Maass: right? Yeah, exactly. And that\u2019s what I mean by like, so part of the onboarding, which I think would be great cuz it helps people get set up is, you know, upload a logo or specify where a logo is. I mean, Yost does the same thing. Um, and, and so you, you, it\u2019ll, it\u2019ll give you the data points that it\u2019ll give us the data, give the plugin the data points that it needs to build a sensible default. \u2028\nAnd, and so much. And then that\u2019s your starting point for, you know, every time you wanna share, share a post, you know, start here. Well, no, this one actually [00:49:00] has a, a featured image. Let\u2019s put that in. Or, you know, if it\u2019s a, uh, you know, this is your business card for your website, but then, you know, it\u2019s a woo commerce shop, so you actually want products. \u2028\nSo it\u2019s like, then you\u2019d say, okay, we\u2019ll copy this, this business card template, but then, you know, add, show the featured image or something \u2028\nand doing,\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: I mean, doing that, cross the website, um, huge, like 10 times better than what you have. A hundred times better than you have just with some basic, like I\u2019m talk I, when I did the Google search with the business card, I said, simple, modern business card. That\u2019s your favicon, or you upload your own little image. \u2028\nYou got, that\u2019s your site title, that\u2019s your site tagline. Maybe that\u2019s edible. And then you add in your little information. I mean,\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: yeah. [00:50:00] Yeah. And, and the default, you know, is all of these sites will go and grab, you know, ideally there\u2019s an OG image, and so you are creating one in Canva and reimporting it, um, or you, um, or it\u2019s trying to grab the first image on the page. \u2028\nSo usually that\u2019s the featured image. It\u2019s like, like we said, you know what, what kind of started this whole conversation a month ago now between you and I is the, like, better than a featured image put, put some bullet points on it, put the title, put the, you know, um, whatever, whatever, whatever other data points you can add so that when they share it, it\u2019s not just an image. \u2028\nAn abstract image. Oh, it\u2019s a widget. It\u2019s like, oh no, it\u2019s a widget that has these benefits. Buy it on this website.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: So an over graph question is, we we\u2019re talking about generating the HTML snapshot and then making it, or [00:51:00] across the site, but we do have the h html sitting there too. Mm-hmm. I don\u2019t know how Op grf does that, but, but for what looks like, it seems like it\u2019s an image, but I mean, we still have the H M L code code rendered somewhere. \u2028\nYep. Okay. So this right here. Oh, I just wanted to go down there to see. Okay. There\u2019s something here. Basically the value prop is overnight flesh out in a more professional manner. Your open graph, social distributions, I mean, I\u2019d go back to something like this if I don\u2019t have a featured image, which I don\u2019t on most of my blog posts, and, um, it\u2019ll just pull a simple image that looks a little, it\u2019s a treatment. \u2028\nLike we\u2019ve been talking about the images. What are you truly trying to do is just show its image. [00:52:00] And if you set your defaults, like having, you know, you\u2019re like, whatever, you\u2019re, were yellow or were orange. So \u2028\nwe probably don\u2019t wanna do that, but, um Right. You know, right there. Mm-hmm. You just made something a little nicer.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Yeah. Or your, you know, logo. Logo in the top right. Or, um, you know, if there isn\u2019t a featured or, you know, and so if there\u2019s a featured image, it shows up. If there isn\u2019t, you have at least got your logo. \u2028\nUm, you know, and or the option to, um, We could even have an option that says like, if you don\u2019t have a featured image, just do a big old logo. \u2028\nCory Miller: Yeah. Like, uh, you know, the ultimate guide to social images, you knows the headline, \u2028\n[00:53:00] you know, there\u2019s that option and stuff like that. Anyway, I think there\u2019s a lot here. All that to say Yep. That with the premise of open, we know it is open graph, but it\u2019s probably not the marking side, but it\u2019s like, um, instantly create a more professional open graph presence for your entire site. \u2028\nSomething better, like these will be images too. And so like, so in that if programmatically we could say that. It\u2019ll pull your featured image into these, you know, spots and we\u2019re saving that image that automatically puts an image back into that post, right? Mm-hmm.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Oh yeah, we could do that. So use this as featured image gen generate better image replaced featured image. \u2028\nCory Miller: I mean, it\u2019s kinda like the 3D book cover. Those were just generated cuz it was all digital assets. So they wanted a visual way to [00:54:00] do that in the same sample, doing that\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: software too. Remember they start, they would show a box like you\u2019d buy at Staples, but you couldn\u2019t actually walk into Staples and buy it. \u2028\nAlbum covers T-shirts. Yeah. I mean there\u2019s, and, and there\u2019s good examples online. There\u2019s lots of little apps now that, um, you can build, um, Build the screenshots or take, take a screenshot and it puts it in a browser and puts it at a tilt, like you said. Um, like we\u2019d have to play with all that. But, um, put it in a browser wrapper, put it on an iPhone, have somebody smiling and holding it on their iPhone. \u2028\nYou know, um, yeah. All those things. Like we can, again, once, once we\u2019ve got the template builder, essentially then our imagination, as long as we can do it in H T M L, then we can create a template that does that and people can build their own too, which is what I really like. Cuz you\u2019re, [00:55:00] you\u2019re gonna have nerds like me who will look at, um, look at a couple of hours simple templates and go, oh, cool. \u2028\nLet me, let me go build my own specific to my website, my own branding, or, you know, I. Yeah, because, and then we created Marketplace and people could sell the templates and take, get a commission. We\u2019ll go crazy baby.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: Yeah. I was just trying to skip this out of, okay, the, this all seems valuable to people, uh, to me, and I think it would be, should be to other people. \u2028\nAnd then, like you said, it, well, I mean, one is creating an open graph image for each post. Um, sitewide in each post, what we have here. I didn\u2019t, you know, there\u2019s another benefit that we talked about. It\u2019s like, well, like for my site would instantly get a bunch of thumbnails or, you know, the book [00:56:00] cover type treatment. \u2028\nUm, then you\u2019ve just told the search engines, I\u2019ve got new image content. Mm. You\u2019ve, you\u2019ve made an update to existing posts, you know? Yep. So, That\u2019s my, maybe part three or something, but, or I don\u2019t even know. But, um, I just see that value going. Oh. Cuz you can show, people are tired of seeing, you know, crap. \u2028\nYou know, you\u2019re doing all this content work, but you\u2019re tired of seeing the social distribution, open graph stuff look like crap. This solves that problem with a click. Yep. So that\u2019s why I wanted to go down this of like, where, I mean, this right here, there\u2019s a pot of gold here. I mean, if you don\u2019t, if you have great content in the past, but you don\u2019t really have a lot of the strong image stuff, then use, use these two. \u2028\nYep. You know, like the table of contents [00:57:00] plug in. Mm-hmm. It\u2019ll auto generate something and then, you know, you click, click that\u2019s made, it\u2019ll pull it and then you go, yeah, sa saved whatever it is. And then now you\u2019ve added an image. Image search is what we talked about last time. Image search to a blog post with a little bit of, with some automation here. \u2028\nThat\u2019s really cool. Um, yeah. \u2028\nWith, you know, not a, doesn\u2019t seem like a ton of work for the user side. Um, maybe there\u2019s a, you know, an option here per post, which is use the excerpt, use the first block quote, find the H two s, the list or something, you know what I mean? Mm-hmm. And then you just, cuz I was trying to think from em, image\u2019s, search for a [00:58:00] second, you go, um, that\u2019s another way to get search engine traffic and visibility for your brand. \u2028\nI mean, summarize it. Look, this is, we had this conversation a couple weeks ago. Summarize your content with this kind of \u2028\nCorey Maass: Yeah. The tldr. Yeah.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: So for the template engine, I wanted to get all this cuz it\u2019s like, well these are all the ingredients that we could potentially want. So that, you know, when you start building it, like, okay, I need to, maybe for an image you can, \u2028\nuh, you know, pull, pull H two s, you know. Mm-hmm. Pull the first block, quote and that auto populates in here. \u2028\nOkay. Thank you for going all the way down there. Now back to this. Does this give some more fleshed out detail to the [00:59:00] template workflow? The. Workflow conversation.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Yeah, I\u2019m trying to think of where to start. Um, I think that the workflow that I\u2019m working on still, still works. I think we start with posts, um, and then we can implement like the sitewide version using whatever we\u2019ve defined. \u2028\nCuz it\u2019s like, to me, the post paradigm is ex the example that we will then implement everywhere. Um, so we can basically take whatever little builder I design and stick it back in the welcome. So it\u2019s like, you know, okay, connect to your, connect your account, let\u2019s create your site business card. Do you wanna then use this for all all posts? \u2028\nDo you wanna then. You know, generate, [01:00:00] generate business cards for each post retroactively. And then do you wanna get into social images? This is kind of cool cuz it\u2019s like, we\u2019re not even, in my mind it was, it was about social. Um, like I said, I\u2019d even, you know, the sort of code name for this project for me was social images. \u2028\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m, I\u2019m writing a post and then I\u2019m generating an image for Twitter or Facebook, et cetera. But we\u2019re now talking about like, there\u2019s so much other value before we even get to social. Technically. I mean, it\u2019s all technically social cuz it\u2019s about if you\u2019re sharing a post, um, than it, than it pulls in the, the featured image or what the OG image. \u2028\nBut, um, that\u2019s all, it\u2019s, it\u2019s great cuz it\u2019s all, you\u2019re covering your bases of incoming traffic and then you can go do your outbound marketing. \u2028\nThe shields are up and then you fire the torpedoes. Yeah.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: It seems [01:01:00] like, okay. Start with the sidewalk, like you said. And there\u2019s an option just to make that at the beginning, to make that if no social link or something is there, use this option, then you\u2019ve professionalized your site. Um, then you could do the per post \u2028\nYeah. Option.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: And then give us all your money if you want to go to do the past ones and or the Woo commerce add-on and or. A hundred other things. We haven\u2019t, you know, the, the marketing kit generator. So it automatically spits out Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, you know, one click generate, one click download, upload it to buffer, you know, buffer integration, um, or whatever, whatever you use to, [01:02:00] to schedule your social posts. \u2028\nCory Miller: Yeah, all those are even before getting to the post, you could say like this, just generate it through everything on the site. So there is an open graph. Mm-hmm. Image. Then when you want to tweak per post product page, whatever that is, there\u2019s maybe in post tweaking options where we can say, update from generic, there\u2019s a fallback to the site wide, and then as you want, you come in here and then we could look at which ones we do. \u2028\nWe do first.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Yep. But I like the idea of a sensible default. I was like, I\u2019m, I\u2019m picturing again, like one of my sites, client sites is a magazine that\u2019s been online for 12 years. So m half the half the posts, um, um, so many of the posts have images, random sizes and things like that. [01:03:00] Um, but they\u2019ve all at least got a title and an image and a publish date. \u2028\nSome of that\u2019s not true, but you know, like you could say, okay, so if somebody for whatever reason, shares a post from 10 years ago, it still looks basically good. Better than it, than, than it looks now where it\u2019s just a random featured image. \u2028\nCory Miller: See, I mean, Okay, so in that you go, here\u2019s this one for just the site. And then when you go to post, you\u2019re like, maybe it\u2019s some treatment like this. Like if there\u2019s a featured image, don\u2019t do the generic pull in featured image. Yep. And God, I gotta believe Corey, that the premise is if you can just make your site look professional with a click, and I think that [01:04:00] this, this right here would be the way to start. \u2028\nYeah. Like a default, A default image with an option to apply to. \u2028\nAnd then, you know, if there\u2019s a featured image in that post, go ahead and create a thumb, you know, a featured image thing. God. Right. So with that, my hypothesis would be \u2028\nstart here with, and if we can get the applied to all posts that\u2019s worth a hundred dollars, like instantly, think about how long you\u2019d have to go to update every post. But in one click you could essentially set a very nice, we\u2019d have to land the design, you know, just a really nice modern looking design, but like in one click that\u2019s not worth a hundred dollars, update your open graph. \u2028\nRight. [01:05:00] With, and even here, we\u2019ve said if, if, if a post, if post has featured image, you know, use it with X template. Mm-hmm. If you got that out, like for, for right now, my, my value pro for Post Status would be Yeah. You know? Right. Yeah. Um, then if we wanted to going forward, we could, we could look at for Post Status as a client. \u2028\nOkay. Now, ongoing, um, when V2 hits, you know, select an image right there in the post block quote,\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: uh, freeform. Yeah. I\u2019m picturing, um, a screen. It\u2019s like if we, if we can, you know, we\u2019re, we\u2019re totally blue, blue skying here. It\u2019s like, but it\u2019s, you know, generate image. I wanna generate a bunch of images. [01:06:00] A screen opens up that says, um, looks like it has a featured image. \u2028\nLooks like it has a couple of images in line, so check, check, check. So that\u2019s three. Looks like it has block quotes, you know, two block quotes. Do you want to use them? I\u2019ll you say this one and not this one, you know? And so it\u2019s like, now generate, and that\u2019s fi you know, it just spits out five, five different images and you go, oh yeah, I like this one and this one, you know, that they, it, it fits together well. \u2028\nUm, you know, but I think we can, \u2028\nwith some degree of reliability, we can, we can, we can at least try to pull stuff out. Like we featured Image for sure. Title for sure. Excerpt for sure. Um, I like your idea of, of essentially looking at H two s, um, creating an outline. And so, you know, they could just say, yep, that outline works, that\u2019s accurate or it\u2019s not. \u2028\nUm, block quotes are easy cuz they\u2019re surrounded by, if they\u2019re done right, they\u2019re H T M L, you know, [01:07:00] it\u2019s an actual block quote tag. Um, and so they can, they can basically just, you know, we say, here\u2019s your template. And then here\u2019s all the elements from the page that we\u2019ve detected, and you can add your own too, you know, now click a button to sort of put them together. \u2028\nMan, I really,\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: I really like this. I feel, I feel, when we talked about crop express, it was a thing, a utility thing. We thought we needed. We know we needed, and we think hypothesis. Everybody probably needs this mostly, and thi but that was a very tiny detail in a process, right? We just got in a workflow process. \u2028\nWe just got to a whole site value prop. Um, like just, just right here, [01:08:00] right now, my question would be, do we, do you. We\u2019re doing this from a SaaS that you\u2019ve already built in the, in the back. Like it has to take the information, send it over, snapshot it, send it back, right. It\u2019s almost a blend. Like the plugin in some sense might be some of the design stuff, but it\u2019s a plugin with a SaaS component to it. \u2028\nRight. Um, I don\u2019t know if that makes it easier, harder, whatever,\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: but, right. Well, I mean my, yeah, my, the way I\u2019d set this stuff up originally was I was like, you know, there\u2019s an API over there that obviously your average person doesn\u2019t know about, but you can put any product you want in front of it. And like, I\u2019m basically just running like a water company, electric company utility. \u2028\nLike, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re running a blender or an air conditioner, I\u2019m just selling you electricity. [01:09:00] So my intention originally was, To just, I, you know, here\u2019s this thing, it generates screenshots and then build all these little apps in front of it, or you can build your own. Um, and I just charge for screen, you know, per screenshot. \u2028\nUm, \u2028\ntrying to think of, I mean, so it\u2019s like you look at, um, awesome motives. Optin Monster comes to mind. You know, they are a SaaS that technically works without the WordPress plugin, but it\u2019s really 99% designed to run with the WordPress plugin, um, for WordPress. And so you pay for a number of impressions or a number of campaigns or, I don\u2019t remember what, what it is, but it\u2019s something like that. \u2028\nSo I think we would definitely want to. We\u2019ll have to think about that, right? Because it\u2019s like the number of, if we [01:10:00] go with my model, it\u2019s very abstracted. Um, you know, it\u2019s per image generated, but you don\u2019t want somebody to sit there and go, oh, well, if I generate one more picture, you know, or if I tweak it and then regenerate and tweak it and regenerate, like, Ooh, did I spend it an eighth of a penny? \u2028\nLike, you don\u2019t want people worrying about that. So, um, you know, some, some general, but I, again, I, I control the, the water supply. Um, so we can do it in a way that. You know, you get, you get a thousand images or it\u2019s per post or per channels, or like, we can do something that makes a lot more sense for the end user or makes sense to the end user without being as technical as, you know, per image generated May, and maybe that is what we want. \u2028\nI don\u2019t know, but we can, we can kind of do what we want. Um, the, the downside is, I don\u2019t have a lot of information yet [01:11:00] about how much it actually costs, um, per, because I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve generated images for myself in a small quantity, you know, but at scale, I don\u2019t know yet.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: Well, could we, could we, and I think we should use Post Status, uh, for sure. \u2028\nYeah, that\u2019s wide open. There\u2019s no worries there. And I can, I\u2019ll give you a discount Post Status can pay for that, but I go, I. I want this on Post Status. Um, right. Then we go like, look what we did, we just overnight with one click essentially, um, created here, here\u2019s what I don\u2019t know from the technical side. \u2028\nSo like if we said just you create in there one time the open graph image. Okay. Go back for the entire site, it comes back. This is the default. That\u2019s one image. Right? Right now I don\u2019t know what the option for like [01:12:00] just that default business card image here. That\u2019s one image. Yep. The setting could be, um, you know, apply this one image across site. \u2028\nI. I mean, that\u2019s just saying programmatically in WordPress, that one image in your image library right now attaches No, the default open group across the database. Am I on track there?\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Correct. Because yeah, if we do it, um, so that the image comes back and you are hosting it, what do we care? So it, it, we have to pay for a few CPU cycles. \u2028\nThat\u2019s it.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: So there\u2019s that without getting pricing or whatever, but I just go that, yeah, I would, I want that today from post tennis. I want. Okay. Yeah. [01:13:00] Then we, we could say, we could use Post Status with, I don\u2019t know, thousands of articles, but, um, okay. Take most of these, a lot of these posts probably have a featured image in it on our site. \u2028\nYep. And then run that. I would pay the bill post us would pay the bill for that. Now create and just see what kind of thing we\u2019re looking sure at. You\u2019ve got a third here. I added though, is like, it\u2019s one thing to do the feature, just an open graph image, but that\u2019s not saying crop it for Twitter, Facebook. \u2028\nSo each post can have five different images. Right.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: And that\u2019s, and that\u2019s where it, it gets, I think it, it, it may get tricky for the end user to understand cuz also they\u2019re like, okay, I\u2019ve generated images. If I share my page, I see one of those images. But where it lives [01:14:00] somewhere in the media library. But you\u2019re also showing me these, these other thumbnails. \u2028\nOne\u2019s a square that says Instagram under it, but it\u2019s not on Instagram. Like, what, what do I do with this? You know? And so like, what, that might be a little tricky. Um, that\u2019s not what you\u2019re talking about, but that\u2019s, but to me that\u2019s, you know, that\u2019s the bigger product that we\u2019re talking about is like, I, I kind of like the phrase of like media kit generator, where it\u2019s like for each post create five different images and they, and download them as a zip. \u2028\nAnd so you get a zip file that, um, you know, or I mean, we can have a page click here to open your media kit for this post and you see all those images and there\u2019s a download button or again, a share out button or what have you. Um, but yeah, each, each post, that\u2019s, that\u2019s the thing right? Is um, As it\u2019s exponential. \u2028\nSo it\u2019s per post, or it\u2019s, or it\u2019s each [01:15:00] post. And then however many you want per post. And if, and if each post you wanna have, and this is, this is probably not a retroactive thing, um, but it\u2019s like I write a post today. I want Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. I want three different versions. Say they\u2019re three block quotes. \u2028\nSo Facebook times three, Twitter times three, Instagram times three, you know, same, same treatment, but block quote, block quote, block quote. And so I\u2019m like, okay, because I wanna schedule this to go to tweet today, tomorrow, and the next day. Like that\u2019s a proper marketing campaign around a post, a new post. \u2028\nBut that\u2019s nine social images. Plus open graph. So that\u2019s 10 per post. And that\u2019s where it starts to get exponential, you know? Um, not a bad thing. I mean, and these aren\u2019t expensive cuz [01:16:00] we\u2019re, we\u2019re using, you know, cloud computing as you\u2019d expect. But that\u2019s where it\u2019s, it might get complicated. Like we need to think about like per channel or per variation, or maybe it just is per image generated per post, or maybe it\u2019s just per, it is per, you know, it\u2019s like okay, every, every post is, you know, uh, 10 cents and you get 10 images per post. \u2028\nCuz I, I, I can\u2019t imagine that we\u2019re paying a penny per image at the end of the day. Especially if we push it all back to their media library. We\u2019re not hosting it, so it doesn\u2019t, it shouldn\u2019t cost us anything to ho you know, to ongoing disk space. At some point, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll delete old images that aren\u2019t getting used or something, but, you know, we say, But how, how you bill for 10 cents. \u2028\nCuz also there\u2019s this, like, one of the things that I wanted to do when I created Screenshot Express initially, I just, I like the [01:17:00] idea, you know, as we\u2019ve talked about in, um, previous sessions, we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t need this. And so we don\u2019t need, you know, this is, this is fun for us, this is a pursuit for us, but it\u2019s not, you know, do or die. \u2028\nAnd so it\u2019s like, I want to, I want to take every opportunity to like play with conventions. And so part of the thing that, you know, always bugs me about various services, there\u2019s is there\u2019s Ford developers, there\u2019s the pay per cycle, pay per whatever. Um, And then there\u2019s the other ones that are like, you pay a hundred dollars and you get a hundred things, and if you then need 101, we mark, we bump you up to the next payment tier. \u2028\nUm, and that bothers me because it\u2019s like, well, I, what if I only use 80, then I just gave you money, or the price per thing went up. Um, but the inverse, especially for a lot of non-technical people or in a lot of non-business [01:18:00] thinking people is like, gulp, I don\u2019t want to pay a dollar per thing because what if somebody hacks my site and uses us out a thousand things that just cost me a thousand dollars. \u2028\nUm, and so somewhere in the middle is this like, you know, pay for blocks or, um, you know, like there\u2019s some friendly way to Yeah. Um, have variable pricing without it, with, you know, with sanity checks or something like that. So I. And I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I\u2019m way overthinking it. The truth is, is we\u2019re gonna end up just charging $99, you know, for a thousand images per, per month. \u2028\nAnd, and we can, we can kind of gauge that when we set it up, we\u2019re like, oh, it looks like you have a thousand blog posts, and so we\u2019re gonna put you in the thousand dollars tier or whatever, you know, whatever. It\u2019s,\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: um, so it, it, it, it occurs to me for a second just to tuck this through because [01:19:00] No, that\u2019s, you\u2019re not overthinking that. \u2028\nI think you\u2019re making sure if you play this out, what that looks like and there\u2019s some decisions to be made, which are good. I think so. But like, okay. There\u2019s functionality probably, like I can go to Canva and create an open one, default open graph image. Now applying that across my site is functionality. \u2028\nI don\u2019t know if it exists. Or if it does, right?\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Like you\u2019d need something like, you\u2019d need something like Yost, but you are, you\u2019re, you\u2019re plugging in one image. Yeah. Maybe technically two. I think they give you Facebook and Twitter, \u2028\nbut that\u2019s definitely, that\u2019s the easy free onboarding for sure. Yeah. And then I, I honestly think that we, we build this, we run it against Post Status. We run it against my client\u2019s site. We look at the bills, and two things are gonna [01:20:00] happen. One, we\u2019re gonna know what our costs are, and two, we will have the experience of using it and go, oh, if, if I didn\u2019t know better, I would expect to pay for this, this way. \u2028\nAnd just, you know, and ju it\u2019ll just be like, oh, right, it should be 20 bucks. Month, build monthly.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: Now, as I, as I thought about that, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll have to go back to Yos, but I go the ability to take any image I have, whether OMG does this or not, but apply it across the site. And it\u2019s probably not one, it\u2019s three. \u2028\nLike we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s Google showing up, it\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, you know, so there\u2019s, there\u2019s four images to say or something. Now two and I, huh? \u2028\nCorey Maass: There really is only two cuz every, I\u2019m I, as far as I know, everybody [01:21:00] uses open graph image. Twitter\u2019s the only one that\u2019s broken away. Uh oh. Like I just Googled, you know, uh, LinkedIn open graph. \u2028\nAnd the article that comes up says, make your website shareable on LinkedIn. And it says below are the OG tags. And it\u2019s just, Facebook\u2019s OG tags. So LinkedIn just uses, use it, not just, but LinkedIn uses the same as Facebook.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: Okay. Then let me, here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. This could just, this functionality No, no. \u2028\nCreate an image, but just a plug in type functionality of see this image, apply it, cross the site to blogs, to everything on my site so that it\u2019s my reference sensation of my site. If it doesn\u2019t have other, other things that feels like that could be a [01:22:00] free, free option. A hundred percent. And that\u2019s valuable to, um, just going, yeah, I went to Camba, I got all my outputs, I wanna put \u2019em in and I just wanna say, apply that to my site so that instantly everything looks better if it\u2019s generic. \u2028\nOkay. But that\u2019s like probably a free option for us. Now where I go value though, is right here of I value all of my posts. Not having the generic, but having a minimal treatment. Generat an image for that post that has, if it has a featured image, put a featured image over here. Right. Something like that. \u2028\nSee, that\u2019s interesting to me. I think that\u2019s what we should play with and figure out that. Mm-hmm. Because I go, I want that today and if it costs me $500, I\u2019d do it. Hmm. If, if basic like, think about doing that [01:23:00] from cama, it\u2019s gonna take you a month. Oh yeah. Uploading, creating images, downloading and all this stuff. \u2028\nBut that\u2019s worth easily $500 for me today of any post on the site has this kind of image treatment with a click. And it\u2019s in the appropriate image graph now. Just told Google and my media library is under these pages or new images. I\u2019ve just updated my content. \u2028\nYep. Like now I\u2019m kind of thinking Corey, like that\u2019s some version of, this is actually B one that\u2019s free, but, but this could be, you know, a small, I\u2019m guessing small free plugin. Upload your image. It\u2019s applied generically through your site with some real simple, you know, business card template, but this, or use cam [01:24:00] and just put it up there. \u2028\nThis is powerful to me because I go every,\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: it\u2019s a huge time saver. That\u2019s the, yeah. Time and money, right is, yeah. Like you said, we\u2019re, we\u2019re, if you\u2019re auto generating, And especially if you\u2019re auto generating in bulk. Yeah. Okay, let\u2019s sign off. I\u2019ll go build it. Okay. I\u2019ll have it to you in 15 minutes. Just kidding. \u2028\nDo you have an auto generate button for that? Yeah, it\u2019s called chat. G p t.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: Uh, yeah. Hey, that\u2019s valuable. Um, what do I need to be thinking about for that? Because I\u2019m trying to put, I have the post that it\u2019s head on, but like, okay. What would I want is to be able to go through auto generate headline, an expert excerpt. \u2028\nIf it has a featured image, put it on there [01:25:00] for each post and be at in my media library attached to my post. \u2028\nI mean, that\u2019s, that\u2019s a lot of value. Am I missing something here? Like I go mm-hmm. Something with a button click. You could pretty much create new images packaged, um, in a way. And then telling Google in the net social networks, this now exists for this piece of content. \u2028\nI\u2019m having a hard time saying, why wouldn\u2019t I want that right now? Like I\u2019ve right for some money, I\u2019ve instantly updated and created new content for every post on my site. \u2028\nAnd there\u2019s. I know themes used the featured image, but we, we\u2019d wanna be careful replacing the featured image. But you go like, a lot of the themes have those, well, like the Frames blog have those little, well, you know, [01:26:00] a lot of sites don\u2019t even have that.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: The hero. Yep.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: The hero, the thumbnail, whatever that is. \u2028\nWhere it\u2019s like in the category archive, you\u2019ve instantly shown a nice basic modern design treatment with your colors and for everything.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Yep. Yeah. And it, I mean, and, and we\u2019d have a button that says, um, you know, swap for featured image. Like we\u2019ve taken your featured image, we\u2019ve put some text over it, you know, if you like this, make your featured image better. \u2028\nSo then it just one in, one out. We\u2019re not gonna delete your featured image cuz you could regenerate, want to regenerate the image again or something. But it would, yeah, like, so we\u2019ll give you that option. Like you probably don\u2019t want to do it by default. Um, but, so yeah, I, for now, let\u2019s, let\u2019s wrap up for today. \u2028\nCory Miller: Okay. Yeah. Sorry, I, we went over. \u2028\nCorey Maass: No, it\u2019s fine. [01:27:00] Um, you saw my note. I put a couple of things in Slack. \u2028\nSorry, I was in Never Neverland. I like it when you\u2019re in Never Neverland.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: Yes. We should get that. Um,\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: cool. Um, but I think, yeah, I think at this point, like I\u2019m pretty close to something that does something and, and let\u2019s have that something, that Alpha version run against. I mean, let\u2019s, let\u2019s get, create a Post Status staging or something. \u2028\nUm, but see what it, you know, Let\u2019s watch it run because there\u2019s other technical things. I wanna see, like we said, pricing. I wanna see how long it takes, you know, stuff like that. So let\u2019s, let\u2019s get into, let\u2019s, let\u2019s solve the problem for one and for 10 and for a hundred. And then, [01:28:00] you know, start to, and we\u2019ll continue to talk about the actual product and we\u2019ll just, and, you know, we\u2019re designing a really nice engine. \u2028\nLet\u2019s, we\u2019ll also talk about what the car looks like and then we can drop the engine in the car.\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: So there\u2019s 6,800 posts in, in Post says blog post only. Okay.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: That would be perfect. That\u2019s a great number. \u2028\nCory Miller: That would be \u2028\nokay. Okay, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll be thinking about what the card I wanted to look like, but I think it\u2019s title featured image, the standard branding.\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: Um, and yeah, and like I said, I mean, we\u2019re, we\u2019re, I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve already, I have, I couldn\u2019t show you, but I have two, you know, two very basic templates started. They are so easy to create. \u2028\nWe can, we can create 10, you know, in an hour. Just going, [01:29:00] oh, put this here, here, here. Cool. That\u2019s one. Put this here, here, here. Background image two, you know, cuz I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve, for better or worse, like, I went down the rabbit hole of abstracting a lot of this stuff out. So we can just say, I want a color, you know, I want background color, I want text color, I want, so it\u2019s just color, color, color, color. \u2028\nFont, font, font, font, on and on. So, We can, we can even sit down, like once we have one basic thing that we know is running, working, then you and I could, you know, have one of these calls where we just knock together 10 different templates. Okay?\u00a0 \u2028\nCory Miller: Okay. Thanks man. I lost track of time. Thanks for going\u00a0 \u2028\nCorey Maass: over. No, it\u2019s fine. \u2028\nUm, but yeah, so stay on for a minute. Okay. Session 11. End.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPost Tags:\t\t\n#Accessibility#ACF#Adobe#Agency#Agency Owners#Altis DXP#Apple#Automattic#B2B#Black Friday#Block Editor#Blocks#Blogging#Bob Dunn#Burnout#Chris Coyier#Clarity#Cloudways#CMS#community#Content#Cory Miller#CSS#CSS-Tricks#Customizer#Cyber Monday#Dan Knauss#Delicious Brains#Digital Ocean#Discussion#Documentation#DXP#Elementary#Email#Enterprise#Extension#Featured Image#Figma#Founders#Freelance#Freemius#Ghost#GitHub#GoDaddy#Gravity Forms#Gulp#Gutenberg#Headless#Health#Hiring#Hosting#HTML#huddles#Human Made#Iconic#Illustrator#Imposter Syndrome#Inclusion#Integrations#Interviews#JavaScript#Jeff Bezos#Jetpack#Jobs#JSON#LMS#Magento#maintenance#Marketing#Matt Cromwell#Matt Mullenweg#Membership#Mental Health#Migrate#Mobile#MOZ#Multisite#Nathan Ingram#New York Times#Newsletter#Nexcess#Ninja Forms#Page Builder#Pagely#Partnerships#Performance#Perspectives#PHP#Plugins#Pressable#Pricing#Professional Development#Publishing#React#SaaS#Scale#SEO#Shopify#Sketch#Social Networks#Square#Static#Substack#Testing#Themes#TikTok#tutorials#UX#WebP#WooCommerce#WordCamp#WordPress VIP#WordPress.org#WP Engine#WPEngine#www.youtube.com#Yoast \n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\nPrevious\nPreviousMember Spotlight: Matt LaueNextContinue\nTalking With Valet\u2019s Ceo Kimberly Lipari About The Changing Value Of Websites To Organizations-Post Status Draft\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar Posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHosting \n\nWeekend edition\nByBrian Krogsgard \nOctober 4, 2015 \n\n\n\nFriday was a bit slow so I figured I\u2019d wait for a weekend edition.
