The goal of this plugin is to test out and try the new features and get feedback from users. It is not meant to be used on a live site. This is for testing only.\nWhat is Available in the Beta Feature Plugin?\nBeta testing is a very important step toward a general release \u2013 because it gives you (the intended audience) the chance to add value to the final product. You help us validate the functionality, reliability, compatibility, and usability of the plugin. This plugin beta tests one specific feature we plan to release in GiveWP 3.0: The Visual Donation Form Builder.\nHowever, not all items or potential updates are supported in the beta! Here is what is available in the Beta Feature Plugin:\n\nForm goals\nCustom sections/fields\nForm Amount settings (e.g. Donor\u2019s choice vs Set donations)\nRecurring\nPayPal Standard\nNew Stripe gateway\nDonation limits (min/max)\n\nOf the things on this list, you will not want to miss the new Stripe Gateway. The new gateway effectively replaces every other Stripe gateway and introduces new payment methods such as bank transactions (ACH).\nThis isn\u2019t everything we have planned for GiveWP 3.0 \u2013 it\u2019s just what you can try right now (in a safe testing environment).\nWhat isn\u2019t Available in the Beta Feature Plugin?\nWhile the following updates won\u2019t be available in the Visual Donation Form Builder Beta Plugin, they (should) be available when Give3.0 is released to a general audience:\n\nFee Recovery\nForm Field Manager (including conditional fields)\nTributes\nGoogle Analytics\nPer Form Gateways\nLogin & Registration on Forms\nConsent Field (Terms & Conditions)\nPer Form Email Notifications\nForm Grid\nAuthorize.Net Gateway\n\nWhile we have every intention of including these items when we release GiveWP 3.0, not everything will be ready at once. Those that are not will be available soon. The good news is that until that time, your legacy GiveWP forms (forms created prior to 3.0) will continue to work as intended.\nWhat Items Will be Deprecated in 3.0?\nSometimes we realize that some of the features or add-ons we currently support need to be deprecated. Deprecation can occur for a number of reasons like it\u2019s been replaced by a better alternative or it\u2019s not being widely used.\nDeprecation simply means that we are ending official support but the items will remain available. In 3.0, we will be deprecating PayPal Pro and currency formatting settings:\n\nCurrency formatting settings: Note that we\u2019re not deprecating setting the currency, but how currencies are formatted, in favor of automatic formatting based on the donor\u2019s location\nPayPal Pro: This add-on is severely limited in terms of country support, costs $25/mo, and is essentially deprecated by PayPal itself. The alternative, PayPal Donations, uses the PayPal Commerce API, is a future-proof solution, is available in more countries, and \u2013 aside from transaction fees \u2013 is free.\n\nBeta Feedback Instructions\nThe feature plugin comes with a direct line to the development team working on the 3.0 launch.\nThe first time you open the new Visual Donation Form builder, there\u2019s a pop-up in the bottom right corner of the screen linking to the Feedback Site where you can provide feedback on your specific experience with the new form-building interface.\nA few tips:\n\nDouble-check that your feedback relates to what is currently available in the Beta Feature Plugin (vs. what is to come down the road).\nLook for your issue among the existing feedback before submitting new feedback.\nLimit your feedback to one issue per post \u2013 that helps issues get noticed.\nVideo/screencasts and other visual feedback are welcomed.\n\nRemember, the entire point of launching a beta test is to gather feedback from you \u2013 the eventual user. Sending in feedback is critical to ensure that our product is in the best possible shape when it\u2019s released. You can make a big difference by sharing your feedback during our beta period.\n\n\u00a0\nWe want to know: How will this new Visual Form Builder help you reach your fundraising goals? How do you envision this impacting your workflows?\nHow to Access and Use the Beta Feature Plugin\nThis plugin will require GiveWP core and be available directly on our website. As we mentioned earlier, it is very important that you test the Feature Plugin in a staging environment, and not in a live environment.\nHere are the simple steps you\u2019ll take to play around with beta:\n\n\n\nInstall Next Gen on your own test environment using our .zip file. Or, spin up our InstaWP setup. Both are available on the \u201cNext Gen\u201d page of this site.\nClick the \u201cCreate a Form\u201d button in an activation banner -or- \u201cAdd Next Gen Form\u201d in the left-hand menu.\nHave fun!\nClick the feedback button and follow the instructions to provide feedback.\n\n\n\nVisit the Next Gen Page\nJoin the Journey\nIf you\u2019ve gotten this far and you don\u2019t want to test the Visual Donation Form Builder but you want to know when it is ready, sign up to join the journey. We\u2019ll let you know when GiveWP 3.0 is ready for prime time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Our Journey \n\n\n\n\nHelp shape the next generation of WordPress donation forms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJason Adams \n\n\nJason Adams is the Manager of Development at GiveWP, where he leads the engineering team on planning and executing the future of the GiveWP plugin and add-ons.
