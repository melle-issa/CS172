Even though many of the best players celebrate only three out of 10 victories, failing more than you succeed is something that is very hard to accept. For the majority of my softball career I have struggled with this, but Cal State Fullerton gave me a new lens.\nTitan Softball recently had the opportunity to work with a sports psychologist, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned skills to help me on and off the field. Having a focal point like my bat keeps me grounded whenever I am stressed or doing too much. When I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not on the field, I look at the sky or the ceiling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a student and an athlete, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also learned to have a plan. For softball, putting in the extra practice before a weekend game is vital to feeling confident for the opponent I am going to face. With school, mapping out all of my assignments helps me feel prepared to do my best.\nBeing on the Titan Softball team is a great honor for me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the first one in my family to get a scholarship to play a sport at a Division 1 university. After I graduate, I hope to further my career in softball, become a coach and continue to grow the sport.Share Daisy's StoryAbout the GiftTitan Softball received a $40,000 matched gift from Mike Horn, professor emeritus of biological science, to connect students with a sports psychologist to help them improve their mental stamina and game day performance.
