The Code is a vital resource for all faculty and staff throughout USC, including those at Keck Medicine at USC and the Keck School of Medicine. Links to relevant policies, additional resources, and helpful tools are embedded in the digital document.\nUniversity Policies\nUSC\u2019s policies* have been established to create a safe and productive academic and work environment. All university employees and students are expected to be familiar with these policies and to follow them.\n* Any violations of the university\u2019s policies and/or codes of ethics or conduct will be thoroughly investigated upon reporting. Investigations of complaints are centralized and monitored through the Office of Professionalism and Ethics, available at report.usc.edu.\n\nUniversity Bylaws\nThe bylaws of the University of Southern California outline the university\u2019s governance structure and duties of the university\u2019s Board of Trustees.\n\nStrategic Plan\nSince 1994, USC\u2019s growth has been guided by a series of strategic plans. At the time it was developed, each new plan outlined a vision of the university\u2019s future and became a focal point for conversations involving the entire Trojan Family. Today, USC\u2019s previous strategic plans help provide continuity with the past while inspiring future innovation.\nUSC 2018 Strategic Plan: Answering the Call\nUSC 2011 Strategic Vision: Matching Deeds to Ambition\nUSC 2004 Strategic Plan\nFour-Year Report on the USC 1994 Strategic Plan\nUSC 1994 Strategic Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSC Communications / Notice of Non-Discrimination / Privacy Notice \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
