Now\u00a0they are\u00a0formally recognized as the Federated Indians of Graton\u00a0Rancheria and\u00a0chaired by Greg Sarris, who also holds the Graton Rancheria Endowed Chair at SSU.\nSonoma\u00a0State acknowledges in gratitude the Rancheria\u2019s ancestors for their stewardship of the land and all of its resources, and thank the current membership for their partnership in a number of educational initiatives, including the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria Learning Center at the Fairfield Osborn Preserve, located on Sonoma Mountain.\nAs Professor Sarris writes in his 2017 book How A Mountain Was Made, \u201cIt is said that Coyote was sitting atop Sonoma Mountain when he decided to create the world and people\u2014but that is part of the big story of the Mountain...\" We are now all part of the big story of the Mountain, and our stewardship of its resources, including our county and our university,\u00a0is an ongoing, vital responsibility we recognize and gladly accept.\u00a0Learn more about our Native American Initiative\u00a0at Sonoma State University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Holocaust & Genocide Memorial Grove  \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe Grove,> situated on the Sonoma State campus lake, was established to remember and honor those who endured, and continue to endure, global acts of genocide. Punctuated by a sculpture designed by Associate Professor of Sculpture Jann Nunn, this contemplative space also features a sapling from the original horse chestnut tree that stood outside the Secret Annex of the Anne Frank house in Germany, where she hid from the Nazis for more than two years and composed her famous diary. Sonoma State\u2019s sapling \u2013 one of only 11 granted by the Anne Frank Center \u2013 was planted in the Grove in 2013, in acknowledgment of our dedication to the values of equity, tolerance, civil rights, and social justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    The Seawolf Commitment  \n\n\n\nSonoma State University is committed to creating a community in which bias and intolerance have no place. It is our expectation\u00a0that\u00a0all students, faculty, and staff work together to honor this commitment and hold each other accountable to\u00a0create an open and inclusive environment.\u00a0Learn more about the Seawolf Commitment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Quick Links   \n\n\nAmerican Multicultural Studies \nChicano and Latino Studies\nNative American Studies\nCivility and Tolerance Statement \nInclusive Excellence: School of Business & Economics\nMcNair Scholars Program\nPrevention of Harassment and Discrimination \nParenting Rights and Resources \nWomen's and Gender Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of the President: Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\n\n\n\n1801 E.
