Are there good treatments for the virus now? Can I get natural immunity from an infection?\nThose questions were among the topics discussed at Chapman University\u2019s most recent Ask the Experts Virtual Town Hall, a series launched in the early days of the pandemic to bring scientists together to talk with the public about the crisis. The town halls have expanded to include other timely topics, but COVID-19 continues to be a focus.\nThe following are edited excerpts from the Ask the Experts Virtual Town Hall \u201cVaccine Hesitancy,\u201d held on Thursday, Sept. 17. Panelists included Jennifer Totonchy, Ph.D., assistant professor, School of Pharmacy; Gary Fong, PharmD., assistant professor, School of Pharmacy; Michael Shermer, Ph.D., Presidential Fellow; and Jeff Goad, PharmD., MPH., professor, School of Pharmacy.\u00a0\nWill I need a COVID-19 booster even though I\u2019m not 65 or at high risk for complications?\nEventually, yes, was the consensus among the research scientists and public health experts. Totonchy explains why.\n\u201cOur immune system needs to see that spike protein several times before that response is really, really powerful. This is just how the immune system works. It provides more resources in recognizing and remembering things it has seen multiple times. We\u2019re figuring out as we go how many doses it\u2019s going to take to get robust immunity, but it\u2019s not going to be yearly like influenza vaccines. Flu vaccines are not boosters; they\u2019re a new vaccine every year because flu is different every year. The virus that causes COVID-19 is not like the flu in that way. It doesn\u2019t mutate as fast and it doesn\u2019t have as many tricks up its sleeve. So most likely we\u2019re looking at a three-dose, maybe four-dose maximum, and then everyone will have really durable and long-lasting immunity.\u201d\nCan\u2019t we just treat COVID-19, rather than vaccinate?\nFong: \u201cWhen you get to hospitalization, we have a handful of medications we can use. The impact of these medications on your outcome as a hospitalized patient pales in comparison to what the vaccine does. For Remdesivir, for example, the data tells us that it probably increases the speed of your recovery, but it has little if any impact on decreasing your chances of dying from COVID-19. Dexamethasone is one we\u2019ve used for a while, which decreases your chance of dying, but again maybe a drop of from 40% to 30% in the sickest patients. Whereas vaccines drop it much, much more. So, we have some therapeutics that are available now, but they definitely are nowhere near what a vaccine can do. And all of these drugs are going to have side effects that are going to occur at a higher rate than any with the vaccine.\u201d\nCan I get natural immunity from a COVID-19 infection?\nTotonchy: \u201cOne natural infection is going to be like one vaccination, and it will most likely wane. And remember, this virus really mucks around with the immune system while it\u2019s in there, and during that process it\u2019s actually making the response sub-optimal, whereas a vaccine is designed to create a very specific response and isn\u2019t actively inhibiting or misdirecting the response like the virus is.\u201d\nFong: \u201cWe have patients, as many of you have heard of, who are long-haulers, who get COVID and have to deal with symptoms, some mild, some debilitating, for months on end. You probably do have some immunity from an infection, but you\u2019re stuck with the gamble you took.\u201d\nWhy can\u2019t people be free to choose to not get the vaccine? Why do we need mandates?\nShermer: \u201cPeople have a misunderstanding of what freedom means. You\u2019ll often hear people say, \u2018I should be free to decide whether or not to be vaccinated.\u2019 Well, OK, should you be free to decide to drive on the other side of the road? The biggest obstacle is this misperception of what it means to be free. That\u2019s not what freedom means. Not in a civil society.\u201d\nFong: \u201cThe number of people you can help, besides yourself, by getting vaccinated is probably greater than you think. It\u2019s the people around you, your family and loved ones. But it\u2019s also the health care workers and people who work in other [essential services] to consider. The hospitals have been at this for 20 months now. It\u2019s been tough. Health care workers are exhausted. We just get a break and then we get another surge. We have something that is so readily available in these vaccines that can really squash this, and it\u2019s so frustrating to see that we aren\u2019t able to just do this as a collective group. So think about those who you can help by getting vaccinated.\u201d\nCan I get a flu shot and the COVID-19 vaccine?\nGoad: \u201cYes, absolutely! One arm for COVID, the other arm for influenza, and your body can handle that just fine. Flu hasn\u2019t gone away. When everybody stays indoors, wears masks and stays away from each other, it goes down, but it will come back. Don\u2019t put off flu vaccination.\u201d\n\nExpert Biographies\nJeff Goad, PharmD., MPH., Professor, School of Pharmacy\nJeff Goad is the Associate dean of Academic Affairs and professor and chair in the Department of Pharmacy Practice at the School of Pharmacy.
