Maybe we could add a generic filter that allows changing InnerBlocks properties? cc: @gziolo\nFor the specific case in question, a possible workaround is to define the newly created block as a child block of the media & text block, child blocks are allowed even if the allowedBlocks setting does not include them. cc: @edirpedro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ud83d\udc4d\n2\n chrisvanpatten and braican reacted with thumbs up emoji\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4d\n2 reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njorgefilipecosta\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nNov 18, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n      Option to extend blocks, remove parts of their UI, and/or update its behaviour in some cases.\n      #7931\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Closed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmikejolley\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nJun 4, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n      [Atomic Block] Support for Columns/Column\n      woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks#2526\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Closed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmmtr\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nJun 9, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n      Add premium content button block for login and subscribe buttons\n      Automattic/wp-calypso#42715\n \n\n\n Merged\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\n\n\n\nmmtr\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Jun 9, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe we could add a generic filter that allows changing InnerBlocks properties?\n\nI wonder if we could be even more flexible and add some filter to canInsertBlockTypeUnmemoized, so the allowed blocks can be determined fully dynamically.\nThere might be some cases where a block can be inserted depending on the current editor state. For instance, in Automattic/wp-calypso#41850 we're interested in making a custom button block insertable as a inner block of core/buttons, but only on core/buttons blocks that are descendant of a particular custom container block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ud83d\udc4d\n2\n Bysander and leclaeli reacted with thumbs up emoji\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4d\n2 reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyouknowriad\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nAug 18, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n      Allow / Dissalow nested sub-blocks\n      #24596\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngkaragia\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nApr 7, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n      Allow users to group button blocks in course page\n      Automattic/sensei#4160\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntalldan\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nJun 10, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n      InnerBlocks' allowedBlockswhitelist not respected due to parent field of another block's block.json.\n      #32436\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Closed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskorasaurus\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nDec 2, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n      InnerBlocks allowedBlocks does not remove non-whitelisted blocks\n      #46281\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Closed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngziolo\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nApr 18, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n      Group: Add allowedBlocks attribute and pass it to innerBlockProps\n      #49128\n \n\n\n Merged\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngziolo\n\n\n\n\n        added\n  the \n\n  [Feature] Block API\n\nAPI that allows to express the block paradigm.\n label\n\n\n    Apr 18, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMember\n\n\n\n\n\ngziolo\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 18, 2023\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n          edited\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am noting that there is an open PR #49128 that proposes adding allowedBlocks attribute and passing it to innerBlockProps for the Group block.

The media and text block is a very common use case for this in my projects - we often only want the client to insert \"text blocks\" (paragraph, heading, button, list) and not embeds or \"layout\" blocks. Providing this option on a per-instance basis to blocks is great. Some core blocks already allow this, but not all. So combining these efforts would be great.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMember\n\n\n\n\n\ngziolo\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 20, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeally, the information about the allowed inner blocks would be stored in attributes in some type of the metadata attribute that holds all the details about the block related to its configuration in the editor, which isn\u2019t concerned with the content or design. The prior art is the lock attribute which is one of the top-level global attributes (see). Still, that approach might not scale well as we need to ensure that the every new attribute name added for metadata doesn\u2019t conflict with what existing attributes that blocks use. In addition to that, every new top-level attribute like that would require changes in the WP_Block_Type class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\n\n\n\ngaambo\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 20, 2023\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n          edited\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeally, the information about the allowed inner blocks would be stored in attributes in some type of the metadata attribute that holds all the details about the block related to its configuration in the editor, which isn\u2019t concerned with the content or design.\n\nI agree with you. I think a lot of \"settings\" attributes which are not content-/design-related but more settings for the editor-ui of this specific block instance could be bundled into this. I think there were some discussions about this in some issues/PRs regarding container-block system. I can only find those atm: #41547 #39281 #40318\nNot all blocks which have inner blocks will be sections (think: core/list block), but having a general way of storing these per-instance settings may be applicable to this use case as well.\nAlso related: #48112\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ud83d\udc4d\n1\n gziolo reacted with thumbs up emoji\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4d\n1 reaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMember\n\n\n\n\n\nMamaduka\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 20, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI agree with @gziolo. Eventually, we want to move all attributes that serve as per-block settings in the editor into meta or internal attributes.\nWe can consider a more general solution once the meta/internal attributes API lands into the core.\n@mmtr, I believe you're describing a different issue tracked in #14515.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ud83d\udc4d\n2\n mmtr and gziolo reacted with thumbs up emoji\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4d\n2 reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\n\n\n\ngaambo\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 20, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor what it's worth: I would still like to add this property to the media & text block, since some other core blocks (cover, group) already provide that option. When a general api for meta/internal attributes is implemented they have to be migrated anyway. Just like #49128 for the group block. I can create a PR if that's an option for you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ud83d\udc4d\n1\n gziolo reacted with thumbs up emoji\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udc4d\n1 reaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMember\n\n\n\n\n\nMamaduka\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 20, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSounds good, @gaambo.
