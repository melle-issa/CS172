So it might look like I\u2019m doing a lot, but because I enjoy it, it doesn\u2019t feel like a lot.\u201d\nLotus Thai \u201917 in a \u201cput waste in its place\u201d costume.\nFrom fifth-grade biology to Chapman\nThai\u2019s interest in science started in childhood, and grew in fifth grade when a visiting microbiologist let her class \u201cswab anything and everything.\u201d That scientist later showed the students bacteria that grew from the swabs, she says.\nShe took Advanced Placement environmental science her junior year of high school, and her mother told her she \u201clit up\u201d whenever she spoke about it. Thai, whose parents both ran businesses, planned to major in business.\n\u201cScience was to me the fun stuff,\u201d she says.\nShe wanted to go to college in New York, but still applied to Chapman after her father, who often drove by the campus on his way to work and noticed its beauty, said she should fill out an application.\n\u201cWhat I also tell my students is that things work out \u2013 it might not be the path that you thought you were going to take. But everything works out and when you look back, you\u2019re like, my life could have been really different if I didn\u2019t go to Chapman,\u201d she says.\nThai, a first-generation college student, double majored in environmental policy and business administration. It was the overall Chapman experience that helped prepare her for her career \u2013 \u201csoft skills that you don\u2019t learn in a traditional classroom,\u201d she says.\nHer Chapman experience included working in the Student Engagement office, advising faculty through Schmid College of Science and Technology\u2019s Student Leadership Council and planning events through the University Program Board.\nFrom Chapman to Disneyland\nStarting her first year, she participated in what she calls the most intense experience of her adulthood \u2013 Solar Decathlon. The collegiate competition organized by the U.S. Department of Energy challenges teams to build a house to \u201cdemonstrate creative solutions for real-world issues in the building industry.\u201d\n\u201cIt really threw me in the deep end \u2013 I had to use time management, project management, collaborate with people who don\u2019t think the same way,\u201d says Thai, who was part of a team of Orange County students. \u201cIt really gave me a crash course in what the real world is like.\u201d\u00a0\nThai also interned during college for Orange County Coastkeeper and ECOS.\nECOS \u2013 led by Kelly Vlahakis-Hanks (MBA \u201916) \u2013 was Thai\u2019s first experience with corporate sustainability.\n\u201cThat was when I was like, \u2018I could do something like this for the rest of my life,\u2019\u201d she says.\nSince she began working at Disneyland Resort, Thai says she has learned a lot, including that sustainability is more complex than people think.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as, \u2018We\u2019re going to have reusables in every single restaurant,\u2019\u201d she says.\nFor example, a restaurant in Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge had a reusable spork. Because the utensil \u201clooked so cool, everyone kept taking it,\u201d Thai says.\n\u201cWe care about sustainability and we want to reduce waste but at the same time, how many sporks can we keep replacing?\u201d\nImagination and collaboration\nOnce Disney reaches its 2030 sustainability goals \u2013 net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, zero waste to landfills, water conservation, low-impact products and sustainable buildings\u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone out there who can say that they can\u2019t do it,\u201d she says.\nThai\u2019s work towards zero waste at Disneyland Resort involves both infrastructure and psychology.\n\u201cI can put the right kind of landfill can, mixed recycling can and food can out there. But how do I get guests and cast members to actually use it correctly?\u201d she says.\nOne of her ideas was surprising guests with a collectible pin if they sorted their waste correctly in Tomorrowland.\n\u201cWe\u2019re harnessing the Disney brand and rewarding people for doing the right thing,\u201d she says.\nIn addition to her day job, Thai shares with Chapman students everything she\u2019s learned working in corporate sustainability.\n\u201cI just knew that I always liked teaching,\u201d says Thai, who was a substitute teacher for a little while after graduating. \u201cI think it goes back to the teachers that I had growing up but also the teachers at Chapman \u2013 they did so much for me.\u201d\nOne key thing she\u2019s learned in the sustainability field is that different departments must work together.\n\u201cIf the students can do that, when they go out into the workforce and they apply that type of thinking, it helps build credibility because they\u2019re able to put themselves into someone else\u2019s shoes and help that other person solve their challenges,\u201d she says.\nStudents who want to work in sustainability should do something they like within that area, she says.\n\u201cIf you really like graphic design, a lot of the time I\u2019m trying to figure out how to design a mixed recycling trash can. A graphic designer would be perfect for that,\u201d she says. \u201cSustainability is that unique field where you can grab two things and combine them.\u201d\nA student who ventures into that world just might end up at the Happiest Place on Earth.\n\n\nDisney Disneyland Disneyland Resort environmental science and policy environmental science and policy program Schmid College of Science and Technology sustainability \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJoy Juedes \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCUSP Rakes in the Accolades\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle Longley Named the Executive Director of the Society of Military History\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Awarded $2.2 Million in Federal Funding for Drought and Environmental Research \n\nApril 20, 2023 Rachel Morrison\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman University Appoints Athina Cuevas as Assistant Director of Promising Futures First-Generation Program and Cross-Cultural Center Chapman University\u2019s Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) named Athina Cuevas assistant director of the Promising Futures First-Generation Program and Cross-Cultural Center.
