We are often asked how we select the incoming class from such a large applicant pool.\nThere is no formula used. Each applicant is unique. Our applicants are evaluated by their individual accomplishments and the activities in which they have been involved.\nOur goal is to select a well-balanced, diverse class to which each student will contribute their talents and experiences to classmates, professors and eventually their patients.\nExamples of factors we use in evaluating an applicant are:\n\nAcademics\nClinical exposure\nInvolvement in research\nCommunity service\nExtracurricular activities\nLife experiences\nPersonal qualities\nCommunication skills\nLeadership\nTeamwork\n\nEach first-year class includes:\n\nSix students in the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP, MD/PhD). Each receives a Ph.D. in addition to a medical degree.\nTwelve students in the Program in Medical Education for the Latino Community (PRIME-LC). PRIME-LC students earn a master's degree as well as a medical degree and they are trained to become healthcare leaders in underserved Latino communities.\nTwelve students to the Leadership Education to Advance Diversity: African, Black, Caribbean.\n\nPlease refer to the pages on this website to learn more about our admissions process.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0Licensure and Certification Disclosures - Notice to Students Re: Professional Licensure and Certification\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of California, Irvine \u2022 Irvine, CA 92697 Contact\u00a0Us | Comments & Questions | Privacy & Legal Notice | Copyright Inquiries | \u00a9\n\nUC Regents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
