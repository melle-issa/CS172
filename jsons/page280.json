The memoir consists of a collection of essays, with topics ranging from alcoholism, poverty, fashion, queer culture in the 90s, and sex. As is mentioned in Kazim Ali\u2019s essay \u201cGenre-Queer: Notes Against Generic Binaries,\u201d people are looking to break down the expectations that might be imposed on a body of work just as they would be on a person. Tea adds her own color to this discussion with her genre-bending novel Black Wave, blending elements of a memoir into a fictional universe, and with the novel-turned-film, Valencia, which became a collaborative effort with 21 different directors whose unique vision led to a sold-out premiere at the Castro Theater in San Francisco.\nIn the first chapter of How to Grow Up, Tea identifies herself with a persimmon tree due to its unsynchronized flare of life:\u201cAs all the other trees lose their leaves and begin their winter dying, the persimmon flares up brighter than any of them have ever been, bearing fruit, even. That was me. I wasn\u2019t on the same timetable as the other trees in the garden, but I was alive, coming into a certain prime, even.\u201d\nTea associates this image of the persimmon\u2019s belated blooming with a positive note that is sustained throughout the memoir. Although she often approaches her past self with humility and insight, she never apologizes for being different and even dedicates a chapter to \u201cYoung Michelle.\u201d In this chapter, she simultaneously ridicules and adores Young Michelle (velvet body suit and all), but never placed her in a box. This strain of self-love, almost edging on maternal, resonated with me and came off as deeply unique. Having been raised working class in Chelsea, Massachusetts, she is able to contextualize her actions in a way that brings her readers together, despite the sometimes obscure events in her life, such as living in a house where none of the roommates cleaned. Ever. Seeing that I am the type of person who saves old toothbrushes in order to scrub the grout lines along the tile floor, I was horrified.\nThis image of the persimmon tree is subtly repeated when her sobriety acts as a conduit for moving in with partying twenty-year-olds and again when her \u201cbiological time clock\u201d begins tolling with the desire to experience pregnancy. These situations play at readers\u2019 expectations of recovery and of their own understanding of when milestones should occur.\nMichelle Tea is a memoirist, poet, editor, founder of the online publication Mutha magazine and the non-profit organization RADAR Productions, and a literary citizen, having dedicated a portion of her career to creating opportunities for queer writers, such as Sister Spit. She has also written for multiple blogs and magazine, including xojane, where she documented her experiences with pregnancy. A particular favorite of mine was called, \u201cGetting Pregnant With Michelle: I had a Baby.\u201d\nButte College, Butte College\u2019s Diversity Committee and the 1078 Literary Committee are proud to welcome Michelle Tea to the 1078 Gallery (820 Broadway) on October 11th, 7:30 pm.\nWritten by Samantha Smith\n\n \n\nOctober 10, 2016watershedcsuc 1078 gallery, Butte College, diversity, michelle tea\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll\n\nDiscuss\nGet Inspired\nGet Polling\nGet Support\nLearn WordPress.com\nTheme Showcase\nWordPress Planet\nWordPress.com News\n\n\nTopics\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nUpcoming Events No upcoming events\nArchives\n\nMay 2022\nMarch 2022\nMay 2020\nOctober 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nOctober 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nApril 2017\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nDecember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nApril 2014\nFebruary 2014\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nAugust 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\n\n \n\nFollow me on TwitterMy Tweets \n\n\n\n\nCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
