The Neighborhood S Community Council \u2013 made up of students representing each house in the neighborhood, Resident Fellows, and professional staff \u2013 worked together to plan the event. Student representatives knew the Stanford undergraduate community was filled with students looking for opportunities to express their creativity and talent, and showcase the things they care about, and suggested the idea of a festival to highlight student art and performance. The council reached out to the undergraduate community, student makers from the ASSU Student Business Directory and previous campus events, and outside vendors who had been a hit in the past, and was thrilled when so many creatives, performers, small business owners, and wellness groups were able to join food vendors for a great event. Check out the highlights.\n\n\n\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nStudent musician Charlie Kogen performs at Neighborhood S Sunset Fest at Wilbur Field.\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nStanford Jump Rope performs at Neighborhood S Sunset Fest at Wilbur Field.\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nStudent group Never Comin\u2019 Back performs Neighborhood S Sunset Fest at Wilbur Field.\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nStudent group Never Comin\u2019 Back performs Neighbhorhood S Sunset Fest at Wilbur Field.\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nStudent musician Tamish performs at Neighborhood S Sunset Fest at Wilbur Field.\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\nStudent musician Violet Venners performs at Neighborhood S Sunset Fest at Wilbur Field.\nImage credit: Nikolas Liepins/Ethography\n\n\n Fullscreen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Life\nVice Provost For Student Affairs\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to read next:\n\n\n\n\n \nAcademic Council\nReport of the president: Academic Council Professoriate appointments\nThe following Academic Council Professoriate appointments, promotions, and reappointments for the periods indicated were reviewed by the Advisory Board of the Academic Council on Jan. 17, Jan. 31, Feb. 7, Feb. 21, Feb. 28, and March 7, 2023, and were approved by the president.
