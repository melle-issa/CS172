This year\u2019s honorees were inducted at the annual Night of Champions on October 14, and a plaque was unveiled along Gray Victory Way at halftime during Saturday\u2019s football game.\u00a0\n\nJillian Felger-Mabee \u201909\nVolleyball\nThree-Time All-American Selection\nAcademic All-American\nCareer Record Holder for Hitting Percentage\nOn Induction: \u201cI teared up. My years playing at Chapman mean so much to me. The proud feeling when I attended Linda Ly Zaragoza\u2019s induction (2017) was something I hoped I could feel for myself.\u201d\nI\u2019ll Never Forget: \u201cBeating Claremont-Mudd-Scripps in five games during my junior year. We lost the first game by a huge deficit, won the next two, and the final two games went beyond the normal game point. I\u2019ll never forget how we came together as a team\u2026 and the celebration after we won.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBuddy Klovstad \u201906\nBaseball\nTwo-Time All-American Selection\nTwo-Time All-Region Selection\nTop-10 All-Time Ffor Wins, Innings Pitched,\u00a0Era, Strikeouts and Games Started\nOn Induction: \u201cIt means a lot to me, my wife, my kids and the rest of my family. I grew up in the City of Orange. To be able to attend Chapman University and play baseball in front of my family and local community was a great opportunity for me. I know by the outpouring of messages that this also means a lot to former Panthers, many of whom will join me in the HOF in the coming years.\u00a0\nI\u2019ll Never Forget: \u201cThe times I was able to just step off the mound in the later innings of games and just look around and soak it all in.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLauren Kamiyama \u201909\nBasketball\nAll-Region Selection\nCareer Record Holder\u00a0for Assists And Steals\nTop-3 All-Time for Made Three-Pointers\nOn Induction: \u201cI\u2019m so honored. This is a prestigious group of Panthers I\u2019m joining, and I would have never imagined I would be inducted into the Chapman Hall of Fame.\u201d\nI\u2019ll Never Forget: \u201cOur playoff game against LaVerne. We were down about 20 points with something like 5 or 6 minutes left. Coach Jue believed a game was never over until the final buzzer. This game was the epitome of that as we managed to tie it to force overtime, then\u00a0take control in overtime. It was such an emotional win. I couldn\u2019t even process what just happened.\u201d\nMaggie Wilder Werner \u201907 (Ma \u201912)\nSoftball\nTwo-Time All-American Selection\nThree-Time All-Region Selection\nTop-5 All-Time for Career Wins,\u00a0Strikeouts, Era and Shutouts\nOn Induction: \u201cHonored is an understatement. My daughters getting to watch their mom be inducted into Chapman\u2019s Hall of Fame is a priceless gift the university has bestowed on me.\u201d\nI\u2019ll Never Forget: \u201cBoth Regionals and Nationals are big standouts. Our team was pure magic in those tournaments. But the friendships with my teammates are my fondest memories. Long after our playing days, we\u2019ve been there for each other through weddings, babies and funerals. Lifelong friendships came from my experience as a Chapman softball player, and there\u2019s nothing more important than that.\u201d\n\n\n\nalumni news athletics Baseball basketball hall of fame night of champions sports Women's softball women's volleyball \n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Hockey Coach Sam Uisprapassorn \u201905 Leads Colombian National Team to Success, Shoots for NHL\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman University Administrators Carry the Banner Of Leadership\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurel Tamayo \u201921 Inspires Climate-Friendly Action Through Film Laurel Tamayo \u201921 was recently named one of Forbes\u2019 68 Climate Leaders Changing the Film and Television Industry Tamayo is an Impact Campaign Consultant at Rare Entertainment Lab, a behavior change organization that...\n\n\nApril 19, 2023 Staci Dumoski\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumna Implements Sustainability at Happiest Place on Earth A Chapman University alumna is helping Disneyland Resort meet its ambitious goal of sending zero waste to landfills by 2030.
