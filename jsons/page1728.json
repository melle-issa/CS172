In addition to being virtuoso performers with distinct artistic voices, they need to function as digital-savvy technicians and entrepreneurs. We equip artists with the portfolio of skills they need to thrive.\n\nFind Your Path\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways innovating, always collaborating.\nUSC Thornton students collaborate constantly across musical genres within the school, and with their peers in USC\u2019s world-class cinematic arts, dance, and theatre schools. We encourage study abroad, as musicians\u2019 multi-faceted careers increasingly are global. This international focus builds a multicultural sensibility and widens students\u2019 professional networks.\n\nFind Your Path\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpportunities abound.\nNo one career looks like another, and we train students for success in multiple career paths. These include stages, studios, higher education, K-12 classrooms, and arts leadership positions. Our location in Los Angeles, the creative capital of the world, provides a wealth of nearby opportunities.\n\nFind Your Path\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore our programs.\nOur three exceptional divisions offer cross-genre experiences, exposing students to diverse styles and techniques that will prepare them for a well-rounded career at the highest level.\n\nClassical Performance & Composition\nContemporary Music\nResearch & Scholarly Studies\n\n\n\n\n\nClassical Performance & Composition\n\nChamber Music\nChoral & Sacred Music\nClassical Guitar\nComposition\nKeyboard Collaborative Arts\nKeyboard Studies\nOrgan Studies\nStrings\nVocal Arts & Opera\nWinds & Percussion\n\n\n\nContemporary Music\n\nJazz Studies\nMusic Industry\nMusic Technology\nMusical Theatre\nPopular Music\nScreen Scoring\nStudio Guitar\n\n\n\nResearch and Scholarly Studies\n\nArts Leadership\nCommunity Engagement\nEarly Music Performance\nMusic Teaching & Learning\nMusicology\nPolish Music Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover USC Thornton\n\n\n\nSpotlightssee all Young Artist Project: Jamie KimIn the third of four profiles, meet a Thornton alum who is highlighting women and BIPOC composers for her Young Artist Project.Nicole McCabe\u2019s Award SeasonA surprise win for her jazz quintet in Amsterdam was the first of several career boosts for the saxophonist.First ChairPioneering violinist Eudice Shapiro, a longtime USC faculty member and the first female concertmaster of a studio orchestra, is remembered by her students.\n\nNewssee all April 27, 2023Jacobo Herrera and Jacob Vogel promote the marching arts in USC NewsApril 25, 2023Composition alumni nominated for 2023 ASCAP Composers\u2019 Choice AwardsApril 20, 2023NoSo receives multiple Libera Award nominationsApril 18, 2023Lyndia Johnson named honoree of USC Faculty and Staff Recognition Program by University Club\n\n\nUpcoming Eventssee all \n\n\n5/3\n\n\n\n\nWed | 7:30 PM |  Newman Recital Hall (AHF)\n\nStrings Concerto Competition\n\nStudent finalists perform concertos by 20th and 21st century composers before a panel of three distinguished external adjudicators.\n\n\n\n\nView All Events at Thornton Live\n\n\n\n\nTake a look back at some of the many highlights of an amazing fall semester at USC Thornton.\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSC Thornton School of Music\n\nAbout\nAcademics\nAdmission\nStudent Life\nEvents\nGive\nApply\nSearch\n \n\n\n Los Angeles, CA 90089-1441\nOffice: (213) 740-6935\nAdmission: (213) 740-8986\n\n\n\n\nAlumni\nContact\nHire a Musician\nPress\nSpotlights\nOperations\n \n\n\nSubscribe to USC Thorntonsign up\n\n\n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nInstagram\nYouTube\nLinkedIn\n \n\nNotice of Non-Discrimination\n\n\n\t\t\t\u2022\n\t\t\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\n\t\t\t\u2022\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t2021 University of Southern California\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
