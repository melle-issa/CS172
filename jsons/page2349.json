Because of this,\u00a0historically underserved populations have not had equal access or opportunity for educational success.Chico State has intentionally made equity, diversity, and inclusion the University\u2019s top\u00a0Strategic Plan\u00a0priority in order to challenge and change the status quo on our campus and in society.We commit toHonoring the distinct values, beliefs, identities, and cultures of our students, faculty, staff, and community.Providing the educational tools and resources for our students, faculty, and staff to understand, challenge, and change historical discrimination and oppression\u00a0through interdisciplinary and international experiences.Examining our own institutional practices to uncover and eliminate biases and barriers so that all Wildcats can be successful here.Moving beyond being an institution that welcomes diverse populations to one that serves and allows people to truly thrive.Portraits are on display for the Dear World photo exhibit in Kendall Hall.
