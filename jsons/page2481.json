Hass was guest lecturing in Ardell\u2019s class of student teachers, and the moment the discussion turned to student mental health issues, the stories started flowing.\nA high school student teacher told of a youngster who had just come out as gay to their family, and the family kicked them out of the house.\n\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d the teacher asked.\nA third-grade teacher offered background on a student who had an incarcerated parent, sharing that sometimes the student would bolt from the class right in the middle of a lesson.\n\u201cHow do I help him?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cAfter three hours of all these questions and all the stories about what they\u2019d seen, it was clear that we needed to give teachers a bit of a mental health primer,\u201d said Ardell, Ph.D., instructional assistant professor in the Attallah College of Educational Studies at Chapman University.\nNow that book is available. Hass and Ardell have co-authored \u201cSupporting Student Mental Health: Essentials for Teachers,\u201d a guide to the basics of identifying and supporting students with mental health challenges.\nThe class discussion that inspired their book is certainly not the only evidence of an acute need for advice and strategies to help teachers cope with what many educators are calling a crisis of mental health in the classroom.\nCDC Research Data \u2018Echo a Cry for Help.\u2019\nA report on high school students released in March by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows how the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic has made an already bad situation worse.\nThe data, collected in 2021, show that 44% of students surveyed felt persistently sad or hopeless during the past year, with more than 55% saying that they experienced emotional abuse by a parent or other adult in the home.\n\u201cThese data echo a cry for help,\u201d said CDC official Debra Houry, MD. \u201cOur research shows that surrounding youth with the proper support can reverse these trends and help our youth now and in the future.\u201d\nArdell and Hass hope their book will help get resources to those who now recognize the need to seek them out.\n\u201cNow the problem is inescapable, even for people who might not have paid attention to it before,\u201d said Hass, Ph.D., professor of scholarly practice in Attallah College as well as a school psychologist, licensed educational psychologist and clinical counselor.\nA Supportive Learning Environment Has widespread Benefits\nA big part of the authors\u2019 message is that when teachers set up a healthy classroom environment and \u201cdo other things they think are for academic purposes, those things are also good for mental health purposes,\u201d said Ardell, Ph.D., who has expertise in teacher education and is a former elementary school teacher.\nA supportive classroom culture fosters relationships that sustain people when they\u2019re struggling mentally and emotionally, the authors emphasized.\n\u201cThat supportive environment allows people to be vulnerable and to ask for help,\u201d Ardell said.\n\u201cRelationships are so fundamental to being human that they can literally make everything better or everything worse,\u201d Hass added. \u201cI always say to students in my counseling classes that students don\u2019t have to love you, they just have to trust you.\u201d\nWith that bond in place, teachers are better prepared to absorb sometimes startling revelations without immediately rushing the student up to the office.\n\u201cWe want [teachers to] have a supportive conversation and then use that as a bridge to connect the student to more specialized help,\u201d Hass said.\nRecognizing cases that require follow-up and referral is a huge part of the equation, the authors say. Not every student who is suffering externalizes that pain.\n\u201cThe child who has a tantrum or otherwise lashes out gets referred all the time,\u201d Hass said. \u201cBut kids who are depressed or who have significant anxiety often go unnoticed. Maybe they\u2019re not doing as well as they used to in class, but they\u2019re kind of holding it together. We want to help teachers pick up on those clues.\u201d\n\u2018A Healthy Teacher Means Healthy Kids\u2019\nIn their last chapter, the authors focus on self-care for teachers, which they are careful not to oversimplify. As Hass says, \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as, \u2018Go eat your vegetables and everything will be fine.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s using our own relationships to support and sustain us, because we know that a healthy teacher means healthy kids,\u201d Ardell said. \u201cThis year has been incredibly stressful on many of our colleagues in the field.\u201d\nThe wider community needs to ensure that teachers are feeling connected and valued in meaningful ways that go beyond cards and gifts during Teacher Appreciation Week, Ardell added.\n\u201cWe, as a society, need to commit to protecting educators\u2019 well being, and we need them to know that they don\u2019t have to wear four hats,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe want to help teachers make a smooth and intentional hand-off to a mental health professional, then go back to making sure their classroom is welcoming, culturally responsive and safe. Those are the things kids need most to support their mental health.\u201d\n\n\nfeatures research \n\n\n\n\n \n\nDennis Arp \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDodge College Animation Student Preserves Holocaust History\n\n\n\n\n\nAraceli Martinez Named Executive Director of Chapman\u2019s Cross-Cultural Center and First-Generation Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership That Spans the Campus Jack of all trades Kyle Tanimura is leaving quite the lasting mark on Chapman, where he has taken on multiple leadership roles as a double major in political science and strategic and corporate communication, with a...\n\n\nMay 1, 2023 Jennifer Winfield\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Pacific Islander Desi American Heritage Month Events at Chapman University Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Heritage Month, which runs from May 1 to 31, celebrates the identities, histories and experiences of the APIDA community.
