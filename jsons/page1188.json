Students who have a final on Friday of Finals Week are required to move out no later than 11:00 a.m. on May 20, 2023.

Charges are applied to student's accounts in July for the Fall semester and December for the Spring semester. Costs include the $300 Housing Down Payment paid when applying to live on campus.\u00a0\nBilling Statements & Making Payments\nStudent Billing Statements, known as \"eBills,\" are issued electronically at the beginning of the month. The eBills are emailed to your SSU Email address and a variety of payment options are accepted. Students will receive an email notification to their SSU email address each time an eBill is generated.\n\nThe semester charges can be paid in full or in 4 installments starting August 1 for the Fall term and January 1 for the Spring term.\u00a0 There are several different methods for making future housing payments.\u00a0 Please see the How to Make Payments website for more information. Failure to pay the amount on or before the due date will result in action by the University including, but not limited to, eviction, academic holds, payment due in full, and/or late fees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    On Campus Rates  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    2023-2024 Rates and Installment  \n\n\nBecause housing rates vary based on room type, it is important for all students interested in living on campus to be aware of the applicable costs. This section of the website is designed to be helpful for both students and their families/supporters when it comes to paying for on-campus housing.\nIncluded in the total cost is the $300 initial payment, which must be submitted when applying to live on campus. The $300 initial payment is deducted from the total amount due toward your first semester and is not a deposit.\nRATES\nPlease click the link below that best corresponds to you:\nIncoming First Year First Time Freshmen Housing Rates 2023-2024\nIncoming Transfer Housing Rates 2023-2024\nRising Sophomore & Upper Division Continuing SSU Students 2023-2024\nGraduate Student Housing Rates 2023-2024\nSeawolf All Inclusive Housing Rates\u00a0\n\t\nStudents who applied for 2021/2022 housing by May 7, 2021, and continue to live on campus for consecutive semesters were eligible to lock in the 2021/2022 year rates.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    2022-2023 Rates and Installment  \n\n\nHousing rates vary based on room type.

Dining Dollars can be used at any dining location on campus. When making a food purchase, simply present your Seawolf ID Card to the cashier and let them know you would like to pay with Dining Dollars. The amount of your purchase is then deducted from your Dining Dollar balance.\nWolf Bucks\nThe\u00a0WolfBucks\u00a0program is a debit-based card system that virtually eliminates the need to carry cash on campus! Simply deposit funds into your account, and enjoy the convenience of being able to make purchases at participating locations by swiping your Seawolf I.D. card!\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    2023 Summer Housing  \n\n\nSummer Housing Option 2023\nRent pricing is per person/per night and is based on the occupancy of the room.\u00a0Posted rates are for\u00a0Summer 2023\u00a0and are subject to change for future summers.\u00a0\u00a0The Alsace building in Beaujolais Village has been designated as the building to house SSU students over the summer.\u00a0 Alsace is apartment style accommodation with 4 bedrooms each with a private bathroom in the apartment.\nSingle Room: $40/night\nCurrent Spring Resident\nPlease plan ahead.\u00a0 Spring 2023 residents will transition to a summer assignment the last week of May.\u00a0 Spring residents living in Alsace will also be reassigned to a new apartment for the summer.\u00a0 They will not remain in the same apartment.\u00a0\nAdditional information\u00a0about\u00a0summer housing\u00a0and it's options will be posted in April.
