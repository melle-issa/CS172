Whether you are a clarinetist interested in symphonic experience, a dancer with a deep background in modern practice, a singer with a passion for choir or opera, or a mariachi violinist - you\u2019ll find a range of engaging options to meet your interests. \n\u00a0\nAll undergraduate music and dance majors have ensemble performance requirements in the BA, BM or BFA degrees. Some of the School\u2019s groups are open by audition only, while others are open to a wider population of performers seeking to participate in music or dance activities while attending the university. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nBands\nChamber Music\nChoir\nJazz Ensembles\nMarching & Pep Bands\nOpera\nOrchestra\nWorld Music\nUniversity Dance Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews / Announcements\nPSFA Student Q&A: Dayne Sakazaki\n            As we enter the fall \u201821 semester, the College of Professional Studies and Fine Arts wants to know how students are adjusting.
