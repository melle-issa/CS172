Each day, from May 7 to May 27, 2023, the WordPress Make Marketing blog will feature five WordPress-related prompts:\nBlogging: WordPress-related questions or suggestions for a related action that can be expressed through writing, video, audio, or visual/digital art. The key is to post your responses on a WordPress blog or website, showcasing the versatility of WordPress as a platform.\n\nDeveloping: These prompts are for those who want to participate on the technical side of the platform, from testing and pull requests to building blocks.\u00a0\n\nDesigning: With an emphasis on designing and creation, these prompts aim to inspire the creative minds who bring WordPress to life visually.\n\nPhotography: Aimed at anyone who likes to take pictures, prompts for contributions to the WordPress Photo Directory will bring our worlds together while enriching our community\u2019s visual resources.\n\nCommunity:  Actions to support the WordPress community and the project as a whole. These prompts are meant to foster contribution and connection among community members.\nMix and match your focus for each day, or create your own daily action and let your WordPress memories, skills, and passion shine!\nParticipants who share at least one action during the campaign as a comment on a #WP20 From Blogs to Blocks post will have the achievement acknowledged by the Marketing team  (and possibly on their WordPress.org profile). Participants who share an action on all 20 posts before WCUS in August 2023 will get an additional acknowledgement of their accomplishment. We can\u2019t wait to celebrate your commitment and your contributions to our thriving community!\nLet\u2019s celebrate the past, present, and future of WordPress, and continue empowering each other to build a better web for everyone.\u00a0\u00a0\n#WP20 From Blogs to Blocks starts May 7, 2023.\nSubscribe to the marketing blog to get the daily prompt post sent directly to your inbox (sign up in the sidebarSidebar A sidebar in WordPress is referred to a widget-ready area used by WordPress themes to display information that is not a part of the main content.

As the Make Marketing team updates the content of what\u2019s in the Showcase, the team should aim to elevate and maintain the integrity of the platform. Read more on the additional background on the efforts to reinvigorate the Showcase.This is an excellent opportunity to get involved in a way that helps shape how others, especially those who aren\u2019t intimately familiar with WordPress might come to view the excellent work that brands with their teams or designers, developers, and marketers are doing while utilizing WordPress.In order to fix the aforementioned issues, allow Showcase to reach its fullest potential, and make moderation sustainable, I\u2019m proposing the following steps be taken:\nLimit the WordPress.orgWordPress.org The community site where WordPress code is created and shared by the users. This is where you can download the source code for WordPress core, plugins and themes as well as the central location for community conversations and organization.  https://wordpress.org/ Showcase to 100 entries. Unlike the Photos Directory, websites aren\u2019t static, they change frequently. Staying on top of which sites are still running and still using WordPress has been an ongoing and growing issue. Limiting the Showcase to the 100 most sites resolves this issue and also guarantees that the showcased sites are also fresh, demonstrating the latest and greatest WordPress possibilities. Bonus: Develop a script to automatically unpublish any sites still running on an old version within 30 days of a new release.\nGet details and data. The showcase should be more than just \u2018shiny and new\u2019 or a collection of Fortune 500 companies. Digging in and getting details like how the website was created will help answer the question of \u201cWhy is this in the Showcase?\u201d MetaMeta Meta is a term that refers to the inside workings of a group. For us, this is the team that works on internal WordPress sites like WordCamp Central and Make WordPress. data that helps to answer this question will be prioritized throughout the curation process.\nReduce categoryCategory The 'category' taxonomy lets you group posts / content together that share a common bond. Categories are pre-defined and broad ranging. noise. Have fun with tags. The Showcase previously used an arbitrary collection of tags for navigation. Rather than carry that forward, there is an opportunity to simplify navigation through the use of select categories. Tags can then be used to arbitrarily group sites by technology, theme, host, etc. This will help keep the collection of sites and add some quirk and joy as well.\nUpdate the submission form to include additional metadata. While the Showcase has previously used single-sentence site descriptions, the hope is to expand entries to tell more of the story behind the sites. Adding form fields for the site creator, country of origin, and story (background) gives visitors insight into how these sites are built. These fields can also make the content creation process easier.\nMaintain and manage the list. While each site on the Showcase will embody the spirit of what it means to be powered by WordPress, some brands\u2019 notoriety will underscore the breadth of what\u2019s possible with WordPress. Keeping such sites as evergreen \u2014 or pinned \u2014 will be in the best interest of visitors. Innovation is also a key way of keeping the showcase fresh and some entries will help balance the showcase with evergreen content and user-generated submissions to help show off the beauty of WordPress.\nCreate credibility and trust. Adopting a policy that refreshes a portion of the showcase, rotating through new various sites, allows the WordPress Project to stay true to values like fostering creativity and innovation on the platform. When the Showcase exemplifies what\u2019s possible, the Project will live its values. Brands that might make sense from a name recognition point of view might be best represented on /enterprise rather than the showcase.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nSharing some of these thoughts with you and listening to your observations and ideas is a critical step in making the Showcase a valuable and successful brand asset. The project will only benefit from its collective community voice as it works to show off some of the excellent work that\u2019s being done out in the wild world wide web!\nSo what do you think? Do these guidelines capture a strong way of revitalizing the Showcase? Please share your thoughts and ideas. Or join in the discussion on GitHub.\n#showcaseLogin to ReplyTo-do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJonathan Desrosiers\n\n1:16 pm on April 19, 2023 \n\n\n\nTags: make.wordpress.org/community ( 13 ), p2-xpost ( 69 ) \u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\nX-post: Cultivating More Effective Contributing on Contributor Days\n\n\nX-comment from +make.wordpress.org/community: Comment on Cultivating More Effective Contributing on Contributor DaysLogin to ReplyTo-do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSantana Inniss\n\n3:05 pm on April 18, 2023 \n\n\n\nTags: Marketing Team ( 152 ), Meeting Notes ( 87 ) \u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\nNotes: Global Marketing Team meeting, 11 April 2023\n\n\nPlease add any comments on the related Marketing Tasks GitHub issue or in the #marketing channel on the Make WordPress SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform https://slack.com/.

There was a drop in Twitter followers this week, but not related to content performance, but rather a small number of deactivated accounts on the platform. Despite the drops in Twitter, we still managed to improve our score by 991 net-new followers. However, the real winner this week is in our engagement. While we saw fewer impressions overall, we actually increased our engagement levels by 46.3% (7,045 total) and a 2.3% engagement percentage based on impressions.\nThe overall performance came from the WP 6.2 campaign. This campaign ended up with all 3 of the top 3 posts for the week, as excitement builds for the release and has garnered lots of attention.\nHere is a look at some of the performance numbers for the last week:\nImpressions: 300,977\nEngagements: 7,045\nLink clicks: 2,030\nEngagement Rate: 2.3%\n\nCollaboration Session\n#114 Discussion: Create plan for short-form video content on Tiktok\n#187 Develop shortform video content and related copy with Learn Team\nThis conversation focused on creating a plan for short-form video content on TikTok and developing short-form video content and related copy with Learn Team. Jetpack offers a Story BlockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. that could be used to make short-form content for TikTok, and LearnWP has Jetpack enabled. Currently, the Learn team is focusing more on clips and shorter versions of more traditional tutorials, but the original marketing ticket was intended to look at activating the WordPress TikTok account and using that vertical, quick in-and-out format. \nThe group discussed using the same videos on several sources in a vertical format, as well as multi-purposing the content to maximize its use. They suggest creating bite-sized hacks/tips content from existing tutorials instead of creating standalone, unconnected content. The group also plans to explore using the Jetpack stories block on a disposable site and to hold a Zoom session to discuss it. \nThe team discussed the use of TikTok for WordPress promotion, and Dan expressed his reservations about its effectiveness due to policy and government issues, the fact that people don\u2019t go to TikTok to learn about WordPress, and that TikTok wouldn\u2019t provide long-term value as a storage place for videos. However, the team pointed out that vertical videos could also be used on other platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Jetpack Stories. The team also noted that TikTok can be viewed from the viewpoint that it is now the second-leading search engine for younger adults behind Google. When viewed as discovery tool rather than just a friend-to-friend chat app, it begins to see greater importance. \nThe team also discussed the need for content creators and suggested that the Learn/training team would be the primary creators, and that the person on camera doesn\u2019t have to be the one who knows the content. Santana suggested revisiting a proposal to launch a pilot program, \u201cA low-effort, time-limited test could help us begin answering some of those questions.\u201d\n The team decided to dedicate the next coffee break to explore Jetpack Stories and how that feature could be used to develop and publish short-form vertical content on WP.org.\n\nGoogle Analytics Statistics for Docs and Learn\nThis conversation focused on whether there are statistics available for WP.org docs sites and who has access to them. Estelaris asked if there were any statistics available. Courtney suggested LearnWP is looking for similar stats. EidolonNight responded that they had access to Google Analytics and had previously provided stats to Hugh for Training; they can provide data on one-off requests, but there are some unspecified issues and caveats with the current Google Analytics setup. The LearnWP team is looking for more data on video playtime and would like to connect GA to their team email that only Learn Faculty have logins for. Dan Soschin will need to do some digging on Learn video performance as there have been difficulties connecting the dots in the past.\n\n#201 Develop a widgetWidget A WordPress Widget is a small block that performs a specific function. You can add these widgets in sidebars also known as widget-ready areas on your web page. WordPress widgets were originally created to provide a simple and easy-to-use way of giving design and structure control of the WordPress theme to the user. for WordPress dashboard to offer Mobile app installation\n#204 Mobile app promotion campaign\nThe conversation centered around developing a widget for the WordPress dashboard to offer mobile app installation and promoting mobile app marketing campaigns. The team discussed how the mobile app could be promoted and its possible promotion with a link in the WordPress dashboard. A member requested feedback from the mobile team about the idea, and another suggested that planning for the campaign should start early on, so they are ready when the mobile upgrades are complete. The team also mentioned the new mobile support forumSupport Forum WordPress Support Forums is a place to go for help and conversations around using WordPress. Also the place to go to report issues that are caused by errors with the WordPress code and implementations. that the mobile team has been working on for a few months.\nThe group continued the discussion of the mobile app dashboard widget, suggesting that it should be a marketing tool that links to a download page on dot-org with details and various download links, whereas the current Mobile page is extremely sparse. Many members emphasized that the mobile app can bring a lot of value to WordPress users, but many of them are not aware that it even exists. The team discussed additional ideas for promoting the mobile app, such as dashboard widgets, materials for meetups, and more. The group also suggested adding the mobile team to the conversation to provide more information and support for the promotion campaign. Three team members will work to combine the two tickets into a more specific ticket covering the mobile conversation to move it forward.\n\nNext Steps\nOur next meeting is 04 April, 2023 at 15:00 UTC.\nGitHub card for the next meeting: https://github.com/WordPress/Marketing-Team/issues/208\n#jetpack, #meeting-notes, #mobile, #short-form-video, #statisticsLogin to ReplyTo-do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\u2190 Older posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\nEmail Updates\n\n\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail Address\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJoin 284 other subscribers\t\t\t\t\n\nRecent UpdatesRecent CommentsTo DoDoneNo RepliesRecent UpdatesRecent CommentsTo DoDoneNo RepliesRecent Activity\n\n\n\t\t\tTeam Pledges\n\t\t\n\n1509 people have pledged time to contribute to Marketing Team efforts!
