They are intended to foster the development of short- and long-term research programs that span disciplines and academic units, thereby making it possible for faculty members to acquire extramural resources for which they might not otherwise qualify. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore UCI Centers & Institutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCI biomedical engineer Kyriacos Athanasiou wins $6 million CIRM grant \n\n\n\n\t\t\tMay 1, 2023\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nRead on UCI News\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy shows importance of patient-reported outcomes in diabetes management care model \n\n\n\n\t\t\tApr 21, 2023\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nRead on UCI News\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUC Irvine biologists discover bees to be brew masters of the insect world \n\n\n\n\t\t\tApr 20, 2023\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nRead on UCI News\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUC Irvine\u2019s Leo Chavez elected to membership in the American Academy of Arts & Sciences \n\n\n\n\t\t\tApr 19, 2023\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nRead on UCI News\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHallmarks to improving pancreatic cancer therapy identified by UCI researchers \n\n\n\n\t\t\tApr 13, 2023\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nRead on UCI News\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. S.
