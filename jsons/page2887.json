Course and GPA requirements for UCR and many of the majors are a lot more attainable than you may realize. With over 80 desirable majors, distinguished faculty, groundbreaking research, and successful graduates, UCR has for the fourth consecutive year been named as U.S. News & World Report's #1 public university in the nation for social mobility.\nExplore Admissions \n\n\n\nAffordability\nThanks to available benefits, scholarships, and grants, most student veterans pay little or nothing out of pocket to attend UCR. Our Financial Aid Veterans Affairs School Certifying Officials (VASCO) will help you work with the VA to get all the education benefits for which you\u2019re eligible. No wonder UCR is ranked as one of the best colleges for your money.

That means at UCR, out-of-state veterans pay the same, lower tuition rate as California residents!\nPlease note: GI Bill\u00ae is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
