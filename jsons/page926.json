She continues to focus her research on \u201cwhat we can learn about odors to improve dogs\u2019 detection,\u201d she says.\u00a0\nFor more than a decade, DeGreeff has sought to make it safer and more effective for dogs to find odors that assist the crime-solving efforts of the FBI, U.S. Navy and other agencies.\nBut even with all her professional achievements, attending Chapman remains one of her most rewarding experiences.\n\u201cI\u2019m very thankful to Chapman for launching the rest of my career,\u201d she says. \u201cThe professors were very supportive.\u201d\nDeGreeff, who became interested in forensic science while studying anthropology at New York University, enrolled in Chapman to get a chemistry degree after graduating from NYU. Christopher Kim, associate dean of academic programs at Chapman\u2019s Schmid College of Science and Technology, recalls DeGreeff as a foundational member of his environmental geochemistry research lab when he started at the university.\n\u201cBack then, she impressed me with both her aptitude and curiosity for independent research as well as her commitment to forensic science,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly rewarding to watch her personal and career progression over the years and to now consider her a colleague in academia.\u201d\nDeGreeff got a bachelor\u2019s in chemistry in two years at Chapman. She was given a special award so she could be included in the honors awards ceremony.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen I graduated from Chapman, I felt like I had direction. I felt like I knew what I really liked, and I had a community,\u201d she says.\nDeGreeff earned her Ph.D. and did a post-doctoral fellowship in the FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism and Forensic Science Research Unit, then worked for a decade in the Naval Research Laboratory.\nShe was drawn to canine detection when a professor talked about it as she started graduate school.\n\u201cI never knew canine detection was a forensic discipline. I thought it was very interesting so I jumped on it, joined the research group. I loved it so much that I never left the field,\u201d she says.\nShe started in forensic science by studying the chemistry of how dogs detect the scent of humans \u2013 living and deceased \u2013 and their blood. She went on to research how dogs alert to other scents important to investigators, like homemade explosives, fentanyl, marijuana and spilled crude oil.\nIn addition, DeGreeff investigates factors, such as contamination, that affect the quality of canine detection training aids, as well as how to make dog training safer and more authentic. At the Naval Research Lab, she invented a device that trains dogs to detect mixed odors found in homemade explosives.\u00a0\nIdeally, dogs are trained in the environments they work in. But with homemade explosives, this could pose a hazard. She created the device \u201cbecause you want the explosive training aid to smell like the real explosive, but not have the hazard of the real explosive,\u201d she says.\nDeGreeff also mentors Ph.D. students and is collaborating on a project examining the movement of odor vapor inside of a dog\u2019s nose with Chapman Assistant Professor of Biological Sciences Lindsay Waldrop.\u00a0\n\u201cThat made me really happy, to be able to write \u2018Chapman University\u2019 on paperwork I\u2019m filling out,\u201d she says.\nUltimately, DeGreeff is driven to apply her scientific expertise in ways that have real-world impact.\u00a0\n\u201cI like to see it help someone,\u201d she says.\nLauryn DeGreeff \u201906\n\nWas awarded the Navy\u2019s Civilian Service Commendation medal in March 2022.\nEdited the recently released book \u201cCanines: The Original Biosensors,\u201d which explores how science enhances the way dogs are used for detection.\nHolds three patents, including one for a tool used around the world for training dogs to detect mixed vapors from homemade explosives.\n\n\n\nalumni alumni news animal research Chapman Magazine chemistry dogs FBI forensic chemistry forensics Navy research Schmid College of Science and Technology \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJoy Juedes \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Impact on Local Community Is More Than Monetary\n\n\n\n\n\nSURF Offers Up-Close Research Opportunity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Awarded $2.2 Million in Federal Funding for Drought and Environmental Research \n\nApril 20, 2023 Rachel Morrison\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurel Tamayo \u201921 Inspires Climate-Friendly Action Through Film Laurel Tamayo \u201921 was recently named one of Forbes\u2019 68 Climate Leaders Changing the Film and Television Industry Tamayo is an Impact Campaign Consultant at Rare Entertainment Lab, a behavior change organization that...\n\n\nApril 19, 2023 Staci Dumoski\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumna Implements Sustainability at Happiest Place on Earth A Chapman University alumna is helping Disneyland Resort meet its ambitious goal of sending zero waste to landfills by 2030.
