Knowing German also opens up opportunities to connect with more than 120 million native speakers worldwide. Additionally, the study of German prepares students to be competitive for graduate school, since many graduate programs require or recommend German. German minors may also have a distinct advantage entering a professional career, in fields such as international business, economics, science, history, global studies, music, or teaching. The SSU German program offers a variety of courses that provide students with linguistic skills and cultural knowledge of the German-speaking world. Students are encouraged to participate in the CSU International Programs and take courses in Germany, which may be counted toward the minor. Students wishing to study abroad are strongly encouraged to consult with their German advisor to ensure that courses taken abroad can be applied to the German minor.

Project Management has always been practiced informally, but it began to emerge as a distinct profession in the mid-20th century. Today, project management is one of the top skills demanded by successful organizations around the world.\nSonoma State University offers two project management courses:\u00a0traditional\u00a0and\u00a0agile. Although traditional project management usually involves the creation of a physical product such as a building, and agile project management often involves the creation of an intellectual product, such as a software program,\u00a0either approach may be deemed the most appropriate for the situation. Traditional techniques have been used for years to manage large software projects; and some organizations in rapidly evolving markets are successfully employing agile techniques to develop physical products and/or prototypes.\u00a0\nIn addition to a certificate from Sonoma State University, both courses will prepare you to take the appropriate certification examinations offered by the Project Management Institute\u00ae.\n\n\n\nSchool of Extended and International Education\n(707) 664-2394\nPM Website\n\n\n \n\n\nPsychology is the study of mind, behavior and experience.
