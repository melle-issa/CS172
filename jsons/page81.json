Schools / Departments\nDiversity and Inclusion Plans are an opportunity for units to articulate their goals\n                              with respect to equity, diversity and inclusion for all faculty, staff and students\n                              as part of their mission of excellence in education and scholarship. A good plan requires\n                              understanding how well the unit is (or isn\u2019t) currently supporting students, staff\n                              and faculty from diverse backgrounds; developing a shared vision of the environment\n                              that the unit wishes to create; and considering metrics for evaluating progress toward\n                              shared goals. The process of creating these plans is therefore an opportunity for\n                              units to engage in important conversations about values and priorities, and to think\n                              strategically about what changes are needed to reach stated goals. At the end of the\n                              development progress, these plans will help guide the unit as changes are implemented\n                              and progress is evaluated; at the same time, plans themselves will continue to evolve\n                              as departments and units continue to grow and develop.\n                           \nDepartment / School Plans vs. College Plans\nIn September 2019, the University Senate changed the deadline for the Department/School\n                              Plans to March 2021. The two primary differences for the school / department plans,\n                              compared to the college plans, are a) they will be expected to discuss strategies\n                              that will align with the goals laid out in their college's plan (which should be approved\n                              in Fall 2020), and b) they should include analysis of equity gaps in student achievement\n                              and strategies to improve faculty and staff support of students. In particular, the\n                              Senate DEI committee has provided the following recommendations for school/department\n                              plans (approved at March 2020 Senate meeting):\n                           \n\nGiven that all colleges should have approved plans by November 2020, department and\n                                 school plans should indicate how the individual department or school will support\n                                 the goals outlined in the college plans;\n                              \nSimilar to the college plans, department and school plans should indicate how the\n                                 individual department or school will support the research based strategies to improve equity-minded hiring;\n                              \nDepartment and school plans should include an explicit analysis of equity gaps in student achievement;\n                              \nDepartment and school plans should include strategies to improve faculty competencies\n                                 with equity-minded teaching practices and inclusive pedagogies; and\n                              \nDepartment and school plans should include strategies to improve staff competences\n                                 with inclusive student support practices.\n                              \n\nIn addition, in response to the events of this spring and summer, each department\n                              is charged with reviewing existing coursework and/or developing new curricula to advance\n                              racial and social justice, anti-racism, and cultural diversity across the curriculum.\n                              The template for department / school plans has been updated to reflect all these changes.\n                           \nIn order to support departments and schools, Campus Diversity will again host two\n                              Institutes, tentatively scheduled for December 4, 2020 and February\u00a0March 5, 2021. At the fall Institute, we will walk through using the SDSU and CSU\n                              dashboards to access data on student achievement, analyze disproportionate impact\n                              and begin considering appropriate strategies. At the spring Institute, we will discuss\n                              specific strategies for faculty and staff. As with the Institutes offers in AY1920,\n                              these events are as much an opportunity for planning teams to sit down and work together,\n                              as to provide information. Also, staff from Campus Diversity will be available to\n                              meet with individual departments throughout the year. Please the Associate Chief Diversity\n                              Officer for Faculty and Staff (at [email\u00a0protected]) to arrange such a consultation.\n                           \nPlanning team members are also invited to self-enroll in the Diversity Planning Canvas course Spring 2022 Update\n\n\n\nTimeline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nDepartments / Schools\n\n\n\n\nAugust 2020\n\nRelease of readings, materials, and template\n\n\n\nOctober 2020\n\nSubmit roster\u00a0and commitment forms, team completes pre-readings and implicit bias professional learning\n                                                      \n\n\n\nDecember 2020\n\nInstitute #1 - Equity Gaps, Curricular Review\n\n\n\nMarch\u00a02021\n\nInstitute #2 - Interventions\n\n\n\nMarch 2021\n\nOriginal deadline for submission of completed, final plan; plan submission opens.\n                                                         Plans should be reviewed and revised with support of Councils prior to final submission.\n                                                      \n\n\n\nMay 2021\n\nDeadline for completion of data and curriculum analysis.\n\n\n\nOct 2021\n\nDeadline for submission of FINAL plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground Readings - Departments and Schools\n\n\n\nCommittee members will likely come back to these resources throughout the process.\n\nTaking Equity-Minded Action to Close Equity Gaps (Lindsey Malcom-Piqueux & Estela Bensimon)\n                                          \nBridging the Research to Practice Gap: Achieving Mission-Driven Diversity and Inclusion\n                                                Goals (Taylor, et al, 2016)\n                                          \nFive Principles for Enacting Equity by Design (Estela Bensimon, Alicia Dowd & Keith Witham)\n                                          \nLanguage of Appeasement (Dafina-Lazarus Stewart, 2017)\n                                          \nPrinciples of Antiracist Teaching & Reflection (Multiculturalism, Race & Ethnicity in Classics Consortium (MRECC)) [Note: although\n                                             compiled by Classics scholars, the principles here apply to all fields]\n                                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Preparation\n\n\n\n\nProfessional learning seminar on implicit bias and microaggressions offered by the\n                                             Professors of Equity.

However, your plan will still need to be submitted for\n                                          review and approval at the university level.\n                                       \nOur department just went / is going through Academic Program Review and we included\n                                          a lot of similar material in that. Do we need to do that work all over again?\n                                       \nYou absolutely can (and should!) re-use pieces of your APR self-study. Much of the\n                                          data on student outcomes, in particular, should be similar to what is expected in\n                                          APRs so you can just cut and paste those sections.\n                                       \nThe March 2021 deadline seems too soon, given everything going on with COVID. What\n                                          if we need more time?\n                                       \nDepartments now have until October to submit their full, final plans. However, in\n                                          order to ensure everyone does keep moving forward, you will be asked to complete the\n                                          first two sections (data analysis and curricular review) before the end of the 2021\n                                          academic year.\n                                       \nDoesn't requiring us to change our curriculum impose on our academic freedom?\nThe requirement is not necessarily to change your curriculum but to review courses\n                                          and curriculum with an eye to how you might better advance social justice within your\n                                          discipline. This certainly could result in a departmental decision to develop new\n                                          courses or revise existing course; it could also mean making existing efforts more\n
