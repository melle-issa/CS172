Argyros Forum Student Union and is designed to explore and affirm the different identities reflected in the Chapman University student population. \u00a0By participating in the campaign, and choosing three aspects of their identities to feature,\u00a0students help the University affirm the diversity among Chapman students and foster a campus climate that welcomes and values the diversity within each student.\u00a0 The campaign encourages students to consider that, when we have a deeper understanding of our own identity, and empathy for the identities of others, we create a stronger and more inclusive community.\u00a0 Since it\u2019s inception in Fall 2014, more than 200 students have participated in the campaign.\nWhile not every student will be featured in an I Am Chapman exhibit, all students are eligible to participate and can do so by completing the I AM Chapman Campaign Submission Form.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSamantha Tong\n                        The I Am Chapman campaign
