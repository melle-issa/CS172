in the 1820s\u20131830s, ornithological conservation of any kind was hardly discussed, particularly when the birds he described seemed so overwhelmingly abundant: \u201cThe air was literally filled with pigeons; the light of noon-day was obscured as by an eclipse.\u201d Since then, human threats to avian wildlife have mounted, as many species have been hunted to extinction or near-extinction for food, sport, and fashion\u2014or threatened by urban development, climate change, and overuse of fertilizers and pesticides. \n      \n\n            DML - Treasure Room\n
