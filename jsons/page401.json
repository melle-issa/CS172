If you are a student, please contact Vaden Health Center for guidance.\n\u00a0\nSymptoms GuidanceAs symptoms change, faculty, staff, and postdocs may re-submit Health Check for updates to recommended guidelines. Please also take the following actions:\nCovid test. We recommend completing a COVID test. If you test positive during this time, you are required to submit the result via Health Check. Please refer to this webpage for information on obtaining rapid antigen tests. If you have any questions regarding testing or would like to receive guidance on accessing PCR testing, please submit a help ticket.\nWear a high-quality (KN95, N95) face mask. If you test negative for COVID and feel able to work as your symptoms improve, you should wear a face mask on Stanford campuses for at least 10 days from when symptoms began. Please note that there are a number of infectious respiratory viruses actively circulating, including influenza and RSV, and our goal is also to minimize the spread of non-COVID illness.\nContact your personal physician for health care. We strongly encourage you to contact your physician with any questions about diagnosis, medical evaluation, and treatment. If you have urgent or critical medical needs, please visit your nearest emergency department. Signs you should seek emergency medical attention, or call 9-11, include:\n\nTrouble breathing\nPersistent pain or pressure in the chest\nNew confusion\nInability to wake or stay awake\nPale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone\n\nClose Contact Exposure GuidanceThe CDC defines a close contact as someone who was within 6 feet of an individual who tested positive for COVID, masked or unmasked, during their infectivity period, for 15 minutes or more in a 24-hour period. \nPer CDC guidance, please tell your close contacts that you have tested positive. Please refer to this CDC resource on How To Talk To Your Close Contacts.\u00a0\nIn alignment with\u00a0Santa Clara County guidance, close contacts who are asymptomatic are no longer required to quarantine, regardless of vaccination status.\nStanford asks faculty, staff, and postdocs who meet the definition of a close contact to please take the following actions:\n\nCOVID test.\u00a0We recommend completing a\u00a0COVID- test today and, if negative, again on days 3, 4, and 5 after your close-contact exposure.\u00a0If you test positive during this time, you are required to submit the result via\u00a0Health Check.\nIf you develop symptoms following your exposure,\u00a0please complete Health Check and remain off-site, as symptoms following a close-contact exposure would be presumed to be COVID, until proven otherwise.\nWear a high-quality (KN95, N95) face mask.\u00a0You\u00a0must\u00a0wear a face mask on Stanford campuses for at least 10 days from your last close contact exposure.\n\nIf you have questions on the Health Check guidance, please\u00a0submit a help ticket.\nHousehold Exposure GuidanceA household exposure is when someone you live with (i.e., a roommate, significant other/intimate partner/child) tests positive for COVID.\nIn alignment with\u00a0Santa Clara County guidance, close contacts who are asymptomatic are no longer required to quarantine, regardless of vaccination status.\nStanford asks faculty, staff, and postdocs who meet the definition of a household exposure to please take the following actions:\n\nCOVID test.\u00a0We recommend completing a\u00a0COVID- test today and, if negative, every day prior to coming to work ANY Stanford campus,\u00a0until 5 days have passed since your last household exposure. If you test positive during this time, you are required to submit the result via\u00a0Health Check.\nIf you develop symptoms following your exposure,\u00a0please complete HealthCheck and remain off-site, as symptoms following a high-risk or household exposure would be presumed to be COVID, until proven otherwise.\nWear a high-quality (KN95, N95) face mask.\u00a0You\u00a0must\u00a0wear a face mask on Stanford campuses for at least 10 days from your last close-contact exposure.\n\nIf you have questions on the Health Check guidance, please\u00a0submit a help ticket.\nCOVID-Related Leave and Remote WorkIf you feel healthy enough to work, and are concerned about your COVID-like symptoms or exposure status, please work with your supervisor to determine whether you are able to work remotely.\nIf you are not feeling healthy enough to work, please contact your supervisor and follow your normal protocols for outages due to illness.\nIf you have any questions about leave, please contact your local Human Resources representative.\nFor questions related to Stanford\u2019s response to COVID-19 or other health concerns, please fill out this\u00a0EH&S Health Guidance form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Information\n\nTesting PositiveSymptoms & ExposureCOVID-19 TestingCOVID-19 VaccinationFace Mask GuidanceVisitors and VendorsCleaning and DisinfectionPotential Exposure Building List\n\n\n\nRelevant For\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram Areas\n\n\nBiosafety & BiosecurityEmergency ManagementEnvironmental ProtectionFire SafetyHealth PhysicsLaboratory SafetyOccupational Health CenterOccupational Safety & HealthTraining & Communications\n\n\n\nRoles\n\nBuilding ManagersConstruction ManagersExternal ContractorsHR ManagersLab ManagersLab ResearchersLab Safety CoordinatorsOffice WorkersParents and FamiliesPrincipal InvestigatorsShops WorkersSupervisors/ManagersUniversity Safety Partners\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nAnimal Research Occupational Health and Safety ProgramBiosafety & BiosecurityCampus SafetyChemical SafetyConstruction and MaintenanceCOVID-19 InformationEco/Sustainable PracticesEmergency PreparednessErgonomicsField Research SafetyFire SafetyGeneral Workplace SafetyHazardous MaterialsHealthy BuildingsLab SafetyLab Setup and ShutdownLaser SafetyOccupational Injury and IllnessRadiation SafetyShop / Makerspace SafetyWaste Disposal\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\nCOVID-19 InformationAbout UsBioRAFTChemical Inventory SystemFind an EH&S SpecialistLessons LearnedRecycling and Disposal GuideRegister for TrainingReport a Safety ConcernRequest ServicesSubmit Work RequestWaste TagWeather ConditionsSafety Store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n484 Oak Road, Stanford, CA 94305-8007Phone: 650-723-0448\n\n\nDirections Careers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSU Home\nMaps & Directions\nSearch Stanford\nTerms of Use\nEmergency Info\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University,  Stanford, California 94305.\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\tCopyright Complaints\n\n\n\n\n Back to Top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload full instructions here -> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
