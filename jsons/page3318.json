We hope the following resources support current staff and faculty in their efforts to foster an inclusive and equitable environment at Chico State.Faculty and Staff AssociationsA curated list of diversity oriented groups within the campus community.Teaching ResourcesThe Research in Equity, Antiracism, Diversity, and Inclusion Hub shares best practices in faculty instruction and research.Diversity TrainingsGet certified to better serve the diverse members of our campus or learn to avoid bias in hiring.What it\u2019s like to work at Chico StateChristine HerreraAssistant Professor, Mathematics and Statistics Department\u201cThe students who come to Chico State enter with an awe-inspiring yearning to learn and grow. They are sponges who strive to gather as much knowledge and experience to become the best versions of themselves. They work hard in and out of the classroom to make a better life for themselves, their families, and their communities.\u201dMalcolm McLemoreDirector, Cross Cultural Leadership Center\u201cNot all students have that \u2018aha\u2019 moment, or even have it easy to get to that \u2018aha\u2019 moment. Some students, it takes one conversation and it\u2019s done. Others may take one or two years\u2014I say that because I was one of those students. It took a few years for me to get it right. But once they get it right, it\u2019s a beautiful moment.\u201dHyewon PechkisAssistant Professor, Physics Department\u201cI once was a first-generation student who didn't know how to forge a path ahead. As a minority and female, guiding and supporting first-generation students and underrepresented groups means more than just teaching to me. In some sense, I am paying back what I got from my teachers and friends along the way to get here.\u201dCareer OpportunitiesWe are looking for outstanding candidates\u00a0who reflect the diverse, intercultural, and intersectional identities of our student body.\u00a0We want faculty and staff who embrace student success and eliminating achievement gaps, have demonstrated experience working with diverse populations, and will contribute to policies, programs, and activities that support an inclusive, accessible, and equitable learning and working environment.Explore Available PositionsLearn More About Chico StateIn the SpotlightFostering Inclusivity in the ClassroomOffice of the PresidentKendall Hall, Room 105530-898-5201president@csuchico.eduwww.csuchico.edu/presOther DivisionsAcademic AffairsBusiness and FinanceCalifornia Faculty Association(opens in new window)Information TechnologyStudent AffairsUniversity Advancement\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.Contact UsNeed Help?FacebookFacebookTwitterTwitterInstagramInstagramReport an accessibility issueReport a broken link on this pageTitle IXPrivacy PolicyCalifornia State University, Chico400 West First StreetChico, CA 95929Copyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n",
