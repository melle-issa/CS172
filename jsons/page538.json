The stunning beauty of the 269-acre campus is just part of what makes Sonoma State a unique liberal arts university. The residential campus houses one-third of its students, with plenty of on-campus\u00a0activities and off-campus excursions throughout the Bay Area. SSU\u2019s unique programs and small class sizes ensure you\u2019ll get the individual attention you need to succeed. We invite you to come see for yourself what makes Sonoma State one of the California State University\u2019s most popular campuses.\nThe Seawolf\u00a0Experience\u00a0\nLife on campus is active and busy. Our students excel academically while enjoying leisurely activities with friends. Hangout spots, like Seawolf Plaza, the StudentCenter, Charlie Brown's Cafe or Lobo's Pizza and Pub, buzz with activity. Cultivate connections with fellow students by attending cultural events and student performances, cheering on the Seawolves at athletic events, or joining a Greek organization. Do more here, at Sonoma State.\nGet Involved\nPursue academic, creative and cultural interests through our student organizations, or develop your inner leader in student government.\u00a0\n\u00bb Campus Life\nGet Active\nWork out at the recreation center, swim laps at the pool or venture on one of the many hikes through our Outdoor Pursuits program.\u00a0\n\u00bb Campus Rec\nSee the World\nHave the experience of a lifetime studying or completing a class in more than 15 countries.\u00a0\n\u00bb Study Abroad\nNoma Nation\nEvery year we field 14 competitive NCAA Division II men's and women's sports teams, most of which compete in the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA). In addition, we have a variety of intramural leagues that play on a competitive and recreational level. In 2015-16, a school record 93 student-athletes earned All-Academic honors from their respective conferences and for the second consecutive year, student-athletes set a new department GPA record.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNCAA Division II Sports\nBaseball\u00a0\nBasketball (M + W)\nCross Country (W)\nGolf (M + W)\nSoccer\u00a0(M + W)\nSoftball\nTennis\u00a0(M + W)\nTrack & Field (W)\nVolleyball (W)\n\n\nSports Clubs with Interleague Play\nArchery\u00a0\nBaseball\u00a0\nCheer\nDance\nEquestrian\nFishing\u00a0\nHockey\nJiu Jitsu\nLacrosse\nRowing\nRugby\u00a0\nSnow\nSoccer\nSpikeball\u00a0\nTriathlon\nUltimate Frisby\nVolleyball\u00a0\n\n\nLive Smart\nLiving on campus is one of the best decisions you can make.

Students must apply and be accepted to a specific learning community, as space is limited.\u00a0\nSuites + Apartments\nEach housing option includes fully furnished bedrooms, living rooms, and modern kitchens. Unique benefits, such as 24-hour laundry access, unlimited meal plans, swimming pools and spas are also available.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmissions\n\nAdmissions Home\nSeawolf Decision Day\nExperience SSUCampus Tours\nWestern Undergraduate Exchange (WUE)\nVirtual Application Advising Appointments\nYour Outreach Counselors\nExplore Sonoma County\nLet's Finish What You Started!\nAdmitted Student Receptions\nLatino Family Educational Summit\nNext Steps Presentations\nVirtual Discover SSU\n\nI Want to Apply\nResources by Class Level\nHow to Submit Transcripts\nI Have Applied\nI Have Been Admitted\nPrepare for Enrollment\nAdmissions Forms\nLate Application and Admissions Reconsideration\nParent Corner\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYoutube\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Ave\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n707.664.2880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact SSU\nPrivacy Notice\nCalifornia State University\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSafeSSU\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\nJobs\nTitle IX\nEmergency Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
