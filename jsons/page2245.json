The nine distinct categories allow centers and leaders to select areas where they feel they are making the most impact. The 2022 GCEC Awards were announced at the annual awards ceremony during the 2022 GCEC Conference in Las Vegas hosted by UNLV. The 2023 Awards season will kick off in mid-May.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2022 Awards Press Release\u00a0\u00a0 Past Winners\u00a0 \u00a0View 2022 Awards (PDF)\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCongratulations to the 2022 GCEC Award Winners\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNasdaq Center for Entrepreneurial Excellence, schools with less than 5,000 students:\nBabson College, The Arthur M.

For more information on the process, you can view the awards submission instructions.\n\u00a0\nNew in 2021, so still kind of new:\nThere are now two tracks for three of the award categories: 1) for smaller schools with 5,000 or fewer students, and 2) for larger schools with more than 5,000 students. Judges this year may award two awards in these three categories:\n\u00a0\n\nOutstanding Emerging Entrepreneurship Center\nOutstanding Student Engagement and Leadership\nNasdaq Center of Entrepreneurial Excellence\n\n\u00a0\nThe purpose of this change is to allow smaller schools with excellent programs to be recognized, even if they might not have access to the same resources as larger schools.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPast GCEC Award Winners\n\n\n\nCategory and Year Awarded\nAward Recipients\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellence in Specialty Entrepreneurship\u00a0Education\n\n\n\n2022\nHouston Community College \u2013 Office of Entrepreneurial Initiatives (OEI)\n\n\n2021 (2 awardees)\nInstitute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, University of Texas at Dallas\u00a0and\u00a0NYU Entrepreneurial Institute, New York University\n\n\n2020 (3 awardees)\nUniversity of Colorado-Boulder (Entrepreneurship Center for Music)Georgia State University (Entrepreneurship and Innovation Institute)George Washington University (Office of Innovation & Entrepreneurship)\n\n\n2019\nRutgers University \u2013 Center for Urban Entrepreneurship & Economic Development (CUEED)\n\n\n2018\nBabson College (Center for Women\u2019s Entrepreneurial Leadership)\n\n\n2017\nCUNY Graduate School of Journalism (Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism)\n\n\n2016\nUniversity of Vermont (Sustainable Entrepreneurship MBA)Duke University\u00a0 (Center for Advancement of Social Entrepreneurship)\n\n\n2013\nBall State University (The Entrepreneurship Center)\n\n\n2012\nUniversity of Florida\n\n\n2011\nMiami University (Institute for Entrepreneurship) University of Rochester (Center for Entrepreneurship)\n\n\n2009\nRice University (Rice Alliance for Technology and Entrepreneurship)MIT (MIT Entrepreneurship Center)\n\n\n2008\nUniversity of North Carolina-Chapel Hill\n\n\n2007\nUniversity of Illinois-Chicago\n\n\n2006\nUniversity of Colorado at Boulder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding Contributions to Venture Creation\n\n\n\n2022 (2 awardees)\nSchulze School of Entrepreneurship, University of St. Thomas (Minnesota) and Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station\n\n\n2021 (2 awardees)\nNYU Entrepreneurial Institute, New York University\u00a0and\u00a0Gary S.
