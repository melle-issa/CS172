Pfau Library. CSUSB has been ranked among the best universities in the nation in three categories by Washington Monthly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCal State San Bernardino has been ranked among the best universities in the nation in three categories according to Washington Monthly\u2019s 2021 College Guide and Rankings.\nCSUSB was ranked seventh out of 616 colleges in the Master\u2019s University category, ninth out of 215 colleges in the Best Bang for the Buck in the West category, and listed among America\u2019s Best Colleges for Student Voting.\n\u201cWe are proud to once again be recognized by Washington Monthly as it highlights our commitment to provide our students with an excellent, affordable education. It also shows our successful efforts in encouraging our students to fulfill their civic duty and make a difference,\u201d said university president Tom\u00e1s D. Morales. \u201cI applaud our faculty and staff as these rankings show their hard work and dedication to CSUSB.\u201d\nAccording to its website, Washington Monthly\u2019s Master\u2019s Universities category is for institutions that award a significant number of master\u2019s degrees but few or no doctoral degrees. It ranks four-year schools based on their contribution to the public good in three broad categories: social mobility, research, and providing opportunities for public service. In addition to CSUSB, which ranked seventh, six California State University campuses made the top 10.\nIn its Best Bang for the Buck category, which is organized by five regions, Washington Monthly recognizes the schools where students of modest means get the most for their money. Seven CSUs in the western region, including CSUSB, were listed in the top 10.\n\u201cOur exclusive list of schools (are) ranked according to how well they help non-wealthy students attain marketable degrees at affordable prices,\u201d the Washington Monthly website says. \u201cThe list is created by isolating the social mobility metrics from the main rankings of four-year institutions.\u201d\nThe Best Colleges for Student Voting category recognizes schools that do the most to turn their students into citizens. \n\u201cSpecial credit goes to the many on-campus, student-led groups that worked to get their peers to the polls,\u201d its website says. \u201cBut student organizers have the best chance of success when they are actively supported by their administrations. That\u2019s why each year at the\u00a0Monthly, we release an honor roll listing the colleges doing the most to turn their students into citizens.\u201d\nTo make the list, institutions had to submit action plans to the ALL IN Campus Democracy Challenge for 2018 and 2020 (ALL IN\u00a0helps colleges develop strategies to boost civic engagement). Schools also needed to have signed up to receive data from the National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement (NSLVE), which calculates college-specific registration and voting rates. And they must have made both their NSLVE data available to the public. In short, schools need to have shown a repeated commitment to increasing student voting \u2013 and have been transparent about the results.\nTo view all the 2021 College Guide and Rankings, visit the Washington Monthly website. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore: \n\n\nWashington Monthly\n\n\nrankings\n\n\nmaster\u2019s\n\n\nBest Bang for the Buck\n\n\nvoting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober 20, 2022\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCSUSB recognized as one of the top universities in the nation in Washington Monthly 2022 ranking\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 22, 2020\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCSUSB named one of the best U.S. colleges for student voting \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 11, 2020\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWashington Monthly ranks CSUSB among the nation\u2019s top universities \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Region\n\n\n\nCSUSB\n\n\nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino\n5500 University Parkway\nSan Bernardino, CA 92407\n+1 (909) 537-5000\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Social Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso of InterestForbes ranking lists CSUSB as among the Best...CSUSB designation raised to an R2 Doctoral...CSUSB to offer new certificate program in... \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1 \n\n\n\n\nLogin\n\n\n\n\nmyCoyote\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\nStudent Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB  \nDrupal Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Interest to...\n\n\n\n\nFuture Students\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Students\n   Interests\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nFull-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nPart-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & Visitors\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nAlumni & Friends\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Partners\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nMilitary/Veterans\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 2 \n\n\n\n\nEmployment\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB \nJob Listings\n - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nFaculty Jobs\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nCareer Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHuman Resources\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Employment\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nContact\n  CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nClery Act\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Safety Reports\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTitle IX Notice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure of Consumer Information\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 3 \n\n\n\n\nCampus Services\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Advising\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHousing & Residential Life\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nOmbuds Services\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nParking\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPolice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPsychological Counseling\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nServices to Students with Disabilities\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Health Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Support\n\n\n\n\nTranscripts\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\n\n\n\nNon-Discrimination Notice\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Copyright/DMCA Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
