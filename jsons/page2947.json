Management can help you and your department\u00a0plan for threats and quickly resume operations.\u00a0\nUC Davis Priorities During an Emergency\nPeople:\u00a0The highest priority is the safety of those who live, study and work within the UC Davis campus community.\nProperty:\u00a0Our property collectively constitutes an extraordinarily important resource. As it is intended to support the academic mission of the institution, it must be protected and preserved by any means that do not require our people to assume undue risks.\nMission\u00a0Continuity:\u00a0Beyond the more quantifiable priorities discussed above, there are values, rights, processes and operations that are essential to the identity, reputation and sustainability of the University. That is, the elements of who we are, how we fulfill our responsibilities to each other and the appropriate means to our common goals.\nSafety Applications\n\n\n\n\n\nWarnMe\n\nProvides faculty, staff and students with timely information and instructions during emergencies or other urgent situations that may directly affect their well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrisis Manager\n\nA mobile application that has been populated specifically with the UC Davis campus emergency response guide, providing you with immediate access to emergency response information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEverbridge\n\nEverbridge Mobile App allows users to receive push notifications for WarnMe and Aggie Alert and provides a number of other features customized for\u00a0UC Davis.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency: Call 911\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Response Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice Department Contacts\n\n\nDavis Campus\nEmergency\n\t\t911 or\u00a0530-752-1230\n24-Hour Non-Emergency\n\t\t530-752-1727\n\n\nSacramento Campus\nEmergency\n\t\t911 or\u00a0916-734-2555\n24-Hour Non-Emergency\n\t\t\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b916-734-2555\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of California, Davis, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616 | 530-752-1011\n\nQuestions or comments?
