The students used art to teach visitors about the realms of activism, wellness, and environmental sustainability in an interactive and creative way. Following the United Nations\u2019 recognition of Earth Day in 1970, the event was renamed to the Whole Earth Festival, fondly nicknamed as \u201cWEF,\u201d and has since evolved into a free student-run event, attracting over 30,000 visitors annually on Mother\u2019s Day weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n A Family-Friendly & Zero Waste Event\nThe Whole Earth Festival is a family-friendly event. The Regents of the University of California, owners of the UC Davis campus, do not allow drug use on any of its UC campuses. Thank you for keeping our event drug-free. This includes but is not limited to alcohol, tobacco (in both smoke and vapor forms), stimulants, cannabis, hallucinogens, depressants, narcotics, and inhalants.\nThe Whole Earth Festival seeks to be a zero-waste event. We have volunteers actively sorting recyclables and compost from the bins. Please do your part to help out and dispose of your \u201cwaste\u201d in appropriate bins.\nWhen & Where\nMother\u2019s Day Weekend: May 12-14, 2023\n Friday: 12 p.m. \u2013 10 p.m.\nSaturday: 10 a.m. \u2013 10 p.m.\nSunday: 10 a.m. \u2013 6 p.m.\nLocated at the UC Davis Quad\nWe are planning for a fully in-person 2023 festival.
