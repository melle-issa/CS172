Michelle got her start like many of us: writing and hoping for the best, even when sometimes the \u201cbest\u201d takes us down a path we didn\u2019t prepare for. Tea doesn\u2019t hold back in her work as she navigates what being a person trying to stay true to themselves means.\nIn the 90\u2019s, Michelle found herself overwhelmingly surrounded by the testosterone and misogyny found in the literary community. Instead of retreating, she decided to take the initiative, grab the literary community by the balls, and create her own open mic with friend Sini Anderson. This new program, called Sister Spit, strove to create a place for the queer literary community to gather and share their spoken word. Tea\u2019s inspiration to start the group started with questioning:\n\u201cWhere are all the other queer female writers?\u2026They\u2019re not coming cause they don\u2019t feel welcome and it makes sense that they don\u2019t feel welcome. You had to really fight for a space there\u201d (Michelle Tea, Electric Literature).\nAlthough Sister Spit was originally geared towards cis women in the queer community, the fluidity of gender and the social acceptance emerging in the past years have pushed Sister Spit to widen their audience and participant demographics to engage people from all walks of life, so long as they vibe with their original message of \u201cfeminism, queerness, humor and provocation.\u201d\nIn 2003, Michelle created Radar Productions to give the queer community of San Francisco \u00a0access to free and affordable literary arts programs that they weren\u2019t finding in the male-saturated literary community. This nonprofit organization still hosts a traveling Sister Spit tour every year, featuring authors like MariNaomi, Wo Chan, Jay Dodd, and Virgie Tovar. In addition to her work with Radar Productions and Sister Spit, Michelle Tea is the curator for Amethyst Editions, a Feminist Press Imprint, and continues to strive to unapologetically share her art and create an inclusive environment for the queer literary community.\nMichelle Tea\u2019s new, razor-sharp essay collection,\u00a0Against Memoir: Complaints, Confessions & Criticisms, reflects on the cultural artifacts that have challenged and calibrated her against the world. She writes on \u201cArt and Music,\u201d \u201cLove and Queerness,\u201d and her usual spectrum, \u201cWriting and Life.\u201d In her writing, Michelle is someone we all can easily relate to. From pondering her personal struggles, to demonstrating what life means to her, Tea\u2019s life stories allow us to truly understand how our own unique situations are what define us. Her fearless reflection on times of previous struggle has allowed her to see her growth and acceptance, which is something we all can take from. Tea has a knack for slaying her inner demons and conveying her stories to the audience in the most comical way possible. Her overall style makes people think that we can still find light even in the darkest of situations. \nAgainst Memoir rebels against the traditional autobiographical text we have seen in Tea\u2019s previous works. In this essay collection, she interweaves her thoughts and experiences with film, books, and important figures to move past a singular narrative into a collective one about our time. Some of the pieces within the collection have been published from previous speeches, readings, and talks, including one from 2016 at Butte College. Within her work, she keeps her readers entranced with her powerful yet quirky assertions all while offering herself as a model for activism. In her essay, \u201cThe City to a Young Girl,\u201d she says, \u201cI guess that\u2019s my issue with writing as activism: how hard it is for it to change the actual systems that oppress and limit and kill.\u201d Through her writing we see a queer woman who fights for the freedom of those who are chained by the stigma of social and political views. \nOther works by Michelle Tea include Valencia\u2014which has received the Lambda Literary Award for Best Lesbian Fiction, and was adapted into a movie in 2013\u2014and the young adult fantasy trilogy Mermaid In Chelsea Creek, among many others. \nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Michelle Tea this Monday, October 8th at 7:30 in PAC 134 for a reading from Against Memoir, a Q&A, and book signing. Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, Writer\u2019s Voice readings are free and open to the public.\nWritten by Emily Ribeiro and Jazmin Gomez\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nOctober 6, 2018watershedcsuc\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nWR Editor Blog: Marta\u00a0Shaffer \n\n\u201cNot Fucking Fixed in Place\u201d: A Eulogy for My Dad\n\n\nOf course, this is not a real eulogy. My dad did pass away, three weeks ago from when I first started writing this. And I was prepared to write his eulogy, had even asked a friend for examples of eulogies she had written to use as a basis, because I had never written one before. My sister and I had agreed we would deliver it together, every other\u00a0paragraph, but I would craft the words.\nBut I never wrote the eulogy for his funeral, and the reason is this: my dad was an independent thinker until the end. Take, for example, the only thing of his I took home to California with me from Minnesota. My mom said it was the last purchase he made: a coffee mug that has a list of English words and phrases that, grammatically, are often confused. \u201cYou\u2019re\u201d and \u201cYour,\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re\u201d \u201cTheir\u201d and \u201cThere,\u201d etc. For each word or phrase, the coffee mug provides an explanation of its proper use\u2014but each explanation incorporates the expletive fuck. \n\u201cYou\u2019re = You Fucking Are. Your = Shows Fucking Possession.\u201d\n\u201cCould\u2019ve = Could Fucking Have. Could Of = You\u2019re a Fucking Idiot.\u201d\nI took the coffee mug because my dad, like lots of fathers, had sayings he would use over and over again. The world is just a bunch of assholes and idiots, was one of his favorites. Don\u2019t take any wooden nickels, another expression of his general distrust in humanity. But a lot of them were also grammar-related, because my dad, like his dad, had a deep love of English, and he took any accidental misuse of it not only as an assault against language as an institution, but also as some kind of personal insult. Thus, as a child, if I finished my dinner and announced, I\u2019m done! my dad would clear my plate and reply, Cakes are \u2018done,\u2019 people are \u2018finished.\u2019 A lesson in superlatives was squeezed into a rhyme that I hope to someday cross-stitch onto a pillow: Good better best, never let it rest\u2014until your good is better, and your better is best. If I ever used a word incorrectly, my dad would let me know immediately, and tell me to Go look it up in your Funk & Wagnall\u2019s. And if in a fit of teenage rage I ever said, YOU\u2019RE the one that\u2019s being unfair! he surely would have replied, who\u2019s.\nThat coffee mug is sarcastic, hilarious, smart and irreverent, just like my dad. And it\u2019s completely fitting that it\u2019s the last purchase he ever made. This is the man whose last email to the family from his deathbed was not to express remorse or love or final wishes\u2014but to complain about Trump. trump thinks Jackson would have prevented the civil war, per a CNN report tonight. Don\u2019t know trump\u2019s point on that. going off the deep end, he is. And the entire reason why I never delivered his eulogy was because he never had a funeral\u2014he expressly told my mother and my aunt that he did not want one.\nHalf of the reason he never had a funeral was because he had his body donated to science, which I find incredibly cool. The other half is because around the age of sixty-three, my dad stopped believing in God. After growing up the son of an Episcopalian reverend, as an altar boy in an Episcopalian church, and living his adulthood as the brother of an Episcopalian reverend\u2014believing in the Bible and practicing the golden rule his entire life\u2014my dad decided in his twilight years that it was bogus. I talked to him pretty extensively about it, because where most people would seek comfort in religion at his age, my dad rejected any promise of an afterlife, because it stopped making sense to him.\u00a0\u00a0 After years of struggles, he no longer saw any evidence that Jesus was looking out for him, and rather than dig his heels into the dirt and insist that Episcopalism was going to save him someday, he simply changed his mind.\nI saw his flexibility of heart at another very poignant moment between the two of us. He was so proud when, as a grad student at Chico State, I was hired to teach freshman composition, a class where first-year students are taught how to write academic papers. He assumed his progeny was going to make sure that teenagers in California would know that cakes are \u2018done,\u2019 people are \u2018finished.\u2019 And in a heartbreaking conversation, I had to explain to my dad that grammar is no longer taught to first-year college students.\nThen how do they learn to WRITE? he asked incredulously.\nI described how we are taught to edit their papers for organization and clarity, how forming an argument and supporting it with facts is top priority. But if we see grammar that is not prescriptive, we are not supposed to alter it unless it\u2019s unclear writing.\n\u201cPrescriptive\u201d? he asked.\n\u201cProper English,\u201d I said. For example, a student growing up in a household where both English and Spanish are spoken likely uses a form of English that old-school grammarians wouldn\u2019t consider \u201ccorrect,\u201d but as instructors we honor whatever language they use, as long as their ideas are clear.\nAnd you agree with this?\nI didn\u2019t at first, but now I do. My dad sighed. It took a few more conversations, but in the end, he actually came around. He was able to accept that his ideas of language\u2014concepts that to him were literally more holy than religion\u2014were changing, and he was willing to change with them.\nThis is what I mean when I say that my dad was an independent thinker until the end. I hope, if I have learned anything from him, it\u2019s how to be a cork in the stream, to bend and not break, to be elastic in my ideas forever, and to keep a sense of humor through it all. Because there is a vital difference between losing, and being loose.  Or, as his coffee cup will remind us:\n\u201cLose = Cease to Fucking Keep. Loose = Not Fucking Fixed in Place.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWritten by Marta Shaffer (with unwavering help from Jenna Roebuck)\n\n\n \n\nJanuary 22, 2018watershedcsuc\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n2017 Pushcart Prize\u00a0Nominations \n\n\n\nWatershed Review is pleased to announce our nominations for the 2017 Pushcart Prize\u00a0 Anthology.

Rob will be reading from his newest publication Spectators: Flash Fictions (Five Oaks Press, 2017). Kirkus Reviews has praised Spectators as \u201cA small but mighty collection of textual snapshots\u2026 Flash fiction at its best that\u2019s definitely worth a look.\u201d Indeed, the collection of micro wonders has been nominated for Pulitzer Prize.\nRob talks about his writing process for Spectators in The Story Prize. The collection was inspired by photography and visual art of Stephani Schaefer, Sara G. Umemoto, and Tom Patton. He started off with ekphrastic exercises, simply literary responses to artistic production before trimming each piece down. This process, as I recalled Rob saying at his first reading at Arabica Caf\u00e9 downtown Chico, allowed him to realize what was essential. By compacting each piece to less than a page, truly, each word is important and every line shines.\nThis work moves from the lyrical to the narrative and to the meta, reminding us that, just like memories, we may not remember moments in their entirety. We remember only certain instances or details. Rob expertly draws out those kinds of details to ground us in familiarity, something different, and gifts us with something we had not quite noticed before. After all, \u201cWe are spectators\u2026We exist both to observe and be observed.\u201d\nDavidson\u2019s previous story collections are The Farther Shore (Bear Star, 2012) and Field Observations (Missouri, 2001). He is also the author of a monograph, The Master and the Dean: The Literary Criticism of Henry James and William Dean Howells (Missouri, 2005). His fiction, essays and interviews have appeared in Zyzzyva, Hayden\u2019s Ferry Review, Indiana Review, New Delta Review, South Dakota Review, and elsewhere. Davidson\u2019s honors include a Fulbright U.S. Senior Scholar award to lecture in Taiwan (2015-2016), the Camber Press fiction award, judged by Ron Carlson, and an AWP Intro Journals Project Award in fiction.\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Rob Davidson, this Thursday at 7:30 pm Colusa 100B.

Williams on Thursday, April 6th.\nWe are proud to host a reading of Williams\u2019 debut novel, Landfalls. A captivating integration of fiction and history, Landfalls tells the story of the star-crossed expeditions of the French ships Boussole and Astrolabe in 1785. Told through the perspectives of sailors, native peoples, family members, and many others, the ships\u2019 journeys give an imagined voice to a little known history.\nA native of Japan, Naomi Williams spoke no English until she was six years old. Her writing has been featured in Zoetrope: All-Story,\u00a0A Public Space,\u00a0One Story, The Southern Review, The Gettysburg Review and even earned her a Pushcart Prize. Williams holds a MA in creative writing from UC Davis, where she now teaches. As well, she serves as co-director of the literary series\u00a0Stories on Stage Davis. Landfalls has been long-listed for the Center for Fiction First Novel Prize and the National Book Critics Circle\u2019s John Leonard Award.\nWhen asked what inspired Landfalls, Williams tells interviewers that the idea came from an old map of the Lap\u00e9rouse expedition given to her by her husband. This stirred her idea for a multi-narrative collection of stories that would build the expedition from \u201cvoices we don\u2019t usually hear.\u201d Williams writes extensively of the map and how it inspired her on her blog.\nWilliams\u2019 debut work has been praised for her research and historical accuracy. She challenged herself to veer from the historical narrative as little a possible and found creative inspiration in the historical accounts. It is no doubt she is a lover of history and it shows through her profound retelling of the Lap\u00e9rouse expedition.\nReading Landfalls will reopen your eyes to history and leave you wondering how your favorite historical figures, and the people around them, felt at crucial points in the past, or pondering what inspired them to do what they did. Williams\u2019 own exploratory instinct links her and her historical characters in Landfalls. Her wonder-filled story may awaken your own investigative impulse and guide your future reading experience. Williams is currently hard at work on several writing projects, including a novel based on the early 20th-century Japanese poet Yosano Akiko.\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Naomi J. Williams, Thursday at 7:30 pm in the Zingg Recital Hall (ARTS 150). Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, Writer\u2019s Voice readings are free and open to the public.\nBy Kennedi Turner\nRead an Excerpt and Interview \nRead a New York Times Book Review\n\n\nApril 5, 2017watershedcsuc\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nWriter\u2019s Voice Spotlight: Robert\u00a0Krut \n\n\nI recently had the pleasure of reading Robert Krut\u2019s poetry for the first time. The experience was both enlightening and inspiring. Krut\u2019s writing conveys feelings that are familiar and yet somehow indiscernible. Images speak, melting into emotions that cannot be articulated, kindling the smolder of latent imagination.\nJust one of the many themes present in Krut\u2019s poetry I found particularly fascinating was the supernatural elements, and I found myself spellbound by his use of imagery. There were moments of surprise in Krut\u2019s poetry in which I had to stop and ask myself \u201cDid this seemingly regular imagery really just take that turn?\u201d\nHere are five of my favorites:\n\u201cGargoyle\u201d and \u201cYou are a Jellyfish, Ghost,\u201d\u00a0(Packingtown Review)\n\u201cHold Me, the Walls are Falling,\u201d\u00a0(Vinyl Poetry, with an accompanying video)\n\u201cHeart Holds Lake,\u201d (A Dozen Nothing)\n\u201cPhantasmagoria at Six AM,\u201d (Night Block)\nIn preparation for his upcoming visit, I was lucky enough to ask Robert Krut about his writing process and creative life:\nWhat kind of creative patterns, routines, or rituals do you have?\nI just try to write whenever a phrase or image jumps out at me\u2014sometimes that happens at a time when I can type it right out, sometimes it is written into a bedside notebook, sometimes it means recording cryptic words into my phone. Then, later I can pull them all together for the actual writing. In terms of routine, that changes up periodically\u2014for a while I will only write at the crack of dawn, which will prove to be very productive. Then, I\u2019ll mix it up and write at the end of the day, when my inhibitions are down a bit. The key, as everyone will say, is to try to write every day whether it is crafting a full-blown draft or even just a few lines.\nI will say the most productive I am is when I have a schedule to stick to\u2014and why I don\u2019t manage to always stick to it is a great mystery of either a busy life or laziness\u2014but when I do, I write a lot more. Wake up, write for a while before coffee in the morning. That helps. When I\u2019ve given myself a strict regimen, I always wind up with workable material in the long run.\nThis year you were A Dozen Nothing\u2019s selected poet for March. One of the poems published in that issue was\u00a0Bomb the Subtext. What about this poem is special to you or led you to write it?\nI had been working on a long, long\u2014ridiculously long\u2014poem, designed to be something of an epic piece (in my mind) of interlocking sections with a driving narrative. But the farther I got into it, even mapping out the trajectory of a plot and setting details, it felt less like poetry to me and more like something else. And not something I thought was heading in a particularly interesting direction\u2014it had started with a burst of excitement, but by the end point, it felt stale. So I scrapped the whole plan, and then just tried writing a few poems that would be moments in what had been my initially exciting world for the piece. About four short poems made it out of that process\u2014\u201cBomb the Subtext\u201d was one of them. My hope is that those remaining poems evoke the larger \u201cstory\u201d or \u201cthemes\u201d or whatever else it might be called better than where the longer piece was headed.\nIn terms of what makes it special, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything special about the poem itself, but I am glad that it appeared in A Dozen Nothing, which is such a great new journal. Pete Miller and Jeff Sirkin\u2014both incredible poets themselves\u2014are really onto something there, and I was thrilled to be a part of it.\nWhat was your biggest mistake as a writer?\nWhen I was younger (not to jump the gun on your next question), it was thinking that I had to pick one particular style or approach and stick with it, which can shut you off to trying new things. I write like this, and not like that, or (worse), this is the way it should be done, etc. That lets you get boring very quickly.\nThese days, if I\u2019m not reading as much as a I want\u2014as much as I should\u2014I feel that mistake in both my daily life and, of course, my writing.\nIf you could go back in time, what would you tell your younger writer self?\nTalk half as much, and listen twice as much.\nWhat is a measure of success for a poet?\nI\u2019m not sure how to define success, really, but personally I feel (temporary) satisfaction when I\u2019ve been editing and revising a draft of a poem for a while and then get to the point where I feel safe enough to walk away from it. As I just wrote that sentence, I was reminded of one of your Chico State alumni, in fact\u2014Raymond Carver\u2014who wrote about a similar feeling in his piece \u201cOn Writing.\u201d I read that essay religiously when I was younger, and it clearly stuck. There is always a little blink of time after letting the poem set in place that feels rewarding, and then you get back to work.\n______________________________\nRobert Krut is the author of\u00a0This is the Ocean\u00a0(Bona Fide Books, 2013),which received the Melissa Lanitis Gregory Poetry Award, as well as\u00a0The Spider Sermons\u00a0(BlazeVox, 2009).\u00a0His work has appeared widely in print and online, in journals like\u00a0Cimarron Review,\u00a0Blackbird,\u00a0Smartish Pace,\u00a0and more.\u00a0In 2007,\u00a0H_NGM_N\u00a0released his chapbook\u00a0Theory of the Walking Big Bang;\u00a0subsequently, he began serving on the press/journal\u2019s Editorial Board.\u00a0He teaches at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and lives in Los Angeles.\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Robert Krut, Tuesday, November 29th at 7:30 pm in Colusa 100A.

The memoir consists of a collection of essays, with topics ranging from alcoholism, poverty, fashion, queer culture in the 90s, and sex. As is mentioned in Kazim Ali\u2019s essay \u201cGenre-Queer: Notes Against Generic Binaries,\u201d people are looking to break down the expectations that might be imposed on a body of work just as they would be on a person. Tea adds her own color to this discussion with her genre-bending novel Black Wave, blending elements of a memoir into a fictional universe, and with the novel-turned-film, Valencia, which became a collaborative effort with 21 different directors whose unique vision led to a sold-out premiere at the Castro Theater in San Francisco.\nIn the first chapter of How to Grow Up, Tea identifies herself with a persimmon tree due to its unsynchronized flare of life:\u201cAs all the other trees lose their leaves and begin their winter dying, the persimmon flares up brighter than any of them have ever been, bearing fruit, even. That was me. I wasn\u2019t on the same timetable as the other trees in the garden, but I was alive, coming into a certain prime, even.\u201d\nTea associates this image of the persimmon\u2019s belated blooming with a positive note that is sustained throughout the memoir. Although she often approaches her past self with humility and insight, she never apologizes for being different and even dedicates a chapter to \u201cYoung Michelle.\u201d In this chapter, she simultaneously ridicules and adores Young Michelle (velvet body suit and all), but never placed her in a box. This strain of self-love, almost edging on maternal, resonated with me and came off as deeply unique. Having been raised working class in Chelsea, Massachusetts, she is able to contextualize her actions in a way that brings her readers together, despite the sometimes obscure events in her life, such as living in a house where none of the roommates cleaned. Ever. Seeing that I am the type of person who saves old toothbrushes in order to scrub the grout lines along the tile floor, I was horrified.\nThis image of the persimmon tree is subtly repeated when her sobriety acts as a conduit for moving in with partying twenty-year-olds and again when her \u201cbiological time clock\u201d begins tolling with the desire to experience pregnancy. These situations play at readers\u2019 expectations of recovery and of their own understanding of when milestones should occur.\nMichelle Tea is a memoirist, poet, editor, founder of the online publication Mutha magazine and the non-profit organization RADAR Productions, and a literary citizen, having dedicated a portion of her career to creating opportunities for queer writers, such as Sister Spit. She has also written for multiple blogs and magazine, including xojane, where she documented her experiences with pregnancy. A particular favorite of mine was called, \u201cGetting Pregnant With Michelle: I had a Baby.\u201d\nButte College, Butte College\u2019s Diversity Committee and the 1078 Literary Committee are proud to welcome Michelle Tea to the 1078 Gallery (820 Broadway) on October 11th, 7:30 pm.\nWritten by Samantha Smith\n\n\nOctober 10, 2016watershedcsuc 1078 gallery, Butte College, diversity, michelle tea\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nWriter\u2019s Voice Spotlight: Martha\u00a0Collins \n\n\nIn her introduction to Writing White, Martha Collins states, \u201cI think we go a long way toward understanding why white poets don\u2019t address racial issues more often when we acknowledge that it\u2019s almost impossible for poets of color not to write from a racialized experience.\u201d\nBorn in Omaha, Nebraska, Collins grew up with a keen understanding of censorship with her writing. In an interview with Michael Simms for Coal Hill Review in 2012, Collins stated that she \u201clearned that I\u2019m usually onto something when I hear the censor\u2019s voice.\u201d It is Collins\u2019 ability to push past the mental censorship that was developed deep within her from parents and teachers, critics and society that has made her so successful as a writer who understands what it means to \u201cwrite white.\u201d\nMy first taste of Martha Collins came subtly, in the form of a book called Blue Front, a book of poems that took me by surprise. What unfolded in front of me was not \u201cjust a book of poems\u201d but a fantastic artistic move in which Collins uses poetry to tell a story unlike any I have ever read. Collins brings us into a scene that is both horrific and raw and adds to it a reality that we often try not to talk about. She does not balk in the face of censorship, but instead, looks it right in the eye and says what she means to say and does so eloquently and passionately.\nWhat Collins does is, as Chico State Creative Writing professor Jeanne Clark states, \u201cengages questions of race in utterly harrowing, necessary and compelling ways.\u201d A great example of her ability to \u201cengage questions of race\u201d can be seen in her book-length poem Blue Front (Graywolf, 2006) where Collins uses white space, historiography, fragmentation and interpretation to describe a lynching her father witnessed when he was only 5 years old. Her father was known for selling fruit in front of the Blue Front Restaurant in Cairo, Illinois, the town in which the lynching took place. The poems create a feeling of frenzy, chaos, hurriedness, and violence. It is done both simply and stunningly, pushing the limits of poetry by using evidence of postcard descriptions, the legal history of the event, and even Collins\u2019 own speculation of what happened.\nCollins\u2019 ability to push censorship and art comes together in her work in a cohesive and deliberate form. In her poem \u201cWhite Papers\u201d she gives a stunning account of the issue of race with simple but raw statements like, \u201cBecause my father said yes/ but not in our lifetimes\u201d and \u201cBecause among the crayons/ there was one called Flesh.\u201d Her use of anaphora brings to light the arguments that have taken place for generations. Her use of language recreates the ways in which we have talked about race in the past and even what we may still talk about it in the future.\nWith three Pushcart Prizes, the Alice Fay Di Castagnola Award, a Lannan residency grant, the Laurence Goldstein Poetry Prize and many fellowships, it is hard to deny Collins dedication to her craft and importance as an American poet. Her most recent book, Admit one: An American Scrapbook (Pittsburgh, 2016) has been praised by Writer\u2019s Chronicle for poetry that is stated to be \u201cpoised at the juncture between the lyric and ethics.\u201d Her other works include Day Unto Day\u00a0(Milkweed, 2014) and White Papers (Pitt Poetry Series, 2012). After attending Stanford University for her B.A. and then the University of Iowa for her Ph.D., Collins taught at the University of Massachusetts Boston where she founded the Creative Writing Program and for ten years was Pauline Delaney Professor of Creative Writing at Oberlin College, and is also editor-at-large for FIELD magazine.\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Martha Collins, Tuesday at 7:30 pm in Colusa 100B.
