The initiative held two events in March \u2013 including the first of a speaker series, with investment banking and sustainability expert Cynthia Wang \u2013 and is planning a summit and the unveiling of an index in fall.\nKoepp sent his first monthly newsletter in March, cowrote a piece for the Orange County Business Journal and is making video commentaries on current issues, mostly recently about TikTok.\nThe new initiative may invite the question \u2013 why another thought center on Asia?\nKoepp says centers at other universities focus on either international relations or culture.\n\u201cWe\u2019re unique, and the only center that has the combination of geopolitics, economics and business,\u201d says Koepp, adding that many other centers only focus on a part of Asia.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at it as Asia-Pacific, meaning that it includes the United States and other Pacific-facing economies,\u201d he says.\nThat includes an emphasis on California and Orange County.\n\u201cWe\u2019re part of the Asia-Pacific community,\u201d Argyros Dean Henrik Cronqvist said at Wang\u2019s talk in March. \u201cYou think it\u2019s over there, but it\u2019s also here literally because of the inflow of immigration into Orange County. Many businesses in our area have close ties to Asia \u2026 that is part of the world that is the closest to us from a business perspective, from an economics perspective. So that\u2019s why we have this initiative.\u201d\nWang said the point of such an initiative is also \u201cto encourage more intellectual and practical partnerships.\u201d\nExperience in Asia\nKoepp brings experience on both fronts. He was chief economist and senior editor for The Economist Corporate Network in Hong Kong, Asian representative for Marvel Entertainment and a communications adviser to China- and Japan-based companies listed on U.S. stock markets. He has lived in Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, China and Hong Kong.\nKoepp was in Hong Kong in 2019 during the pro-democracy protests preceding the Chinese government\u2019s introduction of a new national security law. The 2020 law gave Beijing more power to restrict civil liberties in the global commercial hub.\n\u201cIt was very hard, because I always tried to be cognizant of my role as someone from outside the countries I\u2019ve lived in,\u201d he says. \u201cI was always respectful but personally sympathetic to any cause for free expression and personal autonomy. So in that sense I was very much against what the Chinese government was trying to do to the people of Hong Kong but also appreciated that it is a complex issue.\u201d\nAt the same time, he was on the ground.\n\u201cI definitely have inside understanding and can relate to things that way as someone who\u2019s lived there and been part of society,\u201d he says.\nAlthough he was initially drawn to Asian culture, he learned that it\u2019s intertwined with business.\n\u201cFor example, in China one of the earlier dynasties uses the term \u201cshang\u201d that has come to stand for commercialism,\u201d he says. \u201cAlso, if you look at its literature, they have classical works that talk about commerce, and how to manage commerce and its importance to Chinese society and politics.\u201d\nOne way the institute can contribute to the Asia-Pacific discussion is weighing in on current events, like China-Taiwan tensions, he says.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just looking at things abstractly from an economic standpoint,\u201d he says. \u201cWe also look at what it means for businesses that are active in the value chain, and what their strategies need to be, and how do they react to these situations?\u201d\nCloser to home, Koepp notes that Irvine recently became the newest U.S. city with a relative majority Asian population.\n\u201cNow, these populations and businesses from here are interacting with the rest of the Asia-Pacific region,\u201d Koepp says. \u201cIt\u2019s very integrated. Our initiative also looks at things that way. We emphasize Orange County, but we also look beyond Orange County and even beyond Southern California.\u201d\nThe initiative recognizes the way people and economies are connected globally.\n\u201cEven if you aren\u2019t traveling anymore, you can use video communications and other platforms to virtually conduct business with Asia,\u201d he says. \u201cIf anything, modern technology brings diverse corners of the globe closer together, making it more important to understand an area like Asia.\u201d\n\n\nArgyros School Argyros School of Business and Economics Asia Asia-Pacific Asia-Pacific Geoeconomics and Business Initiative Asia-Pacific initiative business economics Hong Kong Pacific Taiwan TikTok \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJoy Juedes \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Canogar\u2019s \u201cPareidolia\u201d Multimedia Artwork Unveiled at Chapman University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Canogar\u2019s \u201cPareidolia\u201d Multimedia Artwork Unveiled at Chapman University On April 13, the Phyllis and Ross Escalette Permanent Collection of Art in Wilkinson College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences unveiled its newest artwork installation, \u201cPareidolia,\u201d by internationally renowned...\n\n\nApril 27, 2023 Staci Dumoski\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgyros School Climbs to No. 60 Chapman University\u2019s Argyros School of Business and Economics rose to No. 60 in the new Best Business School rankings by U.S. News & World Report.
