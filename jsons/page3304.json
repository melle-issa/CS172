The protection against discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation includes sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, and gender based dating and domestic violence and stalking.\nAny person may report sex discrimination, including sexual harassment (whether or not the person reporting is the person alleged to have experienced the conduct that could constitute sex discrimination or sexual harassment), inperson, by mail, by telephone, or by electronic mail, using the contact information listed below for the Title IX Coordinator, or by any other means that results in the Title IX Coordinator receiving the person\u2019s verbal or written report. Such a report may be made at any time (including during non-business hours) by using the telephone number or electronic mail address, or by mail to the office address, listed for the Title IX Coordinator.\nThe following person has been designated to handle inquiries regarding the non-discrimination Policies and Title IX complaints for Cal State Fullerton:\nSarah BauerTitle IX Coordinator2600 Nutwood Ave Suite 205Fullerton, CA 92831\nsarahbauer@fullerton.edu\n(657) 278-2929\nhttps://www.fullerton.edu/titleix/\n\nQuestions may also be addressed to:\nOffice for Civil RightsSan Francisco OfficeU.S. Department of Education50 United Nations PlazaSan Francisco, CA 94102Telephone: (415) 486-5555Facsimile: (415) 486-5570Email: OCR.SanFrancisco@ed.gov\n\n\u00a0\n\nA PDF version of this notice can be downloaded here\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site is maintained by \n\t\t\t\t\t\tTitle IX and Gender Equity.\nLast Published 3/30/23\nTo report problems or comments with this site, please contact \n\t\t\t\t\t\ttitleix@fullerton.edu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 California State University, Fullerton.
