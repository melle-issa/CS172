You will see, for example, programs aimed at helping to improve teaching skills\u00a0as well as\u00a0programs to help with writing skills.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOur faculty also exhibits this commitment to the professional development of our students.\u00a0UC Riverside has always been known for the quality of its teaching and the accessibility of its faculty.\u202fThe campus prides itself on the close collegial relations between graduate students and their mentors.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUCR's faculty strive to provide our graduate students with\u00a0rigorous\u00a0academic training and instruction\u00a0in the best professional practices\u00a0to\u00a0equip them in every way for success in their careers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the past few years, UC Riverside has hired many new, outstanding faculty, increased the number and size of the graduate programs, established new programs, and invested in new research. While continuing to emphasize our already world-renowned programs, we are also working innovatively across disciplinary boundaries. UCR's programs are well known for their\u00a0quality of research and\u00a0for\u00a0their creative\u00a0and innovative approaches to their subject matter.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhatever your chosen discipline, UC Riverside is an exciting and intellectually stimulating place to be. And, as the most diverse campus in the UC system, it has a deserved reputation for being open and welcoming as we prepare our students for the global 21st century. \n\u00a0\nShaun Bowler\nDean of the Graduate Division\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion    \n\n            Students are drawn to UCR because our graduate population is more diverse than most, because they want to work with our diverse undergraduate population, and because they will be mentored by faculty members who are committed to diversity and inclusion and who identify as belonging to a group that is underrepresented in their fields.    \n\nStatement of Solidarity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                \n            23    \n            \n\n                \n            Interdisciplinary Research Centers    \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n            55    \n            \n\n                \n            Master's Programs    \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n                \n            42    \n            \n\n                \n            Doctoral Programs    \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents Say...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUC Riverside not only holds the most diverse student body of any University of California, which created a diverse and friendly atmosphere that enabled me to thrive as a first generation and migrant scholar.
