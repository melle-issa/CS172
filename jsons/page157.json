Struppa welcomed representatives from 100 organizations to the 2023 State of the University address, honoring them for their status as \u201cTop Employers\u201d and thanking them for their continuing commitment to \u201cThink Chapman First.\u201d\n\u201cI want to thank all of the [organizations] that work with us. They are so important to our success. They provide internships. They provide jobs to our students. They work with us to help us better understand the kind of curriculum we need to develop,\u201d said Struppa. \u201cYour role in the [university] is crucial. The university can\u2019t succeed without these kinds of partnerships.\u201d\nRepresenting a diverse range of industries from across the country, Chapman\u2019s Top Employers are honored each year for the strength of their partnerships with the university, through their consistent, active participation in recruiting efforts as well as hiring a notable percentage of Chapman graduates for their workforce. Included among the organizations honored were international giants such as Experian, Netflix and Walmart, as well as local mainstays such as Edwards Lifesciences, CHOC and the City of Orange.\u00a0\n>> See the complete list of 2023 Top Employers.\u00a0\nA special reception for Top Employers was held following the State of the University address, where Jennifer Kim, assistant vice president of Career and Professional Development at Chapman, thanked those present once again.\n\u201cAs a Top Employer, you can attest to the distinction that comes with a Chapman University degree,\u201d said Kim. \u201cOur students not only receive an excellent education, but they graduate ready to launch impactful careers. Chapman Panthers are critical thinkers, team players, hardworking and loyal. They possess a combination of hard and soft skills that will make them tremendous assets at your organizations.\u201d\nChapman Grads Praised as \u201cBest Talent Nationally\u201d\n\n\u201cChapman University is producing some of the highest and best talent nationally,\u201d says Alex Hayden, vice chairman of CBRE, one of the organizations honored. CBRE, the world\u2019s largest commercial real estate company, continually looks to Chapman as a source for quality young professionals, says Hayden.\n\u00a0Tim Rahall, a partner at EY, one of the \u201cbig four\u201d accounting firms, agrees. \u201cChapman students represent the best and brightest business and accounting students in Southern California.\u201d\nWith more than 20 current students and alumni at their boutique law firm, Berger Kahn says that they choose to Think Chapman First\u00a0 \u201cbecause [Chapman] students are academically highly qualified, with a strong sense of practicality. They are ready to be achievers from day one.\u201d\n\u201cThe talent that comes out of Chapman University has been a powerful driver of our growth and success in the marketplace,\u201d says Kelly Vlahakis-Hanks (EMBA \u201916), president and CEO of ECOS Earth Friendly Products. A Chapman alumna herself, Vlahakis-Hanks says that ECOS always looks first to Chapman in their hiring process. \n\u201cEach one of the alumni we\u2019ve hired has had a positive impact on our mission to protect the health and wellness of people, pets and the planet,\u201d she says.\nPaving the Way to a Stronger Workforce\nChapman Top Employers don\u2019t just hire graduates: their partnerships often include internship programs that help prepare students for the workplace.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are proud to support Chapman students by providing hands-on experience in STEM fields that will not only benefit the student, but also benefit our community partner organizations,\u201d says Tim Seidel, general manager of Phillips 66.\n\u201cJoining forces allows us to help shape the next generation of pharmacy professionals and advance healthcare in our communities,\u201d agrees Janet Govea, university relations manager for CVS Health.\nChapman Students are Prepared to Change the World\nChapman graduates are in demand in the arts and non-profit sectors, too.\u00a0\n\u201cChapman students are change makers,\u201d says senior recruiter Sakeena Ali of the Peace Corps, one of the many non-profit organizations that have repeatedly sought out Chapman alumni.\n\u201cChapman University\u2019s graduates bring evolved thought, superior educational background and a modern skill set to the Orange County workforce and beyond,\u201d says Robin Follman, campaign director and director of vocal programs at Orange County Music and Dance. Follman also serves as Secretary on Chapman\u2019s Board of Governors, as well as a member of the Argyros School of Business and Economics Board of Counselors.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIt is our responsibility to assist these talented individuals as they cross into the professional world so that they can utilize their insights and skills in creating a brighter and more tolerant world for future generations,\u201d says Follman.\u00a0\nChapman alumna Carrie Nocella \u201999, director of external affairs for Disneyland Resort, proudly serves on the university\u2019s Board of Governors, as well.\nIn response to celebrating The Walt Disney Company\u2019s fifth consecutive year as a Top Employer of Chapman talent, Nocella shared, \u201cThe Walt Disney Company is proud to be included in Chapman University\u2019s Top Employers. Chapman University is one of many higher education institutions just miles from Disneyland Resort that enrolls many of our employees. In addition, Disney also employs a large number of Chapman University alumni. There\u2019s magic in learning, and we\u2019re proud to have partners like Chapman University!\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nSee the full list of 2023\u2019s Top Employers and find out how your organization will benefit when you Think Chapman First. \n\n\nChapman Top Employer 2023: Ingram MicroGreg Hauser Vice, President, Talent Acquisition; Christina Higgins, Professional, Talent Acquisition + Learning & DevelopmentChapman Top Employer 2023: DeloitteSean Peasley, Partner; John Sadoff, Managing DirectorChapman Top Employer 2023: Green StreetReagan Berkley, Regional Talent OfficerChapman Top Employer 2023: Rutan & TuckerKenneth Zielinski, PartnerChapman Top Employer 2023: Pacific SymphonyAbby Edmunds, Director of Volunteer Services; Jayee Liu Human, Resources ManagerChapman Top Employer 2023: Berger KahnTyler Angelini, Hannah Hong, Erin Mindoro EzraChapman Top Employer 2023: E. & J.
