(19 April)\nv 15.6.1\nv. 15.6.2\n\n\n\nNote: The version tag of the Gutenberg Nightly will always be on decimal ahead of the stable. So version 10.3 is in the works, the nightly version will be 10.4.

One of the quickest ways to get started doing alpha/beta testing is to install the Gutenberg Nightly plugin, which pulls in the latest build from the Gutenberg project. Ordinarily, to get the latest build one would have to install NodeJS and npm and use the command line to get set up. This process can be prohibitive, along with the dizzying pace of Gutenberg development, for less technical users who want to start testing. \n\n\nGutenberg: How to test the latest updates\nOn GoDaddyPro Online, I had the pleasure of joining Andy Fragen and George Mamadashvili and Courtney Robertson and talk about the many ways you can test WordPress and Gutenberg. \nI talked and demo\u2019d the process on getting the Gutenberg Nightly and how to update it. You can watch the recording of the full show on YouTube \nCourtney Robertson wrote: \u201cGutenberg Nightlies\u00a0\u2014 If you\u2019d like to combine the Gutenberg plugin to test the most current version of the Gutenberg plugin, follow these tips from Birgit to get the latest version\u201d\n\n\nProject Updates \nFebruary 7, 2023 \u2013 The latest Git Updater 12.1.0 makes the update work well again. \nFebruary 5, 2023 \u2013 Error message: Update failed: The source and destination are the same seems to be rooted in the Core Nightly or the Git Updater plugin. Andy Fragen has a fix in the Git Updater develop branch. Use Allow branch switching setting to test the fix. \nJan 29, 2023 Updated: All is right again, with Git Updates 12.04. Thank  you Andy. Jan 27, 2023 Note: Over the last week, we encountered download errors with Git Updater 12.0.3 \u2013 Reverting to 12.0.1 and Gutenberg Nightly updates without any issues. For convenience purposes, you can download the Git Updater version 12.0.1  here. (bph 01/27/2023)\nApril 21, 2022 \u2013 Goofed the first run of the Gutenberg Nightly because I was distracted and missed a step. For the second build to work and update via the Git Updater, I needed to do another version bump. The correct version is v-13.2.20220422\nMarch 18th, 2022 \u2013 Jamie Marsland, PootlePress uses the Gutenberg Nightly for trainings sites via TasteWP, he offers to his YouTube subscribers to test new features or themes with the latest Gutenberg changes. Marsland also published free Gutenberg tutorials on his website.\nMarch 3rd, 2022 \u2013 It seems to be working well for people. Sometimes WP Tavern links to it, like in this article: The WordPress Web Fonts API Has Arrived, when there is a feature already merged into the repo, but will only come in a future release. We crossed 114,000 downloads. \nDecember 8th, 2021 \u2013 After the new version of GitUpdater 10.6.7 updating the Gutenberg nightly assets works consistently again. Again, Huge Thanks to Andy Fragen, you help troubleshooting this and finding a solution. \nDecember 7th, 2021 \u2013 Andy Fragen has figured out why some sites wouldn\u2019t update and is about to release a new version of the GitUpdater. \nDecember 6th, 2021 \u2013 Testing it again from SiteGround still that Bad Request error. I used it on the LocalWP instance and I successfully updated 20211203 to 20211206 version. I have no idea what the problem is. \nConnected with Andy on the WPSlack, and he \nDecember 4th, 2021 The update with GitUpdater has worked for the last two days. At my reference test site on SiteGround, I only get the message:  Updated failed: Download failed. Bad Request.\n\nTesting it again on a different site on Digital Ocean, and it worked well. \nNovember 24th, 2021 \u2013 Gutenberg Nightly just passed 100,000 downloads. \n\nNovember 22, 2021 \u2013 We just passed 99,000 downloads! Over the weekend I was successful to replicate the process, I had on my private computer on my company computer now. It\u2019s major as the build process is now down to one minute! \nOctober 20, 2021 \u2013 We just passed the 90,000 download thresholds. \nJuly 17th, 2021: A couple week\u2019s ago we pass the threshold of 70,000 downloads.  This is quite astonishing, considering the very specific use case for the Gutenberg Nightly. Today, I also updated references from GitHub Update plugin to Git Updater plugins by Andy Fragen. \nJuly 8th, 2021:  I noticed today, that if you deactivated the plugin because you are for instance testing a Beta/RC version of Core, the GitHub Updater doesn\u2019t signal that there is an update available. It only places the \u201cThere is an update available\u201d information on the plugins screen once you activate it again. VS Code lets me deal with merge conflicts by giving me the choices on which code segment to commit. \nMay 10th, 2021: Grzegorz Ziolkowski merged the latest stable code base (10.5) into WordPress Core. If you use the Beta Tester plugin, and set it to the channel \u201cBleeding Edge\u201d and the stream to \u201cNightlies\u201d you can already start testing 5.8 alpha including changes to Gutenberg 9.9 \u2013 10.5. plugin releases.\nMay 6th, 2021. Release candidate for 10.6 is available now\nMay 5th, 2021. Changed the tag number to 10.7., to stay ahead of the 10.6 release cycle. Today, there might be a 10.6 rc release. Fixed the purged link to another plugin\u2019s settings. page. \nApril 28th, 2021. In the WordPress News post \u2013 Curious About Full Site Editing? Gutenberg Nightly was mentioned on as a Resource. 65,000 Downloads, not much movement in the last 10 days. \nApril 19th, 2021. Added link to add a new post to the discussion board to the plugin description of the WP-Admin plugins page. TIL need to use anchor tag, not markdown. \ud83e\udd23\nBefore\nAfter\nApril 18th, 2021. New build. 65,000 downloads. Also published Gutenberg Changelog #42 \nApril 15th, 2021. New build after 63,000 downloads. Added a note about GitHub Updater changes to come and a link to Andy Fragen Sponsor page. \nApril 11th, 2021. 62,000 downloads. Sarah Gooding wrote about it: \u201cWPTavern: Set Up a Gutenberg Test Site in 2 Minutes\u201d. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really valuable service that not many people know about yet.\u201d \nSarah Gooding, editor WPTavern\nJoin the discussion of the article\nApril 10th, 2021. New build today at 61, 000 downloads. \nApril 9th, 2021. After a few days moving and traveling, a new build was created. 60,000 downloads.\nApril 5th, 2021. 58,000 downloads. \nRan into an error regarding chrome driver install.

Also, for the second day in a row, I used git fetch upstream before I auto-merge command. (Turns out I didn\u2019t change the version in gutenberg.php, so it wouldn\u2019t update yet, running a second build. Every time a human is involved it increases the risk of borked-up steps)\nMarch 18th, 2021. Sometimes a build fails on first try the first thing is I  \u201cdelete all node_modules directories\u201d command: rm -rf node_modules packages/*/node_modules\nMarch 14th, 2021. Just added the \u201copen two sites in my browser\u201d task to the distribute-nightly CLI: dist now command. Big thank you to Sindre Sorhus for the open() npm package. \nMarch 10th, 2021. Refactored the distribute-nightly CLI to read the gutenberg.php file to find the version, compare it to WP tag as well as the nightly tag and decide on \u2018new version\u2019 or update asset path. For a while now I have been using dist test to do a dry run of the CLI and could test the logic for various scenarios. I also updated the cli to work with the name change of the default branch to trunk. That switch has been completed through out the process. \nNew merge-command:git merge upstream/trunk -m 'prep build [date]' --no-verify\nNext step for distribute-nightly open two browser windows one for testing  the update in the reference environment, and this page to edit the information. \nWe are at 46,000 downloads. \nFeb 5th, 2021. Wednesday there was a new release of Gutenberg, and this morning they released 10.1.1. I\u2019ll take the time over the weekend to work on my automated distribution script again. Turns out, the new version creation business logic is backwards. The new version needs to look at the gutenberg.php header to find out if a new version needs to be created or not. Comparing the origin and the fork only comes into play to double-check, but the decision falls when changing the version in gutenberg.php before the build. \nOn another good news, Gutenberg Nightly was included a second time in this week in a post on the WPTavern. Today\u2019s post describes all the different User-Friendly Methods for Testing Gutenberg Enhancements and Bug Fixes.\n\u201cGutenberg Times has a page for\u00a0grabbing a nightly-created ZIP\u00a0of the plugin. This includes the latest features and bug fixes that have been merged into the project. For users who want to test the plugin and provide feedback to the development team, this is the easiest way to get started.\u201d Justin Tadlock wrote.\n\n\nWarning: Undefined array key \"master\" in\u00a0/home/customer/www/icodeforapurpose.com/public_html/wp-content/plugins/github-updater/src/GitHub_Updater/Plugin.php\u00a0on line\u00a0453\n\nWhen I scrolled to the plugin list, I saw for the Gutenberg Nightly \u201cAutomatic update is unavailable for this plugin\u201d. \n\nThis is when the GitHub updater\u2019s feature \u201cEnable Branch Switching\u201d would come in.

But did get it finally resolved and another version out. \nAlso learned from Andy Fragen about Shields.io. The GitHub Version of the gb-nightly has been downloaded 35k times. \n\nThis was Riad\u2019s advice: Use node 14 and npm 6 | Remove node_modules folders\u00a0rm -rf node_modules packages/*/node_modules \u2013 That worked. \nRafael suggested npm clean:packages and npm clean:package-types to solve something like this. \n\nFeb \nFebruary 10th, 2021: Same problem. No new release updating the old one. \n\nFebruary 8th, 2021: Ran into some trouble during the build process. The team is working on fixes: #28824 & #28849. I got past it after I downgraded npm install -g npm@6\nAlso, my CLI version check didn\u2019t give me a new release because I botched the new release for 9.9.0. Forgot the 0 so semantic versioning didn\u2019t work. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nJanuary 25th, 2021: modified the plugin build command to NO_CHECKS=true npm run build:plugin-zip` \u2013 to not have the script run through without user interaction. \nMore Tweets \n\nJust released today's build of Gutenberg Nightly a plugin zip from master Gutenberg branch. https://t.co/ZAgPGWC5UV 1/4\u2014 Gutenberg Times (@gutenbergtimes) January 25, 2021\n\n\nJanuary 16th, 2021. The distribute-nightly CLI now includes the SFTP upload of the new build  to this site\u2019s files so the above download link always has the newest version.  \nJanuary 14th, 2021. Today for the first time, the new tag and release was automatically created via the new CLI. I also found out, thanks to Andy Fragen, what cause the bug that prevented GitHub updated to trigger and update. \nJanuary 9th, 2021. Continue to work on distribute-nightly CLI for my workflow, using GitHub CLI and NodeJS. Updated successfully existing release asset via CLI. \nJanuary 4th, 2021. Used GitHub CLI to create the release. \nScreenshot of creating a release via GitHub CLI.\nJust added some data on prompt and added the release comments manually via copy/paste from previous releases. \nDay 71, December 24, 2020. Yay, a Christmas Edition, just because of the date through. Had to fetch from upstream, seems we got out of sync again. \nDay 60, December 13, 2020: New build today. Updates as usual. \nDay 58, December 11, 2020: New build today, getting better at solving merge conflicts. Need to come up with some topics to discuss on the Discussion board. \nDay 57, December 10th, 2020: Earlier today, Gutenberg 9.5.2. was released. Later I build the nightly update. It\u2019s practically the same.  \nDay 56, December 9, 2020.\nNew build today\u00a0on a new tag (9.5.1-nightly). GitHub also offered their new section \u201cDiscussion\u201d and I enabled it for the repository\nAlso, a Thread on Twitter. with four tweets: \n\n\nJust released today\u2019s build of Gutenberg Nightly a plugin zip from master Gutenberg branch. https://gutenbergtimes.com/need-a-zip-from-master/#nightly 1/3\nGutenberg Nightly daily build can up to your wp-admin/plugins page like any other plugin via the GitHub Updated plugin by @andyfragen https://github.com/afragen/github-updater/releases/latest 2/3\nToday, we opened up the GitHub Discussion tab on the repository, in case you have questions or testing ideas or just share how you are using Gutenberg Nightly\nScreenshot how Gutenberg Nightly and GitHub Updater work together to bring updates to your WordPress site.\n\n\nOriginally tweeted by Gutenberg Times (@gutenbergtimes) on December 9, 2020.\n\nDay 54, December 7th, 2020. A couple of days ago, I discovered a thread on GitHub about a plugin zip etc. I suggested GT Nightly to the person seeking help. Here is his answer. \n\nDay 52, December 5th, 2020.  New built today. \nDay 50 \u2013 December 3rd, 2020. That\u2019s a good round number! Merged the updates and created today\u2019s build. Nothing of note, except that I still haven\u2019t gotten any further in automating more of the manual process. \nDay 44, November 27, 2020  \u2013 New build uploaded. \nDay 42, November 25, 2020, New build uploaded. \nLearned that \u201cAnyone who has Gutenberg Nightly installed but not active will see an update to the dot org version. If they update or auto-updates are on, they will need to re-install your version.\u201d \nI also did a typo in the version since the last one. I had a 1 too many in the version number. Now going back to 9.4.1.20201125 makes it look like it\u2019s an older version. \n\nDay 38, November 21, 2020, Yesterday 9.4.1 was released. Today, we have a new built. There were 81 new commit since 9.4.1 was released. The Gutenberg team is fierce!\nNeeded to update npm before the built and merge conflicts sometimes still throw me. \nAlso, fixed some typos, edit instructions for clarity and added a screenshot of the GitHub Update settings page, showing the Refresh Cache button\nDay 36, Nov 19, 2020 \u2013 Brand-new build today. Still semi-manual process. \nDay 33,  Nov 16, 2020 \u2013 I am expecting a 9.4 Release candidate version will come out later today \nDay 27, Nov 10, 2020. Second day in a row, there were no commits to master. \nDay 26, Nov 9, 2020. Updated gb-nightly. Also, tried to create a standard directory on the site, so the new gutenberg.zip can be FTPed to the live Pantheon server. Turns out, the idea was too simple for Pantheon\u2019s set-up. Need to think of something else, then. \n\n\n When I clicked on update, I ran into the following error, which \u2013 as I understood it \u2013 just means the release asset for yesterday\u2019s update isn\u2019t available anymore. \n\nOnce, I refreshed the cache on GitHub Updates Settings, it would display the right version and I was able to update the site. \n\nDay 24, Nov 7, 2020. Updated nightly at 8:00. Anne McCarthy mentioned the Nightly version in here blog post: My setup for the latest & greatest for testing Full Site Editing.\nDay 23, Nov 6, 2020. A new nightly is available. Over the weekend, I\u2019ll start the second phase for the project and try to automate the steps. This PR might give me a headstart.  \nDay 22, Nov 5, 2020. It\u2019s the first day after an official release. 48 commits to master since the 9.3 version was released.  \n\nNovember 4 is the official #Gutenberg 9.3 #release day!You can even download the #Gutenber_Nightly from this link \ud83d\udc49https://t.co/RjE1vqvyYFMassive #ShoutOut to @bph for her work on thought on this project \ud83d\udc4f\u2014 Ahmed Chaion (@chaion07) November 5, 2020\n\nDay 21, Nov 4, 2020 Gutenberg 9.3 was released. Also published a Gutenberg nightly for practice purposes and to see if they update is announced by GitHub Updater since the changes from yesterday. Gotta refresh that Cache! \nProps for this work on WP Slack. \n\n\nUsing the button \u2018Replace current with uploaded\u2019 gets you the Gutenberg Nightly installed. \n\nDay 19, Nov 2, 2020 \u2013 Andy Fragen and I optimized the workflow and will test it Friday Nov 6th, when 9.3 is released. For today and tomorrow, I just link to the RC, Thursday to 9.3 and Friday to our new Gutenberg nightly.  \nTwo parts: \n\nProvide a gutenberg.zip build that has all the proper headers to work with GitHub Updater here \n\nDay 18, Nov 1, 2020 \u2013 Updated Gutenberg-nightly file. Consolidated my local environment and manage a gutenberg fork, to eventually release the nightly via GitHub and GitHub Updater. \nDay 17, Oct 31, 2020 \u2013 Happy Halloween! \ud83d\udc7b \ud83c\udf83 \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc7fNo activity on this page.\nDay 16, Oct, 30, 2020 \u2013 new build ran into quirks because just by uploading the new file, the site created a new file name, which makes it not update the yesterday\u2019s Gutenberg Nightly, but creates a new Gutenberg plugin on your site. Had to delete the previous upload to replace with this. I am working on providing a proper update process for the gutenberg nightly version. \nDay 15, Oct 29, 2020 \u2013 new build now with changed gutenberg.php which makes it a bit more obvious which version of the plugin you have installed. That\u2019s after some testing that my changing the gutenberg.php files wouldn\u2019t mess up the build. \nDay 14, Oct. 28, 2020 \u2013 new build. 90 commits since the 9.2.2 release \nAlso, we had some discussion about this process on Slack in #fse-outreach-experiments, with some great ideas on make this more useable at scale. \nDay 13, Oct 27, 2020 \u2013 new build after Isabel Brison \u201cpublished some npm packages with bug fixes for 5.6 Beta 2\u2033\nFirst time for me to actually review a PR on Gutenberg repo. I followed these instructions.\nGutenberg plugin 9.2.2 was released earlier today, and there were already 58 commits since then\u2026\nWordPress 5.6 Beta 2 was released\nDay 12 Oct 26, 2020 \u2013 built a new version around 11 am. I didn\u2019t see that there was a 9.2.2 release earlier today\u2026 Duh. Also: nosolosw\u00a0released this\u00a03 hours ago\u00a0\u00b7\u00a058 commits\u00a0to master since this release\nDay 10/11 git pull showed a `Already up to date.` message both days (0ct. 24 + 25)\nDay 9, October 23, 2020 \u2013 Didn\u2019t get to create the build until after our recording of the Gutenberg Changelog #31, where I mentioned this page. Andy Fragen released Beta tester plugin version 3.0 today. \nDay 8, October 22, 2020  \u2014 Gutenberg plugin 9.2.1 was released. You can download or update it. \n\nFrom the WordPress repository or \nFrom the GitHub repository\nOr wait until it shows up as an update on your plugins page. \n\nDay 7, October 21, 2020 Gutenberg plugin 9.2 was released. \u2013\nPreparing the 227-item list for our Gutenberg Changelog episode #31 recording on October 23rd. \nMentioned this project during #core-editor meeting.\nDay 6, October 20, 2020 For the next few days I\u2019ll refer the visitors to the Release Candidate and the stable version of the Gutenberg plugin.\nDay 5, October 19, 2020 After got the same message git status message  earlier this morning, although there were 20+ more commits made, I went ahead and created a new build. \n\nIn #core-editor Isabel Brison announced she will create the Gutenberg RC 9.2 early evening my time. \nDay 4, October 18, 2020. I didn\u2019t run a new build as the git status gave me a \u201cYour branch is up to date with \u2018origin/master\u201d message. \nDay 3, October 17, 2020 While I ran today\u2019s build process, I listened to Helen Hou-Sandi on her Twitch channel getting frustrated that there wouldn\u2019t be a download version to alpha-test Gutenberg and where she tried to find one. Glad I can help out. \nDay 2, On October 16, 2020 there was a testing sprint in core for the Widget Screen, and the scrub master added it to the instructions for the test users. \n\nThe first time, I posted the zip-from-master file on October 15, 2020. Very early in the Gutenberg development, I would test things, be very diligent with it to make sure I got the real problem isolated, then I would write up complete issues with steps to reproduce and all the pertinent information to find out that a developer has already fixed it and I should test it again in master to make sure. I wasn\u2019t so keen anymore to do early feature testing. \nTesting WordPress 5.5 betas and release candidate, and a conversation with the developer of the WordPress Beta Plugin got me thinking, again about that situation. I wrote up some ideas on how to provide a plugin zip file from gutenberg master branch and make it available for other testers. \nBig Thanks to Andy Fragen and Anne McCarthy to be a sounding board for my \u201cThis should work like my car\u201d idea. \nQuestions?
