(These programs are officially designated as impacted.) As you get ready to apply to the CSU, learn whether your top choices are impacted, and research alternate choices as needed. If you\u2019re interested in an impacted major or university, be sure to apply for admission during the priority application filing period\u200b\u200b.\u200b\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPTOC\u200bSearch Affected Majors & UniversitiesIf you're a first-time freshman or upper-division transfer student to the CSU, you can use this database to find out whether a degree program or university you're interested in is affected by impaction.\nSearch for a CSU Campus or Major Impaction\u200b\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPTWCO\n\n\nPublishing Top Two Column 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing Top Two Column 3\n\n\nPublishing Top Two Column 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing Top Three Column 1\u200bImpacted Programs MatrixUse this chart to see at a glance which undergraduate programs are and are not affected across the 23-university CSU system. \u200b \n      See the 2023-24\u00a0Matrix (PDF)\n\n\nPublishing Top Three Column 2CSU Local Admission & Service AreasApplying to your local\u00a0Cal State location is always a good idea since students who apply from areas nearest a university are given priority admission.
