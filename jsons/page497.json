They are SDSU Ambassadors, the university\u2019s official student representatives and orientation leaders.\u00a0\u00a0Ambassadors apply for the position and train with the Ambassador staff. They learn to conduct their tours walking backward.\u00a0They also work at campus events, including Explore SDSU, New Student and Family Convocation, Welcome Week, Aztec Nights, Homecoming, Family Weekend, athletic events and Commencement. They\u2019re also involved in extensive community service work with local elementary schools and not-for-profit organizations.\u00a0Francisco Velazquez, director of New Student and Parent Programs, which oversees the Ambassador program, said staff looks for students who display strong leadership qualities, enthusiasm, professionalism, an interest in wanting to get involved and a passion for SDSU, as well as a diverse group of students.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As one of the first official campus representatives to connect with new students and their families, the 80-100 ambassadors (depending on the year) help ensure students' transition to university life is as smooth as possible \u2014 a role ambassadors cherish.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI joined the SDSU Ambassador program because I wanted to have a meaningful and substantial impact on incoming first-year, transfer and graduate students at SDSU,\u201d said\u00a0Zak Labus, a graduate student in postsecondary educational leadership who recently completed his first full year as an Ambassador at the end of New Student Orientation. \u201cThe 55-minute campus walking tours give tour participants the chance to fall in love with the SDSU campus and community much like I did as a newly admitted student back in the spring of 2018.\u00a0\u201cThe opportunity to play a role in these services, in addition to the events and ceremonies we work during the academic year, is not only humbling but exciting, as I get to give back to the very people and to the community that I benefited from and grew up in during my four years as an undergraduate student,\u201d Labus said.\u00a0\u00a0Sarah Williams, a fifth-year business management and theatre arts double major, has been an Ambassador for two years.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI joined the Ambassador program because I wanted to share the deep love I have for our campus with others and hopefully make incoming students and families love it as much as I do,\u201d said Williams. \u201cI truly have had such a great experience at SDSU and I love interacting and sharing those experiences with others.\u201d\u00a0The Ambassadors program in recent years has introduced new tours to live up to the university\u2019s commitment to advance equity and inclusion in everything it does. This year, the program launched Black Excellence Historical Tours, which dive deep into the achievements of the university\u2019s Black students, alumni and others who played an influential role on campus, as well as tour the resources available to Black students.\u00a0\u00a0New Student and Parent Programs, the Division of Student Affairs and Campus Diversity, anthropology professor and University History Curator\u00a0Seth Mallios, the Black Resource Center and the Department of Africana Studies began planning work on the tours in 2021; they were implemented for Explore SDSU in March 2022.\u00a0\u00a0Other tours, including ones tailored toward Latinx and Indigenous students, are in the works, Velazquez said.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI think most importantly, we want to make sure that all of our families feel welcome at SDSU regardless of their background,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to ensure that our new students feel like SDSU can be their new home, and this tour is a first step toward us being inclusive to everyone and welcoming everyone to our campus.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re not having these tours just to check it off of a list,\u201d Velazquez said. \u201cAs the first face that many students and families see when they come to campus, we are making sure we are being intentional and supportive of all of our students, regardless of their background.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Among the highlights of the Black Excellence Historical Tour are when prospective students learn about\u00a0Leon Williams, a 1950 graduate of San Diego State College who became the first Black person elected to the San Diego City Council in 1969, the first elected to the Board of Supervisors in 1982 and was a key figure in placing the MTS SDSU Transit Center on campus. They learn about\u00a0Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s\u00a0speech at the Open Air Theatre in May 1964 and also about the impact of NBA All-Star and SDSU men\u2019s basketball legend\u00a0Kawhi Leonard.\u00a0\u00a0Michael Rumfola, who has guided the tour during its first year, said he\u2019s seen the impact it has had on prospective Black students, as well as on himself.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMy favorite part about the tour is learning and speaking on the significance of Blackculture at SDSU and San Diego,\u201d said Rumfola, a fourth-year student double majoring in Business Marketing and Sustainability. \u201cI feel more connected to my culture and university when engaging tour participants in civil rights-related discussion.\u201d\u00a0Because an Ambassador can lead a tour for many different majors or student groups, they have to learn about all of the various majors and disciplines at SDSU \u2014 no easy task, said\u00a0Ximena Lopez Rivera, a third-year English major who has been an ambassador for a year.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI knew the position was very demanding, but learning a tour script about every single program and all the resources that the university offers and being able to understand each one is something that I wouldn\u2019t have done if it wasn\u2019t for the position,\u201d said\u00a0Lopez Rivera. \u201cIt is all very rewarding and worth the time (including some all-nighters) in order to make an impact on someone, even if it is only one person.\u201d\u00a0Ambassador training includes meeting staff and faculty from different departments and all seven SDSU colleges and can be rewarding beyond conducting the tours.\u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t know that we would learn about so many useful resources the university has to offer in such detail and depth,\u201d said\u00a0Madeleine Young, who is in her third year as a health communication major. \u201cI feel very confident in my knowledge of almost every single department on campus, and it makes me look forward to answering questions from students and families.\u00a0Beyond the training, Ambassadors said one of the best features of the program is the camaraderie they develop with their peers.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMy favorite part of the SDSU Ambassadors is having the opportunity to interact with a diverse group of students on campus and connect with students from all seven colleges on campus,\u201d said\u00a0Xavier Martin, a third-year psychology major with an emphasis in neuroscience and an Ambassador for a year. \u201cThis organization has allowed me to meet students who I wouldn\u2019t typically interact with and to create connections outside of my college. I love the sense of community that is created among the SDSU Ambassadors and look forward to seeing familiar faces when I walk on campus.\u201d\u00a0Velazquez, who himself was an ambassador 20 years ago, said that hearing students praise the program is gratifying.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAs an alumnus of the program, coming full circle to see how it has evolved over the past 20 years is great,\u201d Velazquez said. \u201cWe know that it has an impact on our prospective students but to hear the impact it is having on our current student leaders is very rewarding.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\nLatest Stories\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSDSU\u2019s 2023 Quest for the Best Winners NamedAmped Up: Aztec Mentor Program Provides Student with Career Insights, Post-Graduation Job2023 Quest for the Best Applications Are Being AcceptedLatinx Resource Center Director Comes 'Full Circle'The STEMinist MystiqueAztecs Rock Hunger Returns with Record-Breaking EffortMore Than A Decade in the MakingSDSU's Paid Internship Initiative Aims to Close Opportunity Gap for UndergradsAztecs Rock Hunger Returns with $100,000 GoalWelcome to California.
