Satellites and powerful computers capture huge datasets that the team combs through and interprets, using sophisticated tools of data mining, artificial intelligence and machine learning.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cOur lab is thriving at the interplay of data science and earth observation,\u201d says El-Askary, a professor of computational and data science who leads Chapman\u2019s Earth Systems Science and Data Solutions Lab. \u201cOur work is very much applied research on things that are happening all around us. We study natural disasters and phenomena driven by humans that can have a drastic impact on a local, regional and global scale.\u201d\nRecently, the lab\u2019s work got a huge boost as Congressmember Lou Correa delivered a $1 million federal grant that expands the team\u2019s research opportunities. In addition to California\u2019s current drought and the huge wildfire risk that comes with it, areas of research include the impact of aerosols on the retreat of Sierra Nevada glaciers as well as the salinity of the state\u2019s soils in agricultural regions.\n\u201cDroughts and climate change are having a significant influence on agricultural production in California, and every Californian is feeling the effects,\u201d Rep. Correa said during a visit to the lab in April. Correa represents the 46th congressional district, which includes the Chapman campus in Orange.\nProfessor Hesham El-Askary discusses the work of his Chapman lab with Congressmember Lou Correa.\n\u201cProfessor El-Askary and Chapman have established scientific and mapping capabilities with the potential to become a geoscientific classification system that is universally applicable in response to these crucial concerns,\u201d Correa added. \u201cThis lab\u2019s outstanding work is vital in combating climate change and ensuring that our community establishes a permanent research center dedicated to addressing global problems.\u201d\nHaving a Voice at UN Climate Conference\nThis is a particularly impactful year for El-Askary and the Chapman students who assist him in the Earth Systems Science and Data Solutions Lab. Through their collaborations on international research work, including in North Africa, the Middle East and the Balkans, the team has been preparing to help influence discussions and global policymaking during the UN Climate Change Conference 2022 (COP 27) this November in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.\nPreviously, El-Askary, an Egyptian native, helped develop the first analytical solar Atlas of Egypt \u2013 now considered the official document of the Egyptian government for solar investment. In August, he was named vice president of the Egyptian Space Agency \u2013 a position that will broaden his perspective to include the view of administration and strategy as he continues to mentor his students, El-Askary said.\n\u201cHesham has an extensive international partnership network and devotes a lot of energy building bridges that demonstrate the benefits of science and technology to the rest of the world,\u201d said Ghassem Asrar, former director of the World Climate Research Program and currently senior vice president for science at the Universities Space Research Association. \u201cHe\u2019s also a rare breed of scientist willing to work closely with the private sector to ensure that solutions we identify and develop benefit society.\u201d\nThe student lab team of Professor El-Askary,top right, includes, clockwise from front, Eric Adams, Shahryar Fazli, Niko Grisel Todorov, Sachi Perera and Rejoice Thomas.\nAlso among the beneficiaries of El-Askary\u2019s collaborative approach are the five Ph.D. students in his Chapman lab. There, the student researchers get a chance to take the lead on projects, mentored not just by El-Askary but also by renowned scholars like Erik Linstead, principal investigator of Chapman\u2019s Machine Learning and Affiliated Technologies (MLAT) Lab; Joshua B. Fisher, who worked at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and was lead scientist for a mission on the International Space Station before coming to Chapman as Presidential Fellow in Ecosystem Science; and Chapman President Daniele C. Struppa, an internationally recognized mathematician and researcher.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe student researchers in the lab include Shahryar Fazli (Ph.D. \u201922), who works on issues of food security and resource management, and Rejoice Thomas (MA \u201920, Ph.D. \u201923), who uses satellite imagery to predict crop yields and detect ocean plastics.\u00a0\nThomas is also part of a lab team studying sea level rise on the coastline of Alexandria, Egypt, and another led by El-Askary examining the structural integrity of a massive dam project on the Nile in Ethiopia.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to work on projects that refine data science techniques and merge science with policy so we can get results that best serve society,\u201d Thomas said.\u00a0\u00a0\nSharpening Their Focus to Assess Local Risks\nNiko Grisel Todorov (Ph.D. \u201923)\u00a0 previously developed software for Fortune 100 companies and assessed the risks of natural hazards for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\u00a0\nNow, he\u2019s adapting global research models and applying them to central Orange County, assessing earthquake risk and considering what essential facilities might get damaged in the event of a 500-year flood.\u00a0\n\u201cThe global model is like drawing with a crayon, and now we\u2019re sharpening our pencil and fine-tuning our focus to look at a smaller area,\u201d Todorov said.\u00a0\nAssisting that sharpening are Sachi Perera (Ph.D. \u201923) and Eric Adams (Ph.D. \u201923), who are developing specialty skills in AI and machine learning that can be applied across the team\u2019s panoply of projects.\u00a0\n\u201cAI is the concept \u2013 designing an intelligent machine \u2013 and machine learning implements what we learn from the AI architecture,\u201d explained Adams.\u00a0\nWith such cutting-edge tools, it\u2019s possible to determine the cause of past environmental events, Adams noted.\n\u201cWe are looking at the impact of climate change, but to detect that impact, you need to look into the history,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nCurrently, the entire lab team is working on a major report on climate impact in the Persian Gulf Region, in collaboration with the World Bank and the Arab League.\u00a0\nThe lab team is considering local and global risks associated\u00a0with climate change, including possible damage in the event\u00a0of a 500-year flood.\n\u201cEveryone is eager for these findings because the Gulf Region is among the areas that will be affected most dramatically by climate change in the years ahead,\u201d El-Askary said.\u00a0\nAs the effects of climate change continue to manifest globally and locally, the Earth Systems Science and Data Solutions Lab has a chance to develop a growing number of research projects that inform policy at all levels of decision-making.\u00a0\nFrom satellites in space to a basement lab at Chapman, the insights and impact are just beginning to resonate.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s evident that the world is witnessing a global change, and the intersection between earth observation and data science is critical to mitigating and adapting to that change,\u201d El-Askary said. \u201cWith the advancements in our lab, we\u2019re prepared to lead in this area.\u201d\n\n\n\nbig data climate change Data Science features research \n\n\n\n\n \n\nDennis Arp \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman University Administrators Carry the Banner Of Leadership\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the Maelstrom of a Romance for the Ages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Family Donors Make a Collective Impact On Giving Day\u00a0 Thanks to the enthusiasm of the Chapman Family, Chapman University\u2019s fifth annual Giving Day was an unrivaled success.
