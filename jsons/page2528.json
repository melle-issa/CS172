\u00a0Toolkit\n\n\n\nFaculty and Staff Resource Guide\n\n\n\nAnti-Oppression\n\nBringing Anti-Racism and Allyship into the Classroom and Bringing Anti-Racism and Allyship into Your Practice: Self-paced online coursesAnti-racism is the \u201cactive process of identifying and eliminating racism by changing\n                                 systems, organizational structures, policies and practices and attitudes, so that\n                                 power is redistributed and shared equitably\u201d (from the National Action Committee on\n                                 the Status of Women International Perspectives: Women and Global Solidarity). Building\n                                 on the resources in a toolkit created at Wheaton College, these CIE self-paced courses guide faculty and staff through the steps necessary\n                                 to build a more anti-racist institution. Note that Bringing Anti-Racism and Allyship into the Classroom focuses more specifically on instructional roles while Bringing Anti-Racism and Allyship into Your Practice is more general and applies to any role.\nWhat does it mean to be an anti-racist ally?Resources to provide a starting point for those who want to take action to be more\n                                 effective allies.\nAnti-racism and Allyship in the Classroom: Discipline-specific resource listSuggestions and resources for instructors looking to advance racial and social justice\n                                 across the curriculum, with a focus on discipline-specific applications and examples.\nAllyship for the African American Community\u00a0(June 2020)There are many specific actions you can take as an individual to strengthen your allyship\n                                 and demonstrate your commitment to support our Black students, colleagues and community.\nTeaching and Supporting Black Students: Advancing Student Needs in Times of Racial\n                                    CrisisThis online teach-in was held on Thursday, June 4, 2020.\nAntisemitism Crisis in our Community : What it is, What to do (recording)This online teach-in was held Tuesday, August 17, 2021. (PDF of slides)\n\nInclusive Communication\n\nManaging Challenging ConversationsSuggestions and resources to help manage challenging moments and be a more effective\n                                 upstander when microaggressions happen.\nWhen Tragedy StrikesSuggestions and resources for supporting our students, colleagues and classmates when\n                                 there are incidents that target specific communities.\nInclusive LanguageHow we communicate can both reflect and perpetuate implicit biases so for many people,\n                                 ensuring that we are using inclusive language can require a conscious effort to reflect\n                                 on the implications of our word choice and to develop new habits.\u00a0The resources on\n                                 this page are intended to provide some guidance for that work.\nFacilitator Guide for Diversity ConversationsAs SDSU strives to truly embrace \u201cequity and inclusion in everything we do\u201d, many\n                                 more faculty and staff are engaging in conversations around justice, equity, diversity\n                                 and inclusion. While these conversations are important and necessary to ensure meaningful\n                                 action, they also can be challenging and fraught with the potential for misunderstandings.\n                                 This guide is intended to help those who may be leading these conversations to facilitate\n                                 open and honest exchange while maintaining collegial and inclusive interactions.\nFiltering EmailFaculty and staff often receive unwanted emails from colleagues. Although free speech\n                                 protections limit San Diego State University\u2019s ability to stop such messages, you\n                                 are certainly not obligated to read or respond to them. We have collected several\n                                 options if you would like to filter your unwanted, non-University-business email.\n\nStudent Support\n\nSupporting Student Whole HealthThis presentation reviews campus resources and how you can help students struggling\n                                 with their mental and emotional health, well-being, basic needs insecurities and other\n                                 crisis situations (title link goes to recording; the slides are also available)\nInclusive Student Support in the Virtual Environment (video series)This series of virtual discussions was offered in Summer 2020 and focuses on key principles\n                                 of inclusive online student services.\u00a0\nTeaching and Supporting the Whole Student\u00a0(video series)An important aspect of equity-minded teaching and student support is understanding\n                                 what is happening in students\u2019 lives, as well as knowing about resources to which\n                                 you may be able to refer students for help with a range of issues.\nResources for Student Support - Personal and Academic (Canvas resource pages)These pages compile links with brief descriptions of campus resources.\n\nTeaching\n\nMaintaining Equity and Inclusion in Virtual Learning EnvironmentsAs SDSU strives to keep our students, faculty and staff safe in these unusual times,\n                                 many faculty are wondering how they can ensure that they continue to serve ALL of\n                                 their students. This guide provides suggestions and resources to help faculty continue\n                                 teaching in ways that are equitable and inclusive as they move to teach face-to-face\n                                 classes remotely.\nInclusive PedagogyAn inclusive classroom is one where ALL students feel welcome, safe to participate,\n                                 and supported in their learning. This resource page provides links to multiple sources\n                                 for strategies to create such an environment.\nDiversity and Inclusion Syllabus StatementsYour syllabus is often the first introduction students have to you and your course\n                                 and is an opportunity to set a positive tone for everything that follows. Including\n                                 a diversity and inclusion statement can be an important signal of your commitment\n                                 to supporting ALL of your students.\nFoundations of Effective and Inclusive Course Design: Online course, 8-10 hours to completeIn this self-paced course, participants will learn about evidence-based and inclusive\n                                 teaching practices and will develop learner-centered course learning outcomes, assessments\n                                 and activities for multiple modalities. This is a good option for those who need ultimate\n                                 flexibility and/or do not feel able to commit to anything time-bound this summer.\nClosing Equity Gaps in Student SuccessThis page provides a step-by-step process for individual faculty or department teams\n                                 who are looking for evidence-based strategies.\nInclusive Teaching in the Virtual Environment\u00a0(video series)This series of virtual discussions was offered in Summer 2020 and focuses on key principles\n                                 of inclusive online teaching.\nIdentifying and Responding to Bias in Teaching Evaluations (recording),\u00a0Fri March 26Students' evaluations of faculty teaching have long been used as a strategy to assess\n                                 teaching effectiveness in college and university courses. However, recent calls for\n                                 more equitable practices in retention, tenure, and promotion processes and studies\n                                 concluding that women and faculty of color experience negative bias in student evaluations\n                                 have led some to question their validity and utility. This workshop discusses how\n                                 bias manifests in student evaluations and propose strategies for mitigating it.\nResources for Student Support (Canvas resource page)One way that instructors can support students is by providing information on campus\n                                 resources. The page linked here can be imported directly into any of your own Canvas\n                                 courses.\n\nAdditional Topics\n\nResources for colleagues experiencing emotional, relational, behavioral or mental\n                                    health concernsThe pandemic has highlighted the need for all of us to practice self-care and seek\n                                 out help when we need it.\u00a0\nWorking and Teaching RemotelyWorking and Teaching Remotely was an online program where members of the San Diego\n                                 State Community could come together and get practical advice/suggestions on how to\n                                 deal with the new environment we are all experiencing.\nImplementing the Plan: Strategy, Solidarity, SustainabilityThis is a recording from Dr. Sumun Pendakur's CIE community professional learning\n                                 opportunity on March 16, 2021. Implementing a strategic plan brings opportunities\n                                 and lessons to all involved. We\u2019ll dive in to explore how students, staff, and faculty\n                                 can be in coalition, while also moving the needle on their locus of control in meaningful\n                                 ways.\nGetting to Know IVA college of SDSU, SDSU-IV has a rich history of serving southeastern California as\n                                 a source of quality education and research.
