Comprised of seven distinct programs, EOSP increases college access to historically disadvantaged student populations and provides comprehensive support through their college journey with the goal of increasing college completion rates.EOSP includes TRIO Educational Talent Search, Upward Bound, Upward Bound Math and Science, Student Support Services, Educational Opportunity Program, Dream Center, and PATH Scholars. Together, we serve low income and first-generation college bound and current college students, undocumented students, former foster youth, and unaccompanied homeless youth.EOSP Organizational Chart (PDF)Our Programs\n                        Educational Opportunity Program (EOP)\n                    \n                        PATH Scholars (FYP)\n                    \n                        Dream Center (DRMC)\n                    \n                        TRiO Educational Talent Search (ETS)\n                    \n                        TRiO Student Support Services (SSS)\n                    \n                        TRiO Upward Bound (UB)\n                    Vice President for Student AffairsKendall Hall, Room 110530-898-6131www.csuchico.edu/saDivision of Student AffairsAccessibility Resource CenterAssociated StudentsBasic Needs ProjectCareer CenterEquity, Diversity & InclusionEarly Outreach & Support ProgramsEnrollment Management\u00a0ServicesFinancial Aid & ScholarshipsIntercollegiate AthleticsOff-Campus Student ServicesStudent Conduct, Rights & ResponsibilitiesStudent Life & LeadershipUniversity HousingWellCat Services\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.Contact UsNeed Help?FacebookFacebookTwitterTwitterInstagramInstagramReport an accessibility issueReport a broken link on this pageTitle IXPrivacy PolicyCalifornia State University, Chico400 West First StreetChico, CA 95929Copyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n",
