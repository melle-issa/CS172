In the first two years of the study, Cheney and her team conducted interviews in person, but in the third year the interviews were conducted via Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were asked two questions on three occasions:\u00a0\n\nHow are health and well-being concepts integrated into university operations, such as business practices and policies?\nHow do public health initiatives focused on health promotion and well-being for students, staff, and faculty contribute to creating cultures of campus health?\n\nOver the course of the study, participants noted an increase in programs for faculty and staff and campus leadership support for large-scale health events. They also noted that department chairs, faculty, and staff promoted health through activities, such as leadership walk-and-talks and walking meetings.\nStudy participants also discussed:\u00a0\n\nhealthier options in vending machines and from catering\u00a0\nthe importance of the zero-alcohol tolerance policy and the educational push to raise awareness of alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse on campus\u00a0\nembedding more holistic concepts of health and well-being into existing learning and working practices and policies\u00a0\ncontinued efforts to include more campus spaces for rest, relaxation, and mindfulness activities, and shaded walking/running trails for physical activity and stress management\u00a0\nbetter and more flexible staff mental health services\naccess to healthy foods\u00a0\nno work emails sent after 5 p.m.\n\n\n \n\nHealthy snack options are now available on campus.\n\nUCR is part of the Healthy Campus Network, or HCN, a UC system-wide initiative promoting innovative reforms in health and well-being. Over the course of the study, several policies were either made more visible or implemented by the HCN and UCR Healthy Campus \u2014 such as a smoke- and tobacco-free UCR campus.\u00a0\n\u201cOur work shows how, through top-down and ground-up approaches, higher education can integrate health and well-being into institutional practices,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cThis study illustrates the need for collaboration between faculty, students, staff, and administrators. Institutions of higher education cannot create cultures of health without grassroots leaders who elevate the voice of the community, placing it within the spaces of decision makers. At the same time, grass top leaders, such as administrators, cannot implement change and create healthy cultures without the buy-in of grassroots leaders. Both are necessary.\u201d\nThe research was funded, in part, by the UC Office of the President.\nCheney was joined in the study by Evelyn V\u00e1zquez at UCR; and Julie Chobdee at the University of Southern California. Here's how UCR became a healthier place in 2019.\nThe research paper is titled \u201cCreating Cultures of Health in the Academy: Bringing Together Top-Down and Ground-Up Approaches.\u201d\n\nShare this Story\nTags\n\nSchool of Medicine\nCenter for Healthy Communities\nHealthy Campus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity chat exposes pandemic-related health disparities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHang gliding a passion for SOM writer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst group of community college students accepted into UC Riverside California Medicine Scholars Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh schoolers get university-level education in particle physics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of California, Riverside\n\n900 University Ave.\n            Riverside, CA 92521\nTel: (951) 827-1012\n\n\nUCR Library\nCampus Status\nCampus Store\nCareer Opportunities\nDiversity\nMaps and Directions\nVisit UCR\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of California, Riverside\n\n             900 University Ave.\n            Riverside, CA 92521                         \n tel: (951) 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu \n\n\n Find Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n\nUCR News\n\nResearch Blog\n\nInside UCR Archive\n\nHuman Resources\n\nUC Path Portal\n\nStaff Assembly\n\nUC Newsroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Accessibility\nTerms and Conditions\n\u00a9 2023 Regents of the University of California\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us help you with your search\n\n\nEnter your Search Criteria.\n\n\n\nSearch All UCR\n\n\nSearch This Site\n\n\nCancel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
