There are alternatives but this one seem to be reasonable and accepted by the JS community. It's an implementation detail though and can be switched at any point.\nBuilt an API on top of the lower level package to register static and dynamic commands to meet the requirements above.\n\nTodo\n\n Polish the design\n Add minimum set of commands\n Add documentation\n Add tests\n Validate the API\n\nTesting Instructions\n1- Open the site editor\n2- Type cmd + k\n3- Use the command center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ud83c\udf89\n2\n mcsf and aurooba reacted with hooray emoji\n \ud83d\ude80\n1\n goodpenguins

really nice. Props to @SaxonF for initial work. Let's do a design pass on the modal that opens (CC: @jameskoster as well) so it feels at home with the componentry. Outside of that, in addition to the keyboard shortcut, we need a button to invoke this. Maybe that can be the search icon in the site hub:\n\nThere are some of the flows we can hopefully clarify a little with UI, placeholders, context, help text, focus styles etc. This GIF shows searching both content and commands, and illustrating some of the hiccips:\n\n\nFirst I searched for pages, but I hadn't drilled down to the page filter yet. Unless we enable page/content searching at the top level, we could potentially show some help text, a la \"no commands found\" \u2014 but with a better term than \"commands\".\nIf I do search for \"Navigate\", currently the only filter available, the text stays in place and then immediately filters the page search results. The net effect is that it looks like an error. I had to delete the text on the 2nd level to start searching pages. What's the best practice here?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\n\n\n\njameskoster\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Mar 24, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for the ping, I'm excited to dive into this next week!\n\nMaybe that can be the search icon in the site hub\n\nI agree on the location. Search icon may be fine to start but this feature could eventually grow far beyond searching, so it might be worth exploring some different (maybe more abstract) options.\nA slightly random thought and probably not something for this PR; it would be interesting if the input could entertain dictation, so this interface can in the future become a way to 'talk to WordPress'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\n\n\n\nSaxonF\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Mar 27, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthis feature could eventually grow far beyond searching, so it might be worth exploring some different (maybe more abstract) options.\n\n+1. If we launch with Create page or Create post , which I think we should, it already goes beyond search. \u2318 is often used but maybe something more magical :)\nWe can probably just copy over stylesheet from #49152 if we wanted to give this branch a stronger starting point, but can also just start fresh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ud83d\ude80\n1\n jasmussen reacted with rocket emoji\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n1 reaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\nyouknowriad\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Mar 27, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've added commands to navigate to \"new page\" or \"new post\".

Additional the the feedback already shared, here's some other thoughts / questions:\n\nClicking outside the modal should close it.\nIt would need to be felt out to be sure but I suspect that selecting an item (e.g. Page) should close the modal too.\nIs it worth trying a scrim to aid focus? A blur would be nice, but I know there are performance issue so it may have to be a simple overlay.\nWe should add a placeholder to the input with suggestions. Something like: \"Search for posts and pages, or try a command like Create\".\nShould the commands be universally accessible? I can only find the create page / post commands when searching at the root.\nIf you drill into 'Navigate to a page' then there's no way to get back to the root except for refreshing the entire page. We either need a UI to get back to the root, or make cmdk always expose the root on-open.\n'Create' flows leading to post editor felt unexpected but may be a necessary interim until we figure out Experimenting with ability to focus on editing the post or editing the template\u00a0#49292, and other missing features like drafts / revisions.\nI can only invoke the command center when the dark material is visible in the Site Editor. I'm not sure how trivial it is to make it accessible in other areas, but it should probably be accessible in the full-screen editor, and the post editor?\nA search for 'Index' returned nothing. It feels like templates (and parts) should be included.\nWe should design a 'no results' state.\nThe dedicated 'Navigate to a page' view only really seems useful when there are very few pages at the site. I think we should encourage folks to search rather than navigate per-post-type list views \u2013 they probably wont scale very well.\n\nDisplaying n recent destinations (posts/pages/templates for now) at the root may be useful shortcuts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\nyouknowriad\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Mar 27, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMade some tweaks here.

When I'm in a busy newsroom, I probably never want to see a header and a footer. And when I'm editing page-first, I don't want to have to worry about ensuring all my blocks are inside the Post Content block, lest they become global.

If separate, then in the mean time do we continue to list all-the-things in lieu of context?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            68 hidden items\n          \n\n            Load more\u2026\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n youknowriad\nand others\n        added 13 commits\n        \nApril 6, 2023 09:54\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHighlight the searched text\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc59ee40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRemove useless custom search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9b237ad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMake the API private for now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf064740\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAdd a couple e2e tests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1cbad9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFix lock file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2c23eb9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nfont weight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38ad2ce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPrevent browser default on Meta+K\n\n\n    \u2026\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6997207\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Firefox, Meta+K pulls up the browser's search box.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFix unregistering command loaders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf155e52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFix comment typos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nca57c7d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRemove leftovers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne238211\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nReset search on close\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nec903f5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nReplace create with add\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n172d6cf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nUse an experimental flag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8cb81b7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nyouknowriad\nforce-pushed\n    the\n        \n\nadd/commands\n\n\n branch\n    from\n    \n8d43c31\n    to\n    \n8cb81b7\n  \nCompare\n\n\n\nApril 6, 2023 08:56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\nyouknowriad\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 6, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there are still different opinions on how to organize and design the command center, and also in terms of behavior, I've added an \"experiment\" flag to the Gutenberg experiments page to enable the command center. This will allow us to ship this and iterate without impacting the users yet.
