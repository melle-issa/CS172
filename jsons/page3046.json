They discuss finding the balance in the small and big pictures of product development, highlighting the process of trial and error. Top Takeaways  Courage Under Fire. After what feels like a miserable failure, it\u2019s vital to keep trudging forward. Great product design takes time to build and grow in the space you are putting it into. Keeping your passion alive and remaining consistent in your efforts will eventually lead you to success. The Impact of Thoughtful Design. Developing a product is of course based on meeting some kind of user need, but it\u2019s important to consider if you are really going to make that user\u2019s life easier with your product. When the end user is your top priority, your product will shine, and you\u2019ll be proud of the direct impact you made in someone\u2019s everyday life. Finding the Spark in Your Product. Focusing on the overall product journey is key for great product development, but zooming in on the minor details is also just as important. Brainstorming and finding the spark is not easy, but it is crucial to set your product apart from the rest. Using Your Audience to Improve Development. Put your ideas and questions out there for your audience to speak to. If you are wondering how people will perceive a certain product aspect or want more information on what their exact pain points are, it\u2019s good to directly ask. Getting information straight from your customers or peers can help you make well-informed decisions in product development. \ud83d\udd17 Mentioned in the show:  Crop.Express StickerMule \ud83d\udc26 You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:  Corey Maass Cory Miller (CEO, Post Status) Olivia Bisset (Intern, Post Status)  The Post Status Draft podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. \ud83d\udcddBrowse our archives, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe via iTunes, Google Podcasts, YouTube, Stitcher, Simplecast, or RSS. \ud83c\udfa7   \n      36 minutes |\n      Mar 23, 2023\n      \n          Corey & Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live - Session 6\n         Learn from Corey Maass, a master of WordPress plugins and apps, and Cory Miller, a marketing, business, and WordPress experience guru.

Starting a business can be a lonely experience. Having someone to bounce ideas off, talk through tough subjects with, and celebrate successes with makes a significant difference. Having that collaborative support system can make managing a business more enjoyable and streamlined, which is a huge benefit, especially for startups and small businesses. Discussion vs. Decision. It\u2019s important to be intentional with communication considering the stage you are in when you are improving a product or creating something brand new. Being vocal about whether you are still discussing or whether you are ready to make decisive moves is critical to keep the process moving forward without missteps. The Art of Failing. Understanding that taking risks and being willing to fail in order to ultimately achieve success is key for solopreneurs and partnerships. Quantifying your success rate on projects isn\u2019t the ultimate indicator of how successful you truly are. Stumbling through a myriad of shortcomings while still pursuing success is powerful. \ud83d\udd17 Mentioned in the show:  Crop.Express Elementor Beaver Builder \ud83d\udc26 You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:  Corey Maass Cory Miller (CEO, Post Status) Olivia Bisset (Intern, Post Status)  The Post Status Draft podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. \ud83d\udcddBrowse our archives, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe via iTunes, Google Podcasts, YouTube, Stitcher, Simplecast, or RSS. \ud83c\udfa7   \n      92 minutes |\n      Mar 15, 2023\n      \n          Post Status Live \u2013 The Right Approach to WordPress Accessibility\n         The talented team from Modern Tribe joined Cory Miller for this critical discussion about accessibility in WordPress. They highlight accessibility as a non-negotiable aspect of web development and provide guidance for leaders, developers, and designers to ensure your websites are accessible to all people. Top Takeaways:  Why Value Accessibility? Accessibility ensures all people have access to the things we create. It can\u2019t be an afterthought or something for the web dev team to figure out. It must drive the entire creative process and serve as an anchor to ground our teams and our work. Requirement vs. Challenge. Most creative projects work within a set of requirements. These don\u2019t prohibit the creative process. Instead, they challenge us to enhance the things we build and make them better than we might have without thinking through and within these constraints. It\u2019s All Around Us. We think of accessibility as a new idea, but in so many spaces, it\u2019s the norm. We have curb cutouts and braille signage. We see this every day, so tech is catching up. Improving Usability. Developing through the lens of accessibility means delivering experiences that solve people\u2019s problems and help them with tasks. It Takes Tools. The creative and engineering are just rails. Utilizing tools to ensure accessibility when publishing and setting up processes and guidelines will equip you to flex as requirements change. It\u2019s necessary for your organization to resource accessibility for it to be done effectively. \ud83d\udd17 Mentioned in the show:  Modern Tribe Eric Meyer MySpace \ud83d\udc26 You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:  Chris Kindred (Director of Backend Development, Modern Tribe) Sarah Gless (Creative Director, Modern Tribe) Mike Klanac (Director of Business Development, Modern Tribe) Cory Miller (CEO, Post Status) Olivia Bisset (Intern, Post Status)  The Post Status Draft podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. \ud83d\udcddBrowse our archives, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe via iTunes, Google Podcasts, YouTube, Stitcher, Simplecast, or RSS. \ud83c\udfa7   \n      82 minutes |\n      Mar 15, 2023\n      \n          Corey & Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live - Session 5\n         As the development of Crop.Express continues, Cory Miller and Corey Maass continue to gain clarity on what is needed for their product to succeed. They discuss features and integration, free vs. paid versions, ensuring compatibility, and more, as they fold in their experience, expertise, and gathered feedback into the future strategy of their product business. Top Takeaways:  Cultivating empathy is important for developers. It's essential to understand the needs of different users, particularly those who are not very tech-savvy or who come from different cultural backgrounds. Empathy helps create products that are more user-friendly and accessible to a broader audience. Collaboration is crucial for success. No matter how brilliant a product developer is, they can't do everything on their own. They need a team of people with different skills and backgrounds to support them, whether it's in terms of design, marketing, or other areas. Building a supportive team requires humility and a willingness to accept feedback and help from others. Failure is a necessary part of growth. Many product developers go through a difficult experience where they realize that their work isn't as good as they thought it was. This experience can be humbling, but it's also an opportunity to learn and grow. It's important for developers to be open to feedback, to take risks, and to be willing to try new things, even if it means making mistakes along the way. \ud83d\udd17 Mentioned in the show:  Sticker Mule Canva Kickstarter Unsplash Stock Unlimited \ud83d\udc26 You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:  Corey Maass Cory Miller (CEO, Post Status) Olivia Bisset (Intern, Post Status)  The Post Status Draft podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. \ud83d\udcddBrowse our archives, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe via iTunes, Google Podcasts, YouTube, Stitcher, Simplecast, or RSS. \ud83c\udfa7   \n      92 minutes |\n      Mar 10, 2023\n      \n          Corey & Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live - Session 4\n         In this episode, Corey Maass and Cory Miller focus on preparing Crop.Express for launch. They discuss building launch assets, utilizing a freemium model as a path toward a premium product, and future possibilities. Top Takeaways:  Value of a Soft Launch. This is a great way to test the waters and get initial feedback. If you utilize a soft launch, you need to be willing to make changes and improvements based on that feedback before you fully launch. Building a Sustainable Premium Product. Start by setting up a basic website and integration to attract customers. Establishing a freemium model allows you to identify what users will value enough to pay for and provides space for your plugin to become a recommended tool for users, agencies, and hosting providers as a premium product. Feedback as Fuel. Gathering input from customers and agency owners in the WordPress ecosystem can help you understand the barriers to adoption, like already established workflows, the challenge of installing and learning a new tool, and limitations within initial versions to full adoption. Importance of Image Use. Current workflows make images an afterthought in content creation, but they are critical to drawing interest, provide context, and evoke emotion. While there may be SEO value, the primary purpose is to appeal to human visitors. Creating tools to make this easier is the case for Crop.Express. Consider the possibilities. As product creators, you should continue to explore potential opportunities for development. Leveraging AI, increasing user engagement, and offering more value can uncover future revenue streams while you focus on current integration points. \ud83d\udd17 Mentioned in the show:  Crop.Express Canva Photoshop Stock Unlimited Unsplash Content Journey Hacker News Beaver Builder Patrick Garman Hendrick Luehrsen Elementor Jess Frick Pressable Kadence \ud83d\udc26 You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:  Corey Maass Cory Miller (CEO, Post Status) Olivia Bisset (Intern, Post Status)  The Post Status Draft podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. \ud83d\udcddBrowse our archives, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe via iTunes, Google Podcasts, YouTube, Stitcher, Simplecast, or RSS. \ud83c\udfa7   \n      26 minutes |\n      Mar 10, 2023\n      \n          Interview With Product Lead Brandon Dove Of Pixel Jar\n         Brandon Dove, co-founder of Pixel Jar, joins Cory Miller to discuss his WordPress plugin, AdSanity Plugin. They dive into the nuance of advertising, evaluate the benefits of free and paid plugins, and talk through the challenges and opportunities available to agencies who invest in product development while providing other services. \u00a0 Top Takeaways:  Recurring Product Revenue. While it can be challenging for an agency to balance custom service work with product development, having a product that generates recurring revenue can provide a cushion and diversify the overall business revenue. AdSanity is a successful example of this, and the team is working on dedicating more resources towards the product to even out development between the two sides of their business. However, it can be difficult to maintain free plugins without generating revenue, and it's important to consider how to incorporate them into the business model. Value vs. Spam in Advertising. For many people, advertising has become a four-letter word, so there is a need to help customers become good advertisers rather than just spamming ads everywhere. It\u2019s critical to empower your visitors by explaining the importance of creating a community around the site to allow for more meaningful conversations with visitors. The Point of Free Plugins. Building free plugins is more about passion and community engagement than being a lead generator. The main outcome has been connecting with people within the WordPress community, but those connections remember to come to you for solutions. So the increased exposure can lead to revenue in the long term.  \ud83d\ude4f Sponsor: GoDaddy Pro\u00a0 Top-Tier Managed WordPress hosting solutions for Enterprise, the Public Sector, and Media companies.

Top Takeaways:  Workflow Education. Getting adoption for workflows can be challenging. Agencies may resist changes to their workflow even if the change may bring significant benefits. Investing in education is key. Contributing to WordPress education by testing things and hosting workshops and demonstrations can ensure the project as a whole succeeds. Scaling is the Safety of WordPress. Many of the page builder softwares are not built for much beyond brochure-type sites. The extensibility of WordPress makes so much possible for businesses looking to deliver excellent customer experience or expand their site capabilities. Competition vs. Cooperation. Today there is far more competition in WordPress. In the early days, competition existed alongside cooperation. We were competing while we shared, learned, and grew together. This cooperation led to innovation within WordPress and cultivated a vibrant, growing ecosystem. A shift towards community innovation can remind us that a rising tide lifts all boats. \ud83d\udd17 Mentioned in the show:  Blogspot Revolution Studio Press Nathan Rice WP Tavern Justin Tadlock Webflow Figma AJ Morris Rafal Tomal Design Kit Frost WordPress Learn GoDaddy Automattic Squarespace Wix Weebly Shopify Sarah Dunn Gravity Forms Pagely Beaver Builder Elementor \ud83d\udc26 You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:  Brian Gardner (Developer Advocate, WPEngine) Cory Miller (CEO, Post Status) Olivia Bisset (Intern, Post Status)  The Post Status Draft podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. \ud83d\udcddBrowse our archives, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe via iTunes, Google Podcasts, YouTube, Stitcher, Simplecast, or RSS. \ud83c\udfa7   \n      83 minutes |\n      Mar 3, 2023\n      \n          Corey & Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live - Session 3\n         In this episode, Corey Maass and Cory Miller share the results of submitting their WordPress plugin, Crop.Express to the repo. As they continue to build their product live, they develop branding, messaging, and strategy to validate their business and cultivate an audience. Top Takeaways:  Expanding Outwards. Repo offers inherent discoverability for WordPress products, but cultivating broader awareness is necessary for a product to succeed. Creating brand assets, a website, and a newsletter create conduits for growth. Feel Out Your Brand. Be cautious not to box yourself in with branding. Consider what feeling you want people to get when using your product. Go a little deeper and have a little fun exploring the solutions and feelings you hope to offer as you create your branding. Move from literal to conception to better understand what defines your business. Ring the Bell. Identify your customer\u2019s problem and keep talking about it. Invite ideal users to talk about it. Leverage your personal platforms to highlight the pain point and how your product improves it. By telling that story and having others do the same, you start to build a case for your business. \ud83d\udd17 Mentioned in the show:  Crop.Express Bill O\u2019Reilly Generate WP Canva Minesweeper Photoshop Stock Unlimited Fiver Instagram Unsplash YouTube PayPal Content Journey Zoom \ud83d\udc26 You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:  Corey Maass Cory Miller (CEO, Post Status) Olivia Bisset (Intern, Post Status)   \n      71 minutes |\n      Feb 23, 2023\n      \n          Corey & Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live - Session 2\n         In this episode, Corey Maass and Cory Miller share their initial version or MVP of the product they are building, Crop.Express.\u00a0 Together they work through enhancing UX, selecting the right business model, crafting marketing messages, and more. Top Takeaways:  Work Out the Workflow. You will teach people how to use your product with demos or tutorials. While you want to make adjustments to improve UX, you don\u2019t want to constantly change the workflows for your product. Being thoughtful on the front end can result in better usability and less change. Business Models. Building a product also means determining a business model. Offering some functionality for free can gain exposure for a base product. Adding a pro or paid version with increased value to deliver a better end product for a customer. Focus on Feedback. As a product builder, you work to anticipate pain points and solve for them. With a quality product, you will solve real struggles for users. But there is a reason users are uninstalling. Accessing their input and experience could be the key to taking your product to the next level. \ud83d\udd17 Mentioned in the show:  Crop.Express Canva Elementor \ud83d\udc26 You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:  Corey Maass Cory Miller (CEO, Post Status) Olivia Bisset (Intern, Post Status)   \n      24 minutes |\n      Feb 23, 2023\n      \n          Interview With Product Lead Mark Westguard Of WS Form\n         Learn from Mark Westguard, founder of WS Form, a powerful, next-generation WordPress form plugin. Mark and Cory discuss how AI is starting to integrate into the world of WordPress and how the WP Form software is leveraging its power.\u00a0 Top Takeaways:  Harnessing the Power of Open AI. The possibilities are endless with the revolution of AI as an open-source tool. Making the most of its capabilities allows WordPress users to create more intuitive and integrated content, like better fields and options in WordPress forms. Create, Edit, Moderate. AI should be seen as an assistant working alongside you to help generate your content. You\u2019re still essential in the creation process, and it\u2019s important not to rely on AI 100% for accuracy. You can get creative prompts, edit for grammar or spelling and generate unique images, but moderating that content is essential. The Future is All-in-One AI Integrated Tools. Limiting time spent running around to different AI software is good for business. So how can that be accomplished? By integrating the AI capabilities into WordPress tools, where everything you need is in one place. These are the things we look forward to in WordPress software and plugins  \ud83d\ude4f Sponsor: A2 Hosting A2Hosting offers solutions for WordPress and WooCommerce that are both blazing fast and ultra-reliable.

This core value has shaped Arnas\u2019 career path, from his roots in customer service to creating products to provide simple website restoration and security for principal vulnerabilities. Top Takeaways: Customer Obsession. Users are facing daily challenges that need real-time solutions. Think about their problems. Value their feedback. Sometimes clients are limited because we haven\u2019t kept up with the speed of evolving technology. Approaching things from a user perspective to prioritize and build products creates optimal impact. Removing Manual Work. Wherever possible, we are working to automate things to provide more easy buttons for clients. Automating things, creating single-click solutions, and providing the best examples and guidance to reduce users' steps to accomplish tasks. Possibilities with AI.

Top Takeaways:  Living in an Open Source Ecosystem. Developers don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel. With such a large ecosystem of products, finding a secret niche spot to develop your product isn\u2019t always the best or even attainable solution. Doing something better than the next company is sometimes all it takes for great success. The David and Goliath Struggle. It\u2019s obvious that there has always been and will continue to be an unbalanced level of success between independent WordPress product owners and large companies. But that\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t room for everyone; there is. An independent startup can move much faster into achieving short-term goals and growth than large-scale established companies can with a heavier workload and slower forward movement. Valuing Community Over All Else. The WordPress community is what drives the future of WordPress. It\u2019s not so much all the great new things the system offers but the people behind the process. Taking that same thought into your business, making people the center of your solutions, is an undeniable way to create a business that is surrounded by community. Removing Language Barriers. Creating website language translation is becoming more of a priority. It ties in with the need for developing a better user experience for your customers. Your community needs a specialized way to interact with your products and site. That\u2019s one main task Vova\u2019s team is tackling for their customers this year \ud83d\ude4f Sponsor: Elementor Elementor enables web creators to build professional, pixel-perfect websites with an intuitive visual builder.

Today he leads Alley Interactive, an agency focused on publishers, non-profits, museums, and brands. Brad shares his extensive experience in publishing technology and his view of the strengths and challenges within the enterprise market of WordPress. Top Takeaways:  Shifting to Paywall Content. Perhaps a major misstep in early online publishing was setting the expectation of free content. Now print subscriptions are down. Publishers can\u2019t secure advertising without extremely high volume. And consumers are hesitant to pay for online subscriptions.\u00a0 WordPress Creator Economies. Within WordPress there are software and content creators. Software creators the directory to serve as a centralized community and marketplace. Content creators face a bigger challenge to find their market because there isn\u2019t a collaboration tool and algorithm like a social platform driving the creator economy of WordPress. Enterprise WordPress vs. Competition. The closed platforms have appeal-single providers, monthly pricing models, built-in solutions. To customers who aren\u2019t aware of the benefits of open source, it can be confusing to help them understand the optionality and freedom they relinquish even if the initial investment of time and money is more. Enterprise WordPress faces the challenge of crafting appealing solutions without becoming the antithesis of open source. \ud83d\ude4f Sponsor: Pressable Founded in 2010, Pressable is a world-class managed WordPress hosting provider built on the same data network as WordPress.com and WordPress VIP.

After working as a software developer, he transitioned into WordPress and founded his own agency, DevriX. They coined the term \u201cWordPress retainer.\u201d It is the mantra fueling their operations and one they hope other agencies will adopt. He joins Cory Miller to dive deep into the how and why of WordPress retainers, sharing his experience and his hopes for the future of WordPress. Top Takeaways:  WordPress Retainers: Business doesn\u2019t have to be feast or famine. Several other industries utilize retainers because they provide consistent revenue and secure client commitment for ongoing work. The entire world is living around monthly costs. Not aligning your service-based business with that model is counterintuitive. Essentially it is just selling hours in bulk, turning services into products. Allotting 10% for project management while using the rest to prioritize and execute projects. The longevity and security enable you to plan, diversify, hire well and grow. Learn How the Sausage is Made: If you want to start your own business, work in a similar business for a few years. Learn what it takes to operate, what roles are needed, and how the pipeline works. Work with bosses, teams, and clients to learn how you want to build and operate once you\u2019re on your own. Increase Adoption by Building Simplification: Many of us started in WordPress because of the famous 5-minute install, and any design could become a theme. It was easy, but now building on other platforms is actually easier. WP needs to create tools to solve for this in order to increase adoption by younger generations. \ud83d\ude4f Sponsor: Elementor Elementor enables web creators to build professional, pixel-perfect websites with an intuitive visual builder.
