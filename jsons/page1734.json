Over the years,\n                              SDSU has forged strong ties with the parent community, which today works hand-in-hand\n                              with the campus administration.\nIn 2003, the first New Student and Family Convocation was introduced to SDSU. This ceremony officially welcomes new students and their\n                              families to the university. What had previously been known as Student Life Orientation,\n                              a one-day event, has evolved into Welcome Week.\nIn 2004, the office of New Students and Parent Programs (NSPP) was officially established to connect students and parents to valuable SDSU support\n                              services and programs. The office oversees:\n\nNew Student and Parent Orientation\nNew Student and Family Convocation\nWelcome Week\nFamily Weekend\nand many other events!\n\nPARENT EMAIL DISTRIBUTION LIST\n*NOTE* - If you have a new student (freshman or transfer) who is attending SDSU for\n                              the first time this fall, and you plan to register for Parent and Family Orientation,\n                              you are already on the email distribution list, and you are a member of the Aztec\n                              Parents Association.
