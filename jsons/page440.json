The event kicked off a project to significantly scale up a transformational way of thinking about and enhancing human development \u2013 through addressing the urgent crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. This approach, pioneered by the Natural Capital Project and its partners, quantifies and maps the values nature provides to people \u2013 such as clean air and water, fertile soil, rich ocean life, flood protection, heat protection, and carbon capture \u2013 allowing these services to be factored into land, water, and ocean use policies and investment decisions.\nTo facilitate more rapid uptake of these approaches, the Natural Capital Project, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the Asian Development Bank are working with 10 pilot countries (Armenia, Belize, Chile, China, Colombia, Cook Islands, Ecuador, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Uruguay) to support them in using natural capital information to design and inform policy and finance decisions. The project partners are also collaborating with the World Bank to share lessons from their Biodiversity, Ecosystems, and Landscape Assessment (BELA) initiative.\n\u201cWe are starting the engines of innovation,\u201d said Mary Ruckelshaus, executive director of the Natural Capital Project. \u201cThe in-country experts at this event brought understanding of what is needed in their countries. They are the innovators and the visionaries. The MDBs can amplify and take these innovations to scale, by developing standard policy and finance processes to help countries achieve their goals and visions. And the Natural Capital Project and its partners have technical and policy expertise to craft the \u2018how\u2019 \u2013 how do we get there, and what lessons are emerging on what more is needed for policies and financial instruments to work.\u201d\nAt the meeting, both country and MDB representatives shared experiences with different mechanisms for using natural capital information in policy and investments. These included Uruguay\u2019s sustainability-linked bond, in which the bond\u2019s interest rate is linked to compliance with its climate commitments in the Paris Agreement. Through the bond, private landowners have financial incentives to adjust grazing and land-use practices to both boost production and meet greenhouse gas emission targets, which are verified using natural capital accounting. \u201cWhen it's a financial commitment, it becomes a strategic priority,\u201d said Herman Kamil, director of debt management within Uruguay\u2019s economics ministry.\nIn addition, bonds had previously been a matter solely for their finance ministry, but \u201cthis caused us to bring in other players who usually don\u2019t work on bonds, from environment, agriculture, fisheries, energy, transportation, foreign affairs. All of a sudden our Whatsapp group was much bigger,\u201d said Kamil.\n\u00a0\n\n\nPanel of representatives from Asian Development Bank member countries.

This stemmed in part from a report the Natural Capital Project prepared for the Global Environment Facility in 2022 about the use of natural capital approaches, which noted the need for them to be taken up across all sectors of government. In some cases, the event at Stanford was the first time country representatives met their colleagues from other government departments.\nBeverly Wade, director of Belize\u2019s Blue Bond & Finance Permanence Unit, who attended the meeting with her colleague Leroy Martinez from the finance ministry, said one of their challenges will be helping other parts of government understand how natural capital approaches can help them with their own mandates. This is despite Belize\u2019s own success with a financial mechanism called a Blue Bond. In the single largest blue bond of its kind, they committed to protecting up to 30% of their ocean, and The Nature Conservancy worked with them to refinance $553 million of their debt. The funds from the refinancing went to an independent conservation fund. Wade said, \u201cThis meeting exposed us to how to leverage our success with blue bonds and expand on that through other non-traditional funding mechanisms, such as Uruguay\u2019s sustainability bond.\u201d\nChile shared a major step in the policy realm: their recent creation of a Natural Capital Committee housed within the office of the prime minister. Sof\u00eda Aroca from Chile\u2019s finance ministry said, \u201cThis project will help us to accelerate our process\u2026 The ideas we heard from around the world really helped us imagine how to do this in our country.\u201d Likewise, Cook Islands representatives Angelia Willams from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management and Tohoa Puna from the National Environment Service found other countries\u2019 approaches illuminating - and helped them understand how to talk about their existing work using the language of natural capital. \u201cI was very interested in China\u2019s GEP [Gross Ecosystem Product], although we are still in the very early stages of using natural capital information. Similarly, I was blown away by Belize. We could use their wins and make it fit our level,\u201d said Williams.\nOver the next 15 months, the Natural Capital Project and the MDBs will work with the pilot countries to co-develop natural capital approaches that inform specific policy or finance decisions, and further develop capacity for using them. Looking ahead to broadening its application in other countries, the NatCap and MDB teams will create a standardized framework for informing science-policy processes, and customizable tools and training materials.\nThe Natural Capital Project\u2019s key partners in this effort, the MDBs, have significantly ramped up their focus on nature-based solutions and natural capital approaches as core components of\u00a0 human development. In a 2021 joint statement on Nature, People and Planet presented at the Glasgow climate summit, 10 MDBs united in stating, \u201cprogress on global sustainable development, climate and biodiversity goals cannot be achieved without addressing the direct and indirect drivers of nature loss and transforming the way in which we value, use, conserve and share the benefits from nature.\u201d Both the Inter-American Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank have created \u201cNatural Capital Labs\u201d to accelerate and mainstream the use of natural capital approaches.\u00a0\n\n\nChilean government representatives in conversation at the April 17-19 event.

This is the \u2018heart\u2019 part of why people care about nature and what motivates behavior.\u201d\nIn her remarks, Gretchen Daily, Natural Capital Project co-founder, biology professor in Stanford\u2019s School of Humanities & Sciences, and recent winner of the Ecological Society of America\u2019s 2023 Eminent Ecologist Award, said: \u201cA much deeper cultural shift is needed to achieve this transformation: a recognition of how interdependent we are across the regions of the world we represent, and how deeply interdependent we are with nature.\u201d\nStay tuned for more on this project, which is funded in part by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.\nWith its global hub at Stanford University, the Natural Capital Project is a collaboration among academic partners including the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Stockholm Resilience Centre, and the University of Minnesota together with core implementing partners including The Nature Conservancy and World Wildlife Fund. The Natural Capital Project works with public and private sector partners and communities across the globe to measure the value nature provides to people. Integrating that value into decision-making can improve human wellbeing by securing Earth\u2019s life-support systems.\n\u00a0\n\nResearch Area:\u00a0Sustainable Development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n\n\n\nTwitter\n \n\n\n\nYouTube\n \n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\u200b\u200bContact Us\nSupport Our Work\nDownload InVEST\nSubscribe to Newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Home\nMaps & Directions\nSearch Stanford\nEmergency Info\n\n\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy\nCopyright\nTrademarks\nNon-Discrimination\nAccessibility\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
