While getting situated, still provisionally, we will patiently wait until our furniture to arrive from Miami. The weather is starting to get warmer, too. Everything is new. Good times. \nI also will start migrating the Gutenberg Times website to a block theme, and hopefully can take you along with my lessons learned and some tips to avoid the pitfalls. Maybe. If you already made the switch with one of your sites, email me to pauli@gutenbergtimes.com.  I really would like to learn more. \nBefore, I can start this next project, I will work on the next Gutenberg plugin release.

He will also explain the technologies that make the magic happen, and run through a variety of scenarios and use cases. There will be ample time for Q & A. You can register via Meetup. \n\nOn May 23, 2023 at 17:00 UTC / 12:00 PM EDT hosted by Justin Tadlock \nOn May 24, 2023 at 8:00 UTC / 15:00  Indonesia Time hosted by Michael Burridge\n\nYou can check out a live demo of WordPress Playground on the WordPress Developer site. \nEarlier this month, Zieli\u0144ski posted a few In-Browser WordPress Tech Demos: WordPress Development with WordPress Playground, with a call for contributors.

Step One she writes: \u201cOne of the biggest questions would be \u2018What is Gutenberg\u2019. I tend to push back around that and say it\u2019s WordPress. The system, the mindset, and the approach have been around for so long now and have been a part of the core development \u2013 after all, we are through phase two and starting phase three, Collaboration. So, this is step one to embracing Gutenberg as a product; see it as nothing different from WordPress.\u201d Curious? There are nine more to go! \n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f  New episode:  Gutenberg Changelog #82 \u2013 Gutenberg 15.6 and proposed schedule for WordPress 6.3 with Birgit Pauli-Haack and special guest Nick Diego\n\nPlugins, Themes, and Tools for #nocode site builders and owners\nJamie Marsland has a great video posted on WordPress TV called: Rapid Website Recreation. Within this 15-minute demo, he shows you how he rebuilt a photographer\u2019s website using the Site editor in WordPress. \n\nMike McAlister has announced the release of his new block theme Ollie and shared details and motivation in Introducing the Ollie WordPress block theme.  McAlister wrote: \u201cOne of the most powerful features of the Ollie block theme is that it brings together all the new WordPress site building features in a cohesive experience. Site editor,\u00a0global styles, patterns, templates, template parts\u00a0\u2014 Ollie supports all of these features, and they\u2019re all beautifully designed and super easy to edit and customize.\u201d \nSarah Gooding gave it a spin and reviewed for the WPTavern: Ollie Block Theme Now in Public Beta. \u201cIt is a beautiful, multipurpose theme of the high caliber one might expect from McAlister, a veteran developer whose past products were well known for their minimalist and clean design.\u201d she wrote. \nTheme Development for Full Site Editing and Blocks\nEarlier this week, I was asked: \u201cFor new block theme enthusiast, how can they get started?\u201d I collected a list of starting points: \nThere are three Learn WordPress courses: \n\nDevelop Your First Low-Code Block Theme\nA Developers Guide to Block Themes \u2013 Part 1\nA Developers Guide to Block Themes \u2013 Part 2\n\nIf you would rather not start from scratch but learn how to change your site with the site editor: \n\nPart 1: Simple Site Design with Full Site Editing\nPart 2: Personalized Site Design with Full Site Editing and Theme Blocks\nPart 3: Advanced Site Design with Full Site Editing: Site Editor, Templates and Template Parts\n\nOn the Developer blog, Daisy Olsen published a Block theme resources roundup. Since then, additional posts became available: \n\nIntrinsic design, theming, and rethinking how to design with WordPress\nBlock theme templates: the easy way to build an elegant grid of posts\nEverything you need to know about spacing in block themes\nUsing template patterns to build multiple homepage designs\nPer-block CSS with theme.json\n\nThe WordPress Themes team is working on an overhaul of the Theme Handbook. You can follow along on the Make Theme blog and the theme team meetings. \n\n\u00a0\u201cKeeping up with Gutenberg \u2013 Index 2022\u201d\u00a0A chronological list of the WordPress Make Blog posts from various teams involved in Gutenberg development: Design, Theme Review Team, Core Editor, Core JS, Core CSS, Test and Meta team from Jan. 2021 on. Updated by yours truly.  The index 2020 is here\n\nBuilding Blocks and Tools for the Block editor. \nJacob Smith, WordPress VIP team, announced the beta of the Block Data API, \u201cFor many use cases, it\u2019s helpful to access blocks in WordPress as pure JSON data instead of HTML.\u00a0 Doing so eliminates the need to write parsing layers to transform markup into JSON, and to keep those translation layers up to date with every version of Gutenberg.\u00a0 All of this saves developers time and effort.\u201d, he wrote. \n\nWell, this section almost became the exclusive Ryan Welcher\u2019s Corner for this edition. \ud83d\ude4c\n\nIn his latest post on the WordPress Developer Blog, Ryan Welcher outlined How webpack and WordPress packages interact. You learn more about the connection between @wordpress/scripts and the build process, and why it streamlines that build process for WordPress blocks. \n\nNathan Wrigley had Ryan Welcher on his WPTavern Jukebox podcast: Ryan Welcher on Using the create-block Tool to Quickly Scaffold a New Block Plugin . They discussed what you can expect from the create-block tool, and the prior knowledge that you\u2019ll need to have once the tool has you up and running. \nI have been using the create block command line tool to spin up a new block projects. It also helps you package your new block into a plugin and test it for the single block plugin repository.  You can also have multiple blocks in one block. You just want to study about the commands, and how they can make your life easier. The documentation pages are available in the block editor handbook: @wordpress/create-block. Once yours start using it, you probably would also be interested in creating a custom templates to add to the scaffolding tool. Follow along with the @wordpress/create-block-tutorial-template\n\nThursdays, you can catch Ryan Welcher on Twitch live coding. This week\u2019s show is still available on Twitch: Reviewing Gutenberg 15.6 features | Bring me your issues! For persistency, all streamed videos will also be uploaded to YouTube in due time. \n\nNeed a plugin .zip from Gutenberg\u2019s master branch?Gutenberg Times provides daily build for testing and review.
