Public repositories are free to host, private repositories require a paid subscription. GitHub introduced the concept of the \u2018pull request\u2019 where code changes done in branches by contributors can be reviewed and discussed before being merged be the repository owner.  https://github.com/ with first-look access to the upcoming WP20 Book.\n20 years \u2014 a new milestone\nOn May 27, 2023, WordPress celebrates a significant milestone in its journey as the project reaches its 20th anniversary. As part of the planned activities to mark this\u00a0achievement, project leadership commissioned a book last year to document the years since its first commissioned work, Milestones \u2013 The Story of WordPress (2003-2013.)\nThe next volume, Building Blocks: The Evolution of WordPress, spans the history of WordPress from 2013-2023 and catalogs its wins, learnings, and everything in between. From changes to how users engage with the platform to confronting a worldwide pandemic, the book reflects on the most impactful moments over the last decade.\nAs the book gets ready for general release on the anniversary of WordPress, you, the community, have a role to play in ensuring that the story comes to life.\nHow you can help\nYou\u2019re invited to play the role of editor by reviewing one or all of the 16 chapters. The book\u2019s chapters are available on GitHub; each chapter has its own markdown file and is immediately available for download.\nAs you get started, a very important resource that can prove helpful is The WordPress Writing Style Guide.\u00a0\nPlease focus on the content in your review rather than syntax, for instance. Here are some tips for what helpful feedback will look like providing additional source materials, including helpful links, offering potential images, spotting potential grammatical issues or typos, as well as any contextual documentation. Unhelpful feedback looks like offering a total rewrite or critique of the writing style.\nTo log a suggested edit, please create a new GitHub issue (one issue per ticket, please) and assign it to jpantani, who is assisting with this project\u2019s wrangling.\nQuick steps to take action\nStep 1: Familiarize yourself with the WordPress voice and tone\nStep 2: Visit and download the WP20-Book repo\nStep 3: Download and review the chapters\nStep 4: Log issue (one issue per ticket) and assign it to jpantani\u00a0\n(Optional) Step 5: Reach out on Making WordPress slackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform https://slack.com/.
