These activities are part of the strategic planning process that seek to facilitate a thoughtful transition from our current to our next strategic plan, and to ensure that Fullerton Forward 2024-2029 is built upon the collective vision of all Titan family members.  The strategic planning process will follow a data-driven approach, collecting, analyzing, synthesizing, and integrating the voices, ideas, and wisdom across our community, and will produce a strong foundational framework to guide our work in the next five years. \n\n\n\nYouTube Link to President Virjee Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSUF Strategic Plan 2024-2029: Plan Development Timeline\n\nUtilize a DATA-DRIVEN approach to guide the planning process\nEngage in REVIEW and REFLECTION of the current Strategic Plan to ensure thoughtful transition to the next plan\nSolicit and listen to the VOICES of ALL STAKEHOLDERS on and off campus\nCoordinate through a diverse committee to be established in spring 2023 to SYNTHESIZE and INTEGRATE stakeholder voices into the plan \n\n\n\n\nSpring 2023\nCAMPUS\n                    Review & Reflection\n\n\n\nJanuary\n\n Strategic Plan 2024-2029 planning launch\n\nFebruary\n\n Campus-wide REVIEW of Strategic Plan 2018-2023 progress\n\nMarch\n\n Campus-wide VISIONING of the future of CSUF\n\nApril\n\n Campus-wide REFLECTION on goals for the next 5 years\n\n\n\n\nSummer 2023\nCOMMITTEE\n      Plan Framework Development\n\n\n\nComing soon\n\n\n\n\nFall 2023 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Spring 2024\nCAMPUS / COMMITTEE\n        Plan Feedback, Finalization\n        & Launch\n        \n\n\n\nComing soon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Footer\n\n\n\n800 N.
