Research provides foundational insights and clever solutions. Thought leadership guides careful, forward-thinking innovation and policy. Plus, the university itself is a living lab for sustainable action.\nAs the stories below show, Stanford is working toward ambitious campus sustainability goals with efforts that address power use and generation, food waste, heating and cooling, commuting, travel, events, and much more. Altogether, Stanford is working toward producing zero waste by 2030 and has set a goal of generating 100 percent of campus electricity needs from renewable sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below peak levels by 2025\u00a0\u2013\u00a0both of which the university achieved in 2022 when a second solar energy plant came online. The university has committed to reaching at least net-zero emissions from its operations by 2050.\nThat commitment extends to campus research and education. In fall, the university launched the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability \u2013\u00a0its first new school in 75 years, which amplifies the university\u2019s sustainability scholarship, education, and impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nStanford joins White House forum on sustainability\nAurora Winslade, director of Stanford\u2019s Office of Sustainability, discusses key takeaways from the event, how universities can partner with governments to meet sustainability goals, and how Stanford is becoming a greener campus.\n \n\n\n\n \nStanford Dining addresses climate change one bite at a time\nResidential & Dining Enterprise\u2019s (R&DE) Stanford Dining, Hospitality & Auxiliaries is a leader in piloting indirect emissions reductions in partnership with the university\u2019s Scope 3 Emissions Program.\n \n\n\n\n \nUniversity Affairs\nHard-to-quantify emissions are the next frontier for Stanford sustainability goals\nStanford is celebrating Earth Day with a week of virtual events and is looking ahead to additional ways the campus can reach ambitious net-zero emissions goals, including tackling emissions from campus food, goods, travel and investments.\n \n\n\n\n \nLaunch party for the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability\nMore than 500 people celebrated the opening of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability on Sept. 29. At the event, speakers emphasized the urgent need to address climate change and global sustainability challenges.\n \n\n\n\n \nZero waste efforts lead to award winning streak\nStanford University is now a two-time first-place winner in the National Wildlife Federation\u2019s Campus Race to Zero Waste competition for per capita recycling in the large campus division. The award reflects many new and upcoming zero waste initiatives.\n \n\n\n\n \nStanford transitions to 100 percent renewable electricity with second solar plant\nStanford completes the university\u2019s transition to 100 percent renewable electricity as Solar Generating Station #2 begins commercial operation.\n \n\n\n\n \nUniversity Affairs\nReducing campus emissions focus of new Stanford program\nAchieving Stanford\u2019s goal of reaching at least net-zero emissions from its operations will require developing new tools and strategies, which could also help businesses and governments reach their own emissions goals.\n \n\n\n\n \nStanford\u2019s new environmental justice minor\nEvan Baldonado, \u201923, a third-year student in the School of Engineering and co-director of Students for a Sustainable Stanford, is the first student to adopt a minor in environmental justice. The minor is offered by the Earth Systems Program, which will become part of the new school focused on climate and sustainability.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScience & Technology\nSustainability\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to read next:\n\n\n\n\n \nScience & Technology\nA better, faster tool for saving water on farms\nA new tool for designing and managing irrigation for farms advances the implementation of smart agriculture, an approach that leverages data and modern technologies to boost crop yields while conserving natural resources.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \nScience & Technology\nBanking on nature\nThe Natural Capital Project is working with development banks and 10 pilot countries to put the environment at the forefront of policy and investment decisions.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \nLaw & Policy\nBeyond the room where it happened\nYou may have given little thought to the role Native Americans played in the creation of the U.S. Constitution.
