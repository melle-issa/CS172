Pre-WordCamp, we interviewed two of the organizers and published a collection of builder tips from the speakers. While at the event, we also did several podcasts including a conversation with Augustin from Weglot, Silvana Pop as a first timer at WordCamp, a Woo BizChat with Robert Windisch and Vito Peleg, some talk on SEO with Maireke van de Rakt, and more talks with Milan Ivanovic, Daugirdas Junkus, Boggie Yanishen and David Mainayar.\nAs you can see I and several of my co-hosts were busy during the event. In hindsight I have learned podcasting is tough at live events. The most challenging part is carving into someone else's schedule. Also, I ended up missed a lot of opportunities to meet new people and catch up with old friends.\nThis year at WordCamp Europe\nOf course as a media partner, we will be covering the event in many ways. And you can expect some podcasts as well. Whenever I attend a flagship WordCamp, I will spread the good news, media partner or not.\nBut more importantly I want to meet as many of you as possible. Instead of scheduling times, I will be spending most of my time in the sponsor area. I may even tweet out if I'm hanging at one of our own Do the Woo sponsor booths. So please make sure and say hi and always happy to have a bit of a chat.\nAnd if you haven't gotten your ticket for this amazing event in Athens Greece, you can do that here.\nHope to see you there!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThanks to our Pod Friends for their support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\u2190 Previous PostNext Post \u2192\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPodcast\nWooBits\nBlog\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nDev Resources\nBuilder Meetup\nDo the Woo News\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to WooBits\nSponsor\nChangelog\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPartners\nContact\nAbout\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMenu \nHome\nPrivacy Policy\nDisclaimer\nTerms of Service\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDotheWoo.io does not have any affiliate links.
