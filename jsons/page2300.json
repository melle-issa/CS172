Its intent is to provide prospective students and their parents with a statistic of comparable effectiveness that can be used in determining college choice. USC\u2019s current graduation rate is based on full-time, first-time, degree-seeking undergraduates who entered the university in the fall semester and graduated within six years of attendance (150% of the normal completion time). Graduation rates do not include students who left school to serve in the armed forces or on official church missions or with a foreign aid service of the federal government, or students who died or were totally and permanently disabled.\n\nUSC\u2019s U-CAN Profile\nThe University and College Accountability Network (U-CAN) Web site provides profiles of hundreds of private institutions of higher learning, in a common format, with the goal of helping parents and prospective students make an informed college choice.
