From Disneyland to scenic beaches, nearby attractions are among the many reasons students decide to attend Chapman.\n\u201cWhen I first toured Chapman, I fell in love with the campus and town,\u201d says Belana Beeck \u201920 (MFA \u201923). \u201cThe energy and calmness of the area felt so homey. I could see myself getting coffee at the Plaza between classes or taking daily walks through the cute neighborhood.\u201d\u00a0\nChapman students can find fun activities within easy walking distance of campus, plus campus shuttles and the Orange Transportation Center help students explore more widely in Southern California.\nHere, Beeck shares her top 10 things to do in and around Orange:\nFind Your Bliss at Plaza Park\u00a0\n\nIn the middle of Old Towne Orange is the historic Plaza, voted one of the Great Places in America for 2018 by the American Planning Association. Dating to 1880, the Plaza is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It\u2019s a great place to people-watch and get inspiration. The fountain and the life it attracts provide a sense of serenity that students appreciate.\u00a0\n\u201cI loved it when one of my creative writing professors decided to hold class by the fountain. It made for a really relaxing place to learn and write,\u201d Beeck says.\nThe Plaza also plays host to festive events, such as the Orange International Street Fair, Treats in the Streets, a menorah lighting and a Holiday Tree Lighting Ceremony.\nEnjoy the Vibe in Old Towne Orange\n\nOld Towne Orange has something for everyone. From plant stores to quirky boutiques, coffee shops to unique restaurants, the area seems modeled on the quintessential college town.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI recommend Pandor Artisan Bakery and Caf\u00e9 and the new restaurant Bosscat Kitchen and Libations, an awesome themed restaurant that used to be a car shop,\u201d Beeck says. \u201cOld Towne is always adding new places, so you never run out of new things to try. I can sit with friends for hours, forgetting about time and simply enjoying each other\u2019s company while eating the best avocado toast I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\u00a0\nOther student favorites in the Plaza area are Urth Caff\u00e9, Philz Coffee, Blue Bowl, the Filling Station Cafe, Thai Towne Eatery, Rutabegorz, The Pizza Press, Watson\u2019s Soda Fountain & Cafe and The Pie Hole.\u00a0\nChapman students get discounts for many of these restaurants and shops. Most of the restaurants will give a 10-15% discount, and many clothing shops offer 10-20% off. Just show your Chapman ID!\u00a0\u00a0\nGo to Disneyland and Universal Studios\n\nDisneyland, California Adventure and the Downtown Disney shopping and dining area are just 15 minutes from campus. Students visit for a whole day or just for a quick stop between classes.\u00a0\n\u201cDisneyland and California Adventure are great places to have fun and temporarily forget about your responsibilities,\u201d Beeck says.\u00a0\nEven without paying for an annual pass, students can visit Downtown Disney or the Anaheim GardenWalk for the shops, restaurants and sights.\u00a0\nIf you\u2019re more of a thrillseeker than a Disney fan, Universal Studios may be the place for you. It\u2019s full of adventure rides, shows and, in the fall, spooky attractions.\u00a0\nChapman students can visit Universal Studios at a discounted rate by visiting this page.\nTake in a Game at Angel Stadium\u00a0\n\nAlso in Anaheim is Angel Stadium, home of the Los Angeles Angels.\u00a0\nIn addition to baseball games, Angel Stadium plays host to many other events, from food festivals to art fairs and Bubble Run, where you can run through bubbles and foam.\u00a0\nTry it All at the Anaheim Packing District\nAnother popular spot is the Anaheim Packing District: Food Hall, \u201ca walkable culinary collection of 50 artisans.\u201d The Packing District offers indoor and outdoor dining as well as takeout from eateries such as Adya, with its fresh Indian flavors and Fish & Chips for comfort food.\nGo on an Adventure With a Local Hike\n\nOrange County is home to the Santa Ana Mountains, where hikers can enjoy hidden waterfalls, breathtaking sunsets and trails for every skill level. Popular hikes include Peters Canyon Lake View and East Ridge Loops, Santiago Oaks Trail and Bobcat Meadow Trail.\u00a0\nScenic coastal hikes also abound. Favored destinations include Crystal Cove State Park and Upper Newport Bay Nature Preserve.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nVisit One of the Nearby Beaches\n\nWorld-class SoCal beaches are known for their surfing spots and secret coves. Laguna Beach, Balboa Island, Corona del Mar, Newport Beach and Huntington Beach are great beach towns to visit.\u00a0\n\u201cThe beach is the perfect place to take long walks and enjoy the sunrise or sunset.\u201d Beeck says. \u201cThrough Chapman\u2019s Greek life, I was able to build relationships and make lifelong memories with friends when we would plan beach cleanups and fun hangouts there.\u201d\u00a0\nWhile visiting the coast, Chapman students can go whale watching in Newport Beach at a half-off rate of $18 by entering \u201c18whalecruises\u201d in the voucher box on the last page of checkout.\nDiscover the Unexpected The LAB Anti-Mall\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a different type of mall experience, you will love the LAB, also known as \u201cLittle American Business.\u201d The LAB\u2019s mission is to combat retail monotony by recognizing the \u201cneed for an original, indoor-outdoor unconventional hangout,\u201d its website says.\u00a0\nThis vibrant community is perfect for fashion gurus and those who want to try new and exciting food options like Habana, The Den and, for dessert, Good Town Donuts. Music and art lovers will also find Creme Tangerine Records and The Artery fun spots to shop.\u00a0\nShop Sustainably at Orange\u2019s Thrift and Music Stores\n\nIf you love hidden treasures, you\u2019ll find that Orange is a haven for all things retro. Shop for amazing furniture and decor to enhance your space, as well as out-of-print and vintage CDs and vinyl. Nearby you\u2019ll find Plato\u2019s Closet, where you can buy, sell and trade items.\nGet Some Culture on the Chapman Campus\n\nChapman University loves to celebrate art in all its forms. The campus plays host to several renowned sculptures, such as\u00a0 \u201cLevitation of the Enchanted Princess\u201d near Irvine Lecture Hall.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nCheck out a fragment of the Berlin Wall, located in Liberty Plaza near Roosevelt Hall. This majestic piece of history is surrounded by hedges, providing an artful space for students who want a quiet moment between classes.\u00a0\nThe Hilbert Museum of California Art focuses on California Scene paintings, featuring an extensive collection of oils, watercolors and sketches capturing what everyday life was like in California, starting in the 1920s. Find more information on the museum here.\nThe Guggenheim Gallery exhibits art by students and community arts organizations as well as established artists. The gallery strives to display contemporary art that expresses a critical, ethical and moral view of the world.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nHannah Montante \u201920 (MFA \u201922) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the Dates for the 2021-22 Season of Town & Gown\u2019s Lunch at the Forum Series\n\n\n\n\n\nFounder of Homeboy Industries Father Gregory Boyle to Speak at Chapman University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership That Spans the Campus Jack of all trades Kyle Tanimura is leaving quite the lasting mark on Chapman, where he has taken on multiple leadership roles as a double major in political science and strategic and corporate communication, with a...\n\n\nMay 1, 2023 Jennifer Winfield\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Pacific Islander Desi American Heritage Month Events at Chapman University Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Heritage Month, which runs from May 1 to 31, celebrates the identities, histories and experiences of the APIDA community.
