(19 April)\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s new in GutenbergGutenberg The Gutenberg project is the new Editor Interface for WordPress. The editor improves the process and experience of creating new content, making writing rich content much simpler. It uses \u2018blocks\u2019 to add richness rather than shortcodes, custom HTML etc. https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/\u2026\u201d posts (labeled with the #gutenberg-new tag) are posted following every Gutenberg release on a biweekly basis, showcasing new features included in each release. As a reminder, here\u2019s an overview of different ways to keep up with Gutenberg and the Site Editor project (formerly called Full Site Editing).\nGutenberg 15.6 has been released and is available for download!\u00a0\nThe latest version of the Gutenberg pluginPlugin A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party includes small quality of life enhancements and many bugbug A bug is an error or unexpected result.

The new experimental Details blockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. is introduced early for community feedback, and more presets come to coreCore Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress. blocks for spacing and border controls. In the Site Editor, a theme\u2019s style variations are now also available in the left sidebarSidebar A sidebar in WordPress is referred to a widget-ready area used by WordPress themes to display information that is not a part of the main content. It is not always a vertical column on the side. It can be a horizontal rectangle below or above the content area, footer, header, or any where in the theme. to enable faster updates. Gutenberg 15.6 includes a total of 112 PRs, authored by 45 contributors, 7 of which were new contributors! \nDetails block, experimental\nSpacer Block gets spacing presets\nStyle variations in browse mode\nOther notable highlights\nChangelog\nContributors\nDetails block, experimental\nOccasionally, you want to hide content until the reader is ready to receive it. This could be spoiler content in a movie review, the transcript of a podcast episode, or a video recording in a blogblog (versus network, site) post. With the new Details block, you can now publish hidden content that opens with a click on the arrow. It\u2019s the first version of the block, and it is behind an experimental feature flag. To test this new functionality, visit Gutenberg \u2192 Experiments screen in the WordPress adminadmin (and super admin) and enable the Details block option. This block is still being worked on, and it might change before coming out of experiments. Feedback is encouraged.\nSpacer Block gets spacing presets\nSpacing presets were added to Dimension controls in WordPress 6.1 to make controlling space in a theme easier and provide a simplified user experience. This functionality also allows theme developers to employ fluid spacing.\u00a0\nSince the introduction of spacing presets, it became clear from community feedback that spacing presets should also be available for the Height control in the Spacer block. This enhancementenhancement Enhancements are simple improvements to WordPress, such as the addition of a hook, a new feature, or an improvement to an existing feature. in 15.6 gives theme developers much more flexibility over how spacing is applied throughout a site and enables fluid Spacer blocks!\u00a0\nHere\u2019s a quick example of what fluid spacing presets might look like when defined in theme.jsonJSON JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a minimal, readable format for structuring data. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML. using clamp(). You can learn more about fluid spacing and typography in the article Intrinsic design, theming, and rethinking how to design with WordPress over on the WordPress Developer Blog.\n{\n\t\"$schema\": \"https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json\",\n\t\"version\": 2,\n\t\"settings\": {\n\t\t\"spacing\": {\n\t\t\t\"spacingScale\": {\n\t\t\t\t\"steps\": 0\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"spacingSizes\": [\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"size\": \"clamp(1.5rem, 5vw, 2rem)\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"slug\": \"30\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"1\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"size\": \"clamp(1.8rem, 1.8rem + ((1vw - 0.48rem) * 2.885), 3rem)\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"slug\": \"40\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"2\"\n\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\"size\": \"clamp(2.5rem, 8vw, 4.5rem)\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"slug\": \"50\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"3\"\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\nStyle variations in browse mode\nWith Gutenberg 15.6, the theme\u2019s style variations are now accessible from the left menu in the Site Editor, together with templates, template parts, and navigation menuNavigation Menu A theme feature introduced with Version 3.0. WordPress includes an easy to use mechanism for giving various control options to get users to click from one place to another on a site. items. This change makes it easier to access style variations and pick your favorite. Clicking \u201cEdit style\u201d opens the editor with the Styles panel active, providing quick access to the additional style controls like typography and color.\nOther notable highlights\nWith 15.6, the Cover block includes all border-related design tools. This was a much-requested enhancement by theme developers, which reduces the need for custom block styling.\u00a0\u00a0\nNow, when the Global Styles panel is open in the Site Editor, clicking on any block in the canvas will automatically open the design tools for the corresponding block in the Styles panel. This enhancement will help speed up your workflow and provide fast access to design tools.\nThree more visual inconsistencies were smoothened. The visualizer that shows padding and margin changes around blocks now works consistently for larger numbers. In the List View, you can now successfully drop blocks below a Group block, and the Drop Zone in the canvas now has smoother animation.\u00a0\nChangelog\nEnhancements\nBlock Library\nA margin option is added to the Embedded preview block.
