It is an estimate designed to help you plan for the upcoming academic year and is for informational purposes only. Your actual cost of attendance will vary based on the individual decisions you make.Your cost of attendance includes both direct expenses payable to Chico State and indirect expenses that are not payable to Chico State. Your actual cost of attending Chico State may be lower if you budget wisely and keep your indirect expenses to a minimum. Students can reduce expenses by having roommates, eating out less frequently, and commuting to campus by foot, bike or public transportation.To get a more realistic and well-rounded perspective on your Chico State cost of attendance, compare it to the costs of attendance at other colleges. You may discover that the cost of living in Chico is more affordable than in many other college towns.The estimated budgets below represent a moderate standard of living, or Cost of Attendance, for full-time students attending Chico State.\u00a0Budgets are for a nine\u2013month academic year.

At Chico State, the student budget is based on the estimated cost of a typical student's tuition fees, books and supplies, food and housing, transportation, and personal expenses for a nine\u2013month academic year (fall and spring semesters). The COA will vary depending on:where you live: on or off campus, or with your parentswhether you are an undergraduate, graduate, or credential studentwhether you are enrolled at least half-time or less than half-timeKnowing the Cost of Attendance is important because the budget helps determine your Financial Need and your financial aid award. Financial Need is defined as the difference between your Expected Family Contribution and the standard Cost of Attendance calculated for each academic year. This is an important point of comparison between colleges.Net Price CalculatorUse the Net Price Calculator to receive a rough estimate of your eligibility for grants and need-based loans. This calculator assists you in estimating your costs after taking into account your need-based financial aid eligibility. See our Net Price Calculator webpage for more information.\u00a0Exceptional Circumstances AppealIf you have additional expenses, such as childcare, out-of-town educationally related travel, or non-reimbursed medical expenses you may want to consider submitting an Exceptional Circumstances Appeal. In most cases increasing the cost of attendance will result in additional loans.Videos for ParentsSee our video library for lots of other helpful financial aid videos!On-Campus Living Expenses (food/housing)The above on-campus food and housing rates are averages and are used by the Financial Aid & Scholarship Office for the purpose of packaging financial aid. Actual on-campus food and housing rates are available at University Housing.AB990 Information (average cost of a one bedroom apartment around the Chico State campus)The average cost to rent a one bedroom apartment within the areas surrounding the Chico State campus is $857. This information is updated yearly on February 1st. It is important to understand the above average cost is for rent only and does not include cost of food, utilities, garbage, rental deposit, and other necessary expenses to rent an apartment.Our Off-Campus cost of attendance for food and housing is an average amount for a 9-month period. Most students usually share an apartment to reduce their cost of food and housing.For more information about off-campus housing and services provided by the university for students living off-campus, see Off Campus Student Services.For additional information on how Cost of Attendance helps determine your financial aid award, see Understanding Your Award.Disclaimer: The CSU makes every effort to keep student costs to a minimum. Fees listed in published schedules or student accounts may need to be increased when public funding is inadequate. Therefore, CSU must reserve the right, even after fees are initially charged or initial fee payments are made, to increase or modify any listed fees. All listed fees, other than mandatory systemwide fees, are subject to change without notice, until the date when instruction for a particular semester or quarter has begun. All CSU listed fees should be regarded as estimates that are subject to change upon approval by the Board of Trustees, the Chancellor, or the Presidents, as appropriate. Changes in mandatory systemwide fees will be made in accordance with the requirements of the Working Families Student Fee Transparency and Accountability Act (Sections 66028 - 66028.6 of the Education Code).For an estimated moderate standard of living budget, please refer to the Chico State Cost of Attendance.Vice President for Student AffairsKendall Hall, Room 110530-898-6131www.csuchico.edu/saDivision of Student AffairsAccessibility Resource CenterAssociated StudentsBasic Needs ProjectCareer CenterEquity, Diversity & InclusionEarly Outreach & Support ProgramsEnrollment Management\u00a0ServicesFinancial Aid & ScholarshipsIntercollegiate AthleticsOff-Campus Student ServicesStudent Conduct, Rights & ResponsibilitiesStudent Life & LeadershipUniversity HousingWellCat Services\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus.
