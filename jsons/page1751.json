The site offers a database of speakers that is free to join and free to search.\nWhen speakers sign up, they include a bio, headshot, location, languages they speak, topics, expertise, and contact information. They can also specify if they identify being from an underrepresented group. In the short amount of time the site has been live, WP Speakers has added 149 registered speakers who are ready and willing to share their WordPress knowledge at both virtual and in-person events.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs a meetup organizer for my local WordPress meetup, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m constantly searching for speakers to present,\u201d Frechette said. \u201cOn one hand the pandemic made it harder to keep coming up with fresh meetup content, but on the other hand, it allowed me to connect to speakers globally as all of our meetings were moved online. But even with all of the speakers in the world now able to present, it was still hard to think of topics and then source speakers. As well-connected as I am in WordPress, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even imagine how much more difficult it might be for someone who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know a lot of speakers personally. So WP Speakers was born.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFrechette has a knack for bringing people together and helping them find their place in WordPress. In addition to her open source contributions, she maintains WPCareerPages.com, a site that connects job seekers with WordPress companies, and publishes a weekly tweet thread with available positions.\nFrechette is supporting her efforts on the project through sponsorship funds, which allow her to keep the resource free.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to me that the ability to belong on the site as well as be able to search for speakers always remains free,\u201d she said. \u201cThat way no one is denied from being able to participate. A resource like this should be available to all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFrechette plans to continue adding to the speaker resource page and an event organizer resource page is next on the roadmap. Anyone who wants to be listed on the site can fill out the \u201cJoin As a Speaker\u00e2\u0080\u009d form and new profiles will be approved in 1-3 business days.\n\nby Sarah Gooding at May 02, 2023 03:29 AM under News\n\n\nMay 01, 2023\nWPTavern: Priced Out of API Access: Jetpack and WordPress.com Discontinue Support for Twitter Auto-Sharing\n\n\nJetpack and WordPress.com announced they will no longer support the Twitter API in their products. Last month Twitter suspended WordPress.com\u2019s access to its API, which broke Jetpack Social Sharing \u2013 the mechanism that auto-tweets published posts. \nAlthough WordPress.com\u2019s access to the API was reinstated for a few weeks, the company has now been priced out of offering features that rely on Twitter\u2019s API:\n\nTwitter recently notified Automattic that it was dramatically changing the terms and pricing of the Twitter API. The cost increase is prohibitive for us to absorb without passing a significant price increase along to you, and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see that as an option. We have attempted to negotiate a path forward, but haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been able to reach an agreement in time for Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s May 1 cutoff.\u00c2\u00a0\nGiven that, we have decided to discontinue using the Twitter API.\n\nWordPress.com did not detail its estimated API usage, but Enterprise access starts at $42,000/month for 50 million tweets and scales upwards based on usage, with 100 million tweets priced at $125,000/month and 200 million priced at $210,000 per month. This astronomical price increase will swiftly cull many applications, institutions, and large scale publishers that don\u2019t have an extra $500k/year \u2013 $2.5M/year in the budget for Twitter API access.\nIn October 2022, Jetpack started monetizing this feature with a paid plan that limited the free version to 30 social shares per month (to any social network), a controversial decision that sent many users in search of alternatives. Passing the cost to the customer here was already beyond what most users wanted to pay for these features and is not sustainable.\nWordPress.com will be removing Twitter from Jetpack Social and refocusing its efforts on other social media sharing capabilities. The company is adding Instagram and Mastodon to its auto-sharing lineup soon. Auto-sharing for Tumblr, Facebook, and LinkedIn still works. \nStarting, today, users who want to share their published posts on Twitter will need to share the link manually through the Twitter app. For clarification, sharing posts by clicking the Tweet button will continue working. This change only affects auto-sharing.\nThe massive increase in API pricing has competitors fired up to support users migrating away from Twitter. Automattic, which also owns Tumblr, took a stab at Twitter in the conclusion of the announcement: \u201cIf your recent experiences with Twitter have left you dissatisfied,\u00c2\u00a0go take Tumblr for a spin\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 we hear it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite a party over there.\u201d\nIn February, Mastodon promised that the platform would never charge for API access. After Automattic\u2019s announcement today, Mastodon tweeted they are excited to see the company expanding support for the platform in Jetpack.\n\nMany of Twitter's most recognizable features were invented in third-party apps, and we're thrilled to see what those developers are now doing with Mastodon. Powered by open source, we can promise: Mastodon will never charge for API access!\u2014 Mastodon (@Mastodon@mastodon.social) (@joinmastodon) February 3, 2023\n\nTwitter may be shooting itself in the foot by making it more costly, in terms of time and automation, to have incoming content from the open web. It\u2019s becoming more cumbersome for publishers to share their content. This has further aggravated Twitter\u2019s user base who is used to coming to the platform for up-to-the-minute news. Too many smaller apps are now priced out of providing these kinds of updates. Some users have started encouraging their followers to follow them on other networks to be alerted when posts are published.\n\u201cThis is an example of the minor annoyances that will ultimately make people look for alternatives to Twitter,\u201d WordPress.com user @MoviesSilently said. \u201cFrictionless sharing isn\u2019t a make or break but it\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\nI guess I need to go fire up my Tumblr account again or make a new one, and possibly see what Mastadon is all about. I'm not getting any reach on Twitter anyway.\u2014 MUDPIX OUTDOORS (@mudpiix) April 29, 2023\n\nToday\u2019s news has added to users\u2019 compounding disappointment with Twitter. Not only has it is become more costly to have an active voice but advertising has a stranglehold on the feed. As major brands have ceased advertising on the platform, the quality of ads has declined to where scrolling the app has become like wading through a flea market. Twitter users may soon be in for more changes to their feeds as any content originating from WordPress.com or Jetpack-powered sites will require a manual share to be found on the platform.\n\nby Sarah Gooding at May 01, 2023 10:41 PM under twitter\n\n\nApril 30, 2023\nWordPress.org blog: People of WordPress: Monika Rao\n\n\nThis month we feature Monika Rao, a Product and Quality Assurance Manager from India. She finds contributing to the WordPress project a way to deepen her technical skills and further her web career.\nThe\u00a0People of WordPress\u00a0series shares inspiring stories of how people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives can change for the better through WordPress and its global community of contributors.\n\nMonika was born in Udaipur, in the state of Rajasthan, India. At that time, she recalls, there was some resistance to girls\u2019 education in certain subjects. Thanks to her parents\u2019 support and encouragement, she graduated in Computer Science Engineering. Following graduation, she went on to work for an international firm. However, she felt she wanted to work in her home area and so returned to work for a firm based in Udaipur itself.\nMonika started her career journey with WordPress in 2015, and was fascinated as she learnt more of the technology. A few years later, she moved into a\u00a0 role as a WordPress Quality Analyst, enabling her to dive further into the software. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom that moment, I decided to make it an integral part of my ever-learning professional career,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\nThe more Monika researched WordPress, the more she found it was not just a tool to simplify website building but also a platform where you could \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeet new people, share your thoughts, learn from them and improve yourself through the process.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWhen she first started working with WordPress, she found she had many questions, ranging from what are themes and plugins to what is a WordCamp. As her knowledge grew, she knew one day she wanted to be able to contribute to both the code and the community supporting it.\nBecoming part of WordPress\nMonika started contributing to WordPress in 2015 with Theme Review. In this area, she was able to work alongside WordPress code experts and, at the same time, learn the concepts of theme development. She saw this as a great opportunity to learn and improve her development skills.\u00a0\nShe was also very interested in testing from the beginning, so she started contributing to Core. Her first contribution was to the WordPress 4.7 release in 2016. She remembers the day she first saw her name in the WordPress contributor list. This encouraged her to make more contributions including to core and the community team, and each time she felt more like part of the community.\nThus inspired, Monika delved into making the software more easily available in her native Hindi language through joining other contributors to the Polyglots team. She went on to become a General Translation Editor for the Hindi language, and has continued to contribute in this area.\nMonika and other panelists at WordCamp Udaipur 2017\n\n\n\nAs she became involved with the WordPress community, she looked for ways of sharing it with others in her home city. In 2017 she was part of the organizing team for WordCamp Udaipur 2017 and there shared her contributing journey with others. This was her first WordCamp, and she describes the experience as \u00e2\u0080\u0098superb\u00e2\u0080\u0099. It enabled her to connect to both those new to WordPress and those already working with it. \n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a great moment for me speaking in front of hundreds of people and everyone cherished my journey. It inspired me to continue my contribution to other teams too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nMonika Rao\nShe went on to be an organizer for WordCamp Udaipur 2018 and WordCamp India 2021. She also contributes to the Meta and Theme review teams. \nContributing to WordPress software releases\n2019 was a big year for Monika. She got married and joined a new firm where she could work more on WordPress, learning about marketing and design.\nIn November 2019, the WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden put out a call for an all-women and non-binary release squad. Monika said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always felt that not enough women take part in WordPress, so I decided to jump in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She took on the role of Test Lead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a wonderful journey\u00e2\u0080\u0094 worth every second and this was a proud moment for me when I saw my name on the WordPress Noteworthy list. You feel proud when you see your small contributions in use by 40 per cent of the web.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMonika Rao\nMonika was part of the notable contributors for the WordPress 5.6 release\n\n\n\nAs a Test Lead, her priority was ensuring the release would be stable and, more importantly, ready for production sites. To effectively manage all the testing, test scrubs were run weekly, highlighting the key testing areas to help get the entire team involved. The scrubs also played an important role in picking up tickets needing immediate resolution.Monika also continued her role in the WordPress 5.7 release, and focused more on the core software. She believes being part of the Core and Test teams is a good way to watch and learn, as well as take part in the different elements that make up a release.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSkills you have will eventually fade away unless you work on them and sharpen them. So don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t underestimate the value of any skill. It will eventually help you somehow in your career.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMonika Rao\nShe added: \u201cI owe my skills and knowledge to WordPress and its lovely community. The best part about this platform is that it is free and provides ample opportunities to improve your skills and build a career. The wider WordPress community is highly supportive, and it provides numerous additional resources, such as online forums, tutorials, and meetups, to help people learn and grow. With the help of WordPress, anyone can learn how to create websites, develop plugins, and contribute to the community.\u201d\nThis route for learning has helped Monika in choosing the direction of her career and in keeping her skills up-to-date. In October 2021, she joined a company specializing in producing WordPress plugins and services for online businesses.\nEveryone can contribute to WordPress\nMonika pictured during her travels\n\n\n\nMonika is determined more people, especially other women, have opportunities to contribute to open source in general. \n\n\u201cMany people are using WordPress, but they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all know about contribution. Therefore, my future goal is to help people, especially women, contribute more to WordPress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMonika Rao\n\u201cWhen I first started contributing to WordPress, I thought that being from a testing background, I may not be able to contribute much. However, I soon realized that there are various different areas where I could easily contribute and develop my skills,\u201d said Monika.\n\u201cSo, I would encourage anyone who is interested in contributing to WordPress to find their own area of interest, regardless of their background, be it marketing, content writing, designing, or any other field. The WordPress community welcomes contributions from people of all backgrounds and skill-sets. So, don\u2019t hesitate to dive in and contribute in a way that suits your interests and skills.\u201d\nShare the stories\nHelp share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community.\u00a0Meet more WordPressers in the\u00a0People of WordPress series.\nContributors\nThanks to Monika Rao (@monikarao) for sharing her adventures in open source.\nThank you to Abha Thakor (@webcommsat) and the late Surendra Thakor (@sthakor) for interviews and writing this feature, and to Meher Bala (@meher), Chloe Bringmann (@cbringmann), Mary Baum (@marybaum) for work on photographs and review.\nThe\u00a0People of WordPress\u00a0series thanks Josepha Haden (@chanthaboune) and Topher DeRosia (@topher1kenobe) for their support.\n\nThis People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on\u00c2\u00a0HeroPress.com, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

The system, the mindset, and the approach have been around for so long now and have been a part of the core development \u00e2\u0080\u0093 after all, we are through phase two and starting phase three, Collaboration.

The table showcases 108 of the most popular free plugins on WordPress.org.\nTen years ago Birchler created a website that showed the most popular plugins in a similar table layout, ranking them by number of active installations. This chart has been updated and is now available at plugintable.com.\n\u201cToday, I am actually \u2018re-introducing\u2019 this project, complete with a modernized look and feel, more curation, and more useful information than before,\u201d Birchler said.\n\nThe website is interactive, so cards can be expanded to see more information about each plugin, including the author, install count, star rating, and the date it was first published.\n\nApproximately 57% of the plugins included have 1 million or more installs, so it gives you a chance to see all of the most successful WordPress.org extensions at a glance. 600k is the lowest number of active installs for plugins included in the chart.\nAfter making the chart, Birchler noted that he was impressed by the stats for the Really Simple SSL plugin, which has more than 5 million active installs and a 5/5-star rating. He also highlighted Site Kit by Google as being the youngest \u201celement\u201d first released in October 2019, with 3+ million active installs in just over three years in the directory. The XML Sitemaps Generator plugin is the oldest among those included, released in 2005 just before Akismet. \n\u201cAnother plugin that has caught my eye is WP Multibyte Patch by @eastcoder, which offers improvements for Japanese sites,\u201d Birchler said. \u201cWith over 1+ million installs it makes me wonder why WordPress core itself doesn\u2019t have better support for multibyte characters.\u201d\nIf you like the Period Table of WordPress Plugins and want to see it hanging on your wall, Birchler has set up a Shopify-powered store where you can purchase a high-quality print version. The poster comes in light and dark modes and is also available framed. He plans to donate the proceeds of the store to the WordPress community.\n\nby Sarah Gooding at April 29, 2023 03:51 AM under Plugins\n\n\nWPTavern: Big Bite Launches 2023 Enterprise WordPress Survey\n\n\nBig Bite, a UK-based enterprise WordPress agency, has launched a new survey called State of Enterprise WordPress to gather data and insights on how the platform can best serve large-scale brands.\nThe survey takes approximately 5-7 minutes to complete and covers budgets,publishing processes, platform strengths, user frustrations, custom functionality, infrastructure, architecture, and ongoing maintenance. It also attempts to gauge whether enterprise users have embraced the block editor and what other CMS\u2019s the organization is using in addition to WordPress.\n\u201cThis particular survey is focused on brands that are using WordPress, in any part of their estate,\u201d Big Bite CEO Iain McPherson said. \u201cMaybe it could be a small blog, powering an intranet or a large publishing site. I want to understand why and how they are using WordPress, but then drill down into other valuable metrics such as team size and budgets.\u201d\nThe survey will be used to create a new report that summarizes the findings from enterprise organizations. McPherson said if the report is well received in the WordPress community, his team may continue publishing the State of Enterprise WordPress on an annual basis.\nThe survey most directly applies to the people who are responsible for the enterprise organization\u2019s website, as opposed to the business owners. \n\u201cWe find with companies of these sizes; multiple people are managing their WordPress products,\u201d McPherson said. \u201cAlso, multiple respondents from the same company is totally OK, too.\n\u201cThis is one of a couple of initiatives I am working on to raise the brand awareness of Big Bite, but more importantly, show that WordPress should be considered as an enterprise CMS.\u201d\nAccording to W3Techs, WordPress\u2019 current CMS market share is at 63.3% of all the websites where a CMS can be detected. Enterprise organizations help keep this market growing, so insights about how they are using WordPress and their particular pain points could be helpful in developing solutions that benefit this segment. Data from the survey will be aggregated and anonymized and will not be attributed to the respondent or the organization.\n\nby Sarah Gooding at April 29, 2023 12:36 AM under News\n\n\nApril 28, 2023\nDo The Woo Community: BobWP Talks About WPSpeakers.com on the Friday Show\n\n\nRecently Michelle Freschette launched WPSpeakers.com.

The time and schedule have not yet been announced but registration is open.\nAttendees can expect to see demos of Human Made\u2019s current AI projects and highlights of what others are doing in the space. The organizers plan to discuss the impact AI will have on the WordPress industry and share predictions and insights.\nHuman Made is among a few WordPress product makers that have been experimenting with Gutenberg-native AI block and content assistants. CTO Joe Hoyle published several videos demonstrating how prompts can work across various blocks with AI natively integrated into the block editor. His prototypes have progressed with the addition of Content Streaming that renders content, blocks, and layout in real time. Users can also cancel the streaming output while it\u2019s in progress to refine the guidance given to the AI.\n\nWe've made some progress on the WordPress Gutenberg AI integration.

They share their experiences, including the challenges they faced and lessons learned. They also give advice to entrepreneurs and business owners looking to grow and sell their own WordPress companies. \n\nEstimated Reading Time:  30 minutes\n\nTranscript \u00e2\u0086\u0093\nKim Lipari, owner and CEO of Valet, talks with Cory Miller about their insights and experiences on entrepreneurship, including how to handle challenges, the importance of building relationships, and the role of vulnerability in leadership. They offer advice on building a successful WordPress business and emphasize the need for continuous learning and personal growth. Overall, this episode provides valuable insights and advice for anyone interested in entrepreneurship and building a successful WordPress-based business.\nTop Takeaways:\n\nOutsourcing Infrastructure. WordPress hosting companies can benefit from outsourcing their infrastructure to specialized providers such as WP Cloud. This can free up their customer support team from dealing with infrastructure-related issues and enable them to focus on providing better customer service and value-added services.\nIncrease Customer Satisfaction. By democratizing publishing and providing a superior WordPress experience, hosting companies can reduce churn and retain customers who may otherwise switch to other platforms if their WordPress experience is subpar.\nSet Up for Speed. While many factors can impact website speed, some of the most important ones include optimizing images, using a content delivery network (CDN), and minimizing the use of plugins. By focusing on these areas, WordPress agencies can help their clients improve their website speed and ultimately provide a better user experience for their visitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n Sponsor: Pagely\nTop-Tier Managed WordPress hosting solutions for Enterprise, the Public Sector, and Media companies.

Welcome back to Post Status Draft. This is part of our agency series, and I\u2019m talking to a longtime friend and an awesome agency owner in the space, Kimberly Lepar of Valet Fame. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWe\u2019re gonna be talking about, um, The role in the changing value of websites to organizations. Um, Vale\u2019s been around so long and has so much experience and just diving into that with Kimberly is gonna be really, really exciting for me because updating her knowledge for how websites and their role, uh, in the world and businesses and organizations, she\u2019s got a front seat view to that with her team, what they do for their clients. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd we\u2019re gonna talk about, um, some of those elements that, um, an organization should. Outsource stick to their core competency and outsource. But before we get all of that, we\u2019re gonna have a fun conversation talking about where websites sit today in the market, on the internet, their value and role, and no better person to talk about that than Kimberly. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo Kimberly, would you mind sharing a little bit about [00:01:00] yourself and what you do at ballet?\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Yeah, absolutely. First of all, thanks for having me. It\u2019s always a pleasure. I . Love hanging out and having conversations like this. I think they\u2019re so important. Um, and I am the owner of valet.io. We offer comprehensive end-to-end website management services for businesses that wanna have a strong brand presence, um, want to make sure they\u2019re communicating themselves well online and need a team to support them so that they can focus on the things that they do best every day. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Gosh, you\u2019re awesome. I, I\u2019m gonna come back to the end to end because I think that\u2019s one of the compelling parts of this conversation too. All that you do health. And then having a, a firm, an agency, a partner really that can do so much for the website. Um, but Okay, let\u2019s dive in. So we\u2019ve been talking about this for a couple of months now, but I saw you posted on LinkedIn and I\u2019ll put those in the show notes. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThat post, I think it was so timely and so [00:02:00] good. I\u2019ve been kind of updating my view about all this. Mm-hmm. And you know, in the old days, Websites for these, like, and I find myself still referring to him like they\u2019re, they\u2019re a brochure at the base. Mm-hmm. A 24 7, 365 days, a, a year where your clients can go in and kind of check out what you do, but your post really illuminated something that\u2019s all evolved and changed as the world has changed and business. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd, um, what are you seeing there? Um, with the changing value and importance and focus on websites for business and organizations that you serve.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Well, I think namely the, the chief change is that Gone is the, uh, my business at webmaster email address, uh, that used to be, uh, the sole, uh, provider and contact point for what websites were for a lot of companies. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUh, they were kind of these closed off boxes where only, you know, two people could edit the HTML and, [00:03:00] and change things up. So, um, from that, And you say the olden days, which it feels like that, but I think maybe even just in the past, I don\u2019t know, probably five, five years or so, it, it\u2019s escalated very quickly to become, uh, that the website is important to the CEO, uh, for one reason or another, probably more for. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, brand identity so that, you know, how are we putting our best space forward, right? These, uh, very broad, uh, strokes of what the business means. Uh, it\u2019s important to marketing, uh, to make sure that they are communicating the services effectively, that there\u2019s good copy, good, uh, interaction, uh, social integrations, right? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIt\u2019s also important to, uh, sales managers and even, um, other line level employees. Um, and other parts of the business to be able to share what they\u2019re doing or provide. PDFs, white papers, all kinds of registrations. I mean, all those [00:04:00] different things. So it\u2019s become a very, uh, Uh, crowdsourced, um, important piece of, of a business. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd so that\u2019s changed a lot. It\u2019s no longer one person kind of holding the keys that can understand. It\u2019s now really commonplace for everybody in a business to, to think of the website in a different way with a different sort of use for the role that they play.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: One of the things that strikes me from what you\u2019re saying in our discussions in the past, particularly with your, your clients and what you see is this, when you said webmaster, it\u2019s this thought of a supplemental thing, like an a, almost an afterthought that websites were once mm-hmm. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThought of now to be in very integral to everything the business and organization does. Um, I remember talking with some of your, About some of your clients that you all work with and, and you, you had an interesting way to say it. You\u2019re like, maybe they weren\u2019t straight on e-commerce, so at Ithe or post status for [00:05:00] instance. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, you know, that was, that was it like, yeah. If, if the website\u2019s down we\u2019re not making money, you know? Mm-hmm. But you\u2019re seeing a multifaceted, uh, approach now where it\u2019s not just an afterthought and supplemental, it\u2019s really key to driving the mission and goals of the organization. And I thought that was really interesting and awesome for WordPress, by the way. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nMm-hmm. And the internet that. Seeing that value change, I wonder if some of that got spur on with pandemic. You know, I\u2019ve heard a lot of, let\u2019s say a yo yoga studio or those in-person physical location, bricks and mortar businesses go, yeah, what do we do now? Well, I loved if there\u2019s positives that came outta covid. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIt was the fact that it pushed people to go. That\u2019s not our only means of business. But can you talk a little bit and share what you see from client perspective about the role of websites in these organizations?\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Absolutely. Absolutely. I think I have two, um, two very specific examples. I think, uh, [00:06:00] from very different sides of the coin, um, that kind of point out some of the changes that we\u2019re seeing. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, working on a project with a client who, uh, is trying to consolidate, um, a few different brands, uh, under an umbrella into one, um, during the meetings throughout this project. We can hear the different. Stakeholders in the project, throughout the company, um, really communicating what\u2019s important to them. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd this kind of goes back to what each person in the web, in the business thinks the website should do. Right. Um, you know, the CEO is is much more concerned about. The, the layout, how things are presented. Uh, you have marketing and other, um, sub-departments of, of that worried about, well, it\u2019s, is it flashy enough? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou know, where\u2019s the, where\u2019s the pizazz? And then you have, um, someone else who. Has submitted copy and then it gets pulled a week later because no one [00:07:00] within the confines of the project had really taken the time to dig deep into what those words were. So that actually became kind of an afterthought, but then it bumped up in priority. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo you have all of these different things that should matter. But there\u2019s no, uh, kind of cohesive brain on, uh mm-hmm. When and where they matter, right. Uh, because this kind of traditional business roles, right? So I think even, even business itself is kind of catching up to how it feels about what its website is and what it does. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, alternatively, um, outside of the web presence, businesses that traditionally take place, With more, uh, one-on-one, um, interactions. I have, um, a, a dear friend who I spoke with a couple weeks ago who works in oil field sales and they typically do their, their sales and marketing person to person, right? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIt\u2019s, let\u2019s, let\u2019s go on a fishing charter, let\u2019s go have lunch and all these things. And I. They are, they\u2019re not leveraging their website well enough to actually say, Hey, we now do these four [00:08:00] other things, uh, that we haven\u2019t, you know, we only tell people in, in person to person meetings, uh, and the CEO says, you know, oh, well, yeah, we have one. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd that\u2019s fine enough. But is is person to person, um, enough nowadays, are they gonna go to lunch with you and then go check out your website? Right? Do you offer a brochure of services, um, within that and explain what it is that you do? So, um, I think it\u2019s, it\u2019s such a widely used normal tool now to just go to someone\u2019s url, um, that from, from online focused. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nPrimary businesses and person to person, um, based, you know, formally traditional, right? Brick and mortar or service, service style companies, even in large industries, you know, million dollar year industries like oilfield. Um, it\u2019s, it\u2019s changing. It has to. It\u2019s, it\u2019s, yeah. I think I lost the thread there a little, but\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: No. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd why not? Why not [00:09:00] utilize this amazing technology, for instance? So, you know, you can use WordPress to build a website, but then the advent of Google and the search engines that push traffic, people are looking for destinations to find problem, you know, answers to their. Challenges. And so the advent of marketing and understanding with SEO and paid traffic and things like that, back to a site where you could convert it, measure it. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Yeah. Even, yeah, even on the back end. And that was one of the things that I talked about, uh, with my friend. They don\u2019t have a A A CRM of, of much of any kind. It just kind of lives in these guys\u2019 heads that go out to these travel routes. You know, we always live on this hit by a bus scenario mm-hmm. Of what happens if I get hit by a bus tomorrow? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWhat is my team, you know, gonna do what have, what have I laid for information and documentation and. You know, formally, uh, businesses that have been person to person are, are missing an opportunity to kind of move into that digital age of, of finding [00:10:00] clients and putting them on a journey or, um, even, even if it\u2019s just a, a consideration of the journey you wanna put people on outside of the web experience. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nRight? It\u2019s all, it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a good. Um, what am I thinking of? Mind mapping? Mm-hmm. Um, I guess of, of how you want all that to work. So from, from the backend, from the actual interfacing with the customer to the front end to how the customer sees you. There\u2019s a lot of that in between, but it\u2019s, it\u2019s now all being laid on the, on the website. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThis is the website\u2019s job and that\u2019s, there\u2019s, that\u2019s a lot. There\u2019s a lot going on.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Well, you mentioned two, two kind of groups. It\u2019s either marketing managers that I assume could have different title, but somebody that manages the marketing, seeing the value of websites for marketing their business. Uh, and then you also mentioned CEOs. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo that to me just instantly says, Importance, like recognizing the importance that a website can do all these functions. Add [00:11:00] to not just supplement, supplement, but be very complimentary and strengthen cells. You know, if you\u2019re in B2B cells, I have a friend, I think we, you and I have talked about as a manufacturing company, sells all over the world. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWell, the search results for those are probably very small, but they\u2019re long tail and very easily capturable. You know, like, yep. Um, they\u2019re, somebody\u2019s going online to find that part or that. Particular, you spell those compressors, but you know, and then so like you could grow your bottom line or your top line really easily, just with some simple things with a WordPress website. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAbsolutely. And then like you said, for those b2b, it\u2019s, there\u2019s so many things. Support is another bucket of things. I think of a website is like, I can\u2019t remember who I\u2019m supposed to call for this. Or I need to ask a question, go to the website right there. Mm-hmm.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Absolutely.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: So I think that\u2019s good. Very good. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIn terms of the industry, in terms of the [00:12:00] internet, of course, we love the open web post status and you did too of la um, through WordPress. So that\u2019s, that\u2019s good seeing that value, knowing it has such utility for the overall growth and seeing the mm-hmm. Importance of that. And then, um, but this is interesting. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo are you seeing, uh, from the role perspective, they\u2019ve now seen it. Now you have a different people coming in with different. Needs and wants for their website. And is there someone unifying that from the client perspective or is it a lot of different stakeholders coming, going, well, we need this. Okay. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIs there somebody synthesizing all of that?\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: We play that role where we can, uh, where, where we have been allowed to. I think we st oftentimes we\u2019ll get very lucky and we\u2019ll have a C-level, um, stakeholder involved that can do, uh, the, I think of as like a Venn diagram where you have linear thinkers and strategic [00:13:00] thinkers. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd that overlapping section is someone who can live in both worlds or at least empathize very well, uh, with one or the other. So, Um, we play that role as often as we can, uh, and we try to move people into a space where they realize that is possible. Uh, two things can be true. Uh, you can want to have a very grand strategic, um, uh, presence, you know, with, with wonderful colors and layout and good copy, but at the same time, There\u2019s some technical decisions that need to be made. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, you know, and some research that needs to be done kind of in between. So overlapping, uh, you\u2019ll see, um, there are specific roles. Marketing managers I find are kind of expanding into that. Um, and they\u2019re sourcing companies like us to handle the technical depth, um, and to help us translate that, that gray area, um, where you have strategy. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKind of overlapping with this linear direction of where people wanna go. [00:14:00]\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: So oftentimes it\u2019s the CEO marketing manager type that is your point person. But then are there other teams or are they funneling through that person, or are they coming straight to valet, for instance, on those?\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Oh, they\u2019ll come straight to us. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThey\u2019ll come straight to us. We work with a lot of different people within, uh, within the. The org chart. Um, but really the kind of, you have to be in a position. Where you are looking at the forest and the trees. Mm-hmm. Um, to be able to kind of drive direction or, um, get the most value out of the advice in the consultation, you know, that, that an agency like our can offer. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nBecause we can\u2019t come across too, um, too bossy, right? You\u2019re using the wrong thing. Why would you tell me that? I researched and it\u2019s fine. No, I\u2019m not saying it because you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m saying because, you know, we, we have experience. We can give you a better option. So, um, you know, it\u2019s, and we can see the [00:15:00] forest, you know, we know what else is going on. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI know you really wanna use this one tool, but you have this other one over here that you\u2019re not aware of that someone else installed. Um, you know, and those won\u2019t work together. So, you know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s. We work really well with roles that kind of have essentially the same purview in their job that we have in ours as tech advisors. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Yeah. Uh, it\u2019s, it\u2019s so interesting cuz you mentioned kind of in the, first of all this, the role of the webmaster. That\u2019s, and you know, in the early days it was maybe find somebody that can cobble this stuff together. Uh, but that changing role where they see the importance and then go, but they still need someone with expertise that can advise them, should I, I can go left or right, which way should I go? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYeah. And it seems like which the role you\u2019re, you all are providing too is offer, there\u2019s a couple of paths here and maybe steer them to one particular path.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Yeah. Yeah, that\u2019s a lot of what it is, is what\u2019s the best path for you? [00:16:00] You know, it, you may be, uh, if there\u2019s these three or four very important things, which one would benefit you the most? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou know, let\u2019s go there first and then we can go back to the three or four important things. That\u2019s, there\u2019s no static list of what\u2019s best. Mm-hmm. I mean, there\u2019s a static list of, um, what\u2019s good. But what\u2019s best? I mean, that depends. What do you, what do you need? Are you interested in growth? Are you interested in converting, are you interested in education? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou know, those are all very different, very different things.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: And you said too, like depth. So there\u2019s someone here at the organization has these strategic goals, things they want to do, um, but the depth part, and that\u2019s where, you know, Online work is pretty deep. It\u2019s so nuanced. There\u2019s so much stuff going on. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nRight. In your post, you mentioned, you know, performing well in the search engine, the SEARCHs, the search engine results, um, speed. Mm-hmm. All those kind of things they probably don\u2019t think about. And the work I\u2019ve done or helped [00:17:00] with, um, Lindsey\u2019s, my wife\u2019s Lindsey that you know real well. Um, what\u2019s her marketing agency is love her. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThat\u2019s about it. They understand strategic strategy, that what they need to do and what they need to get accomplished, but don\u2019t always have that level of depth in-house. Mm-hmm. And we were talking before we got started on the recording here, about kind of the changing roles of like, the importance of having vendors out here. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nMm-hmm. That. You know, to hire someone with this type of expertise is probably gonna be pretty hard. Uh, at almost any level. There\u2019s obviously enterprise, you know, companies that have whole teams that do web stuff. But still probably, I think, and I\u2019ve seen from our membership at Post Status still outsource a lot of the depth we\u2019re talking about because yes, it\u2019s hard to hire a WordPress professional that knows all these things and run this gamut. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nMm-hmm. And we were talking specifically about this role. Um, my view is, [00:18:00] When I was helping a client a couple years ago, uh, they\u2019d often referred to me, I was doing consulting with him as a vendor, and I\u2019d go, but. But I feel more, I care about the mission and goals of what you\u2019re trying to get accomplished. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nMm-hmm. And I don\u2019t think of myself as just someone that comes in, slots in, doesn\u2019t work, comes back out leaves. Yep. Uh, I might have multiple clients and stuff, and I think that has to shift a little bit because of the nature of the work that we\u2019re doing, that you can\u2019t maybe just hire a professional that has all that. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI need 10 of those with all the verticals you could think. Right. And so we\u2019re kind of talking about that shift and that\u2019s where that see Vale, you\u2019re truly not a vendor, you\u2019re partner mm-hmm. In what you\u2019re doing with them. Like you\u2019re saying, stick to what you do best. We\u2019ll take this part, these parts that you don\u2019t do best and go deep in those. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd, and I\u2019m curious your thoughts about all that. You mentioned fractional, so I, I\u2019m curious what your perspective is of this shift and what you see in the market.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Oh. [00:19:00] Um, I think it\u2019s, it\u2019s similar to the, the culture shift, uh, within companies where they want everybody to have culture, but they don\u2019t necessarily hire based on culture, you know? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, I think, um, building, um, building a team, people talk about fractionals now, right? Oh, fractional cmo, fractional, CFO, and. It, it implies that something\u2019s broken. I don\u2019t know, just the language, you know, like fractional. I don\u2019t need you all the time. I just need you to solve these specific problems. But that\u2019s inherently broken in and of itself in that, um, you\u2019re not incorporating someone into the big picture. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI think of it sort of, uh, my kiddo play soccer, right? So you have these forward positions, these midfield positions, and these, these defensive positions. And not everybody plays at the same time, but they\u2019re all very important to have on the field. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t call one a fractional forward, right? I wouldn\u2019t call one a fractional defender. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThey [00:20:00] know their positions deeply and they operate with the other team members in a way that. Is holistic. It makes sense. You know, they, they work together and they do their job when the time comes. So instead of fractional, um, you know, it, it\u2019s like a world of fractionals. Now everybody\u2019s fractional. Um, but if, if we could just reposition the way that vendor relationship, that vendor ideal. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThe, the, oh, you\u2019re a contractor. No, you, you, if you hire for, for depth in a specific subject matter, then you have a defender standing on the back line. Waiting for their time to, to come in. They know their job. They know their, and you don\u2019t have to sit up there as forward worrying about will this person be able to handle, handle that role in that, in that attack that\u2019s coming on. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nRight. So it\u2019s a mindset shift, I think, for the businesses, and I think it\u2019s a struggle because. I mean, what? It\u2019s, it\u2019s either part-time work or full-time work, right? All of our employment and labor laws are, are based around [00:21:00] 32 hours or 40 hours a week. You have to give people a certain amount of breaks after if they\u2019ve done so much work. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou know, this is how the world was built. This is how our, our knowing and understanding of working is. So, uh, I think it\u2019s, it\u2019s probably a little more high level than thinking about this idea of fractional and having someone come in and tell me what I need to do and then let me work on it. Um, you know, you, you bring someone in to give you good advice and then map out the action steps. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd if you\u2019re capable and you have a team member to do that, then fine. But don\u2019t, don\u2019t think I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t need a full-time, um, you know, financial officer e who does, you know, I mean, unless you have a huge company, no one\u2019s sitting there flipping through spreadsheets all day long, making sure that your numbers are in the right column in the spreadsheets, right? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThey, that that financial officer often acts in other capacities. So what\u2019s the difference, right? If you have a vendor that just doesn\u2019t do that all the time for you, you pay them whatever that time is worth and valuable to you to do what [00:22:00] you need them to do effectively. And that\u2019s okay. It doesn\u2019t need to be defined as anything other than teamwork. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUh, but that\u2019s a hard concept to wrap your mind around when you\u2019re in a traditional business setting. Does that make sense?\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Oh, it does. It illuminated so much for me with that. I think it\u2019s an analogy, but, um, if, you know businesses are in a game, Organizations are in a game to do something, make money, whatever those. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou know, from your nonprofits too, is make impact too. Um, but you think about that if the game is business or like soccer. Right. I loved when you said that you st you need certain players on the field to accomplish that and I love that how you said like a defender back here might not. Be the one that everybody thinks about. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou know, the one that\u2019s gonna score the goal, but you need someone with the goal going so the ball goes over the heads and you\u2019re someone there to do this role. And I, I love that. Cause I think it really paints it very beautifully. You\u2019re trying to do that shift you talked [00:23:00] about too. You need to fill the whole team. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nMm-hmm. And you need certain players on the team to get that job done. And I love that, like valet in this instance might have four players. On the team. Mm-hmm. Um, that, that quote aren\u2019t full-time employees, obviously, but you still need those, you need a goalie back here. You need, uh, those degrees, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: right. We can still supply you with technical depth. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWe can supply you with design depth. We can supply you with content depth. You know, it, that, that\u2019s the, that\u2019s the benefit of the different players on the field, whereas you\u2019re not hiring one person to do SEO 24 hours. You know, a day, uh, or eight hours a day, 40 hours a week rather for going with the working analogy. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nBut the, the idea is you, it\u2019s, it\u2019s not any less important to have. To have that available.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Well, if you use this, I might just kind of continue to, to, to expand on this cause I love it.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Should we say football? Uh, do we have an international audience, should we say?\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: [00:24:00] I, I think soccer\u2019s pretty international so we can stay there. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSoccer, I just don\u2019t know as much about soccer, but I\u2019ll say like, If you think about there as offensive players, and I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re called in soccer, but they\u2019re the ones that need to go score the, score the goals, hit the hit the goal, hit the mission that you\u2019re trying to do. The way I think about that before this conversation was stay in your core genius. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWhat\u2019s the thing that people come to you? Because that\u2019s the word, the magic happens, right? Those are the people you probably might need to continue to retain as a full-time employee, as part of your team.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Well, that\u2019s your marketing director, right? That\u2019s your person. That\u2019s the attacker going up, scoring the goals they know. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThey\u2019re supported. The ball has been passed up to them. A beautiful cross from, you know, your tech team or your, your content writing team, whatever supports your mm-hmm. Your major goals that you got going on. And then they, they dive right in and. Kick one in the corner of the net because they know, they know the, the, the consumer base. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThey know your customers, they know your keywords. They know what your strategy should be. They know where you wanna go next, you know, and then someone else helps them implement [00:25:00] that. That\u2019s the most powerful. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s no longer a, a game of, uh, how many balls can I juggle, and how many skills can I put on my resume? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIt\u2019s. It\u2019s how, how much time have I spent on this one skill has become, um, I, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s valued as much as it should be. It\u2019s something that businesses value in vendors, which I find very interesting. But they don\u2019t necessarily value in, in immediate hires, I think some, as much as they should. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nMm-hmm. You know, vendors. How, how many times have you, have you, uh, drawn a red balloon for a company in the healthcare space like me? Right? Is that really important or should you be more concerned about. What kind of tools do I use to draw my red balloon? What color red am I using? You know, is there a specific healthcare friendly color palette that we\u2019re using or, or those sorts of things that are, that are supportive of, of the skill that I\u2019ve spent so much time working on design, and can I make a realistic balloon? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nDoesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019ve drawn 500 of them, if they look like. Anime and that\u2019s not what you want then. Mm-hmm. You know, it doesn\u2019t really help you out any. Right. Do you want a realistic [00:26:00] balloon then? Yes. I\u2019ve drawn hundreds of realistic balloons in many different colors. Or, you know, it\u2019s, I\u2019m probably going off the rails with that, but point being, it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not valued as much, uh, with vendors or, or, uh, it\u2019s not valued much with instant hires as much as it\u2019s required of vendors. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nRight. You have, you have to have this very deep and specific knowledge. Well, you hire, you hire in-house, and you want someone to have 17 skills. I\u2019ve seen so many LinkedIn, WordPress, uh, job postings in the last couple of months, especially with the flood in the market. And it\u2019s like, must have deep knowledge of c s s must be able to project, manage and communicate effectively across team members must be able to, uh, turn concepts into action plans and must know css. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nDo you know if you want anybody to know? Sorry. You know, if you want anybody to know those things deeply enough to do them effectively at well, You know, with all of the cross browser, um, things that you need to know and, and accessibility and, and all that kind of stuff, like, [00:27:00] that\u2019s a big, big ask. Yeah. Big ask for one human. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Absolutely. And that, that\u2019s just defining that role too of agency. You think about what you do at Val as you find, recruit, train, uh, hire all those, those professionals that fit that job description. But would go, I probably wouldn\u2019t be as interested doing that role at an organization, but that you find a team of those there. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou\u2019re doing all of that work that takes time, energy, all that expertise to do all that. Why not let it over here? And you think about, there\u2019s one note you mentioned in the job skills. It\u2019s like being able to communicate across team. It\u2019s like that\u2019s your role as CEO of valet is to make sure that your team here of experts. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nInward press in particular are communicating as a team back to customers. So like why would you take that extra cognitive load too, would be my thought. Stick to the things you do best, the things that, [00:28:00] what you\u2019re scoring the goals back to soccer, you\u2019re, you\u2019re the star. Those stars do that for them. What you get to do for those that are the backstop, the defenders, like you said back there. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI, I, to me I think that\u2019s way more efficient and realistic. Um, because we know, uh, Lindsay is in the process of hiring under pressure right now, and it just takes so much time to source, find, go through the vetting process, have those co, it\u2019s just extremely time intensive. And then when we\u2019re talking to the pre-roll, it\u2019s like, You know, oftentimes when you\u2019re hiring somebody, you wanna find the right fit, but you, you always end up, uh, onboarding, training, guiding those people to do the best for what you\u2019re trying to do as an agency. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd, uh, I just go, that\u2019s a lot of effort. We\u2019ve at, at our previous company, at Themes. That\u2019s what we did. We hired experts. The things that we weren\u2019t good at, couldn\u2019t be good at to, couldn\u2019t even be. Close to good at find experts with experience and [00:29:00] expertise, pull them in and like back to soccer, I go, the coach is your CEO, your marketing manager out there that needs to execute, but should spend majority of their time on those star players on their team. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd then source the rest of their team through quality people that are worrying about that all the time. To me, that just feels like no-brainer, by the way, Kimberly. But you know, I\u2019m, uh, I say I\u2019m biased, but I just look at it from a business perspective and I go, I like this trend, uh, where that typical vendor relationship should get an enhancement. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou shouldn\u2019t think about. Well, You know, they get paid from valet or whatever it is, whatever agency. They\u2019re not part of our team. But if you think about it and find an agency like Valet that really cares, wants to do a great job and play that role on their team, hey, I think we should upgrade that, that. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nMindset and approach and attitude of contractors, vendors, and say, well, are they part of our [00:30:00] team? They might be fractionally part of our team, but we don\u2019t need them a hundred percent of the time. Right. And that\u2019s where I think about what, what you all offer, and I\u2019ve told you this for years, I love what you offer because it\u2019s not just maintenance, it\u2019s not just these things that you can probably get. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nA number of agencies. It\u2019s, it\u2019s understanding that mindset, playing those roles on the field for your client. Mm-hmm. Because you all do. And I wanna talk about that. I wanna shift gears a little bit about what you do, because I think your approach is pretty awesome, authentic, I think you all created this category. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, and, but you do it to this level, high level that is, Not just, well, but if you just maintain my website and my updates and my plugin themes, all that kind of stuff, that\u2019s cool. But it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t to me go that to be that player on the field. Could you talk a little bit about the holistic service? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCause you said in the, in the beginning, end to end, it\u2019s really compelling, but what does that mean?\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Okay, well we had many iterations of this. I think we had the [00:31:00] website, health pyramid, and then we had these pillars at one point. Um, but it\u2019s, it\u2019s really the idea that, um, expanding on the, the beliefs of what different stakeholders in a business can do for the, or the website can do for them. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIt\u2019s, it\u2019s kind of the flip side of that in the tech stack where now, because there are so many different things required, And so many different niches and expertise and all of these people that follow that you can follow that say, I can tell you how to do X really well. Uh, but that\u2019s one out of a thousand things that your website does or one out of a thousand things that your, your marketing manager does really end to end is, is conceptual in, um, conversion traffic or can people use your website? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIs the tech stack healthy? Um, are you performing? You know, are there any opportunities for improvement? But it\u2019s iterative, right? Because as you, as you grow, as you change things, you need to go back and kind of reevaluate all those. It\u2019s a [00:32:00] shifting. I haven\u2019t been able to find a really good graphic for it. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd I feel like even the pyramid, when we had it, it was probably, it was good, but it wasn\u2019t the best. Um, still it wasn\u2019t the most accurate way of, of kind of, Displaying and visually how these things shift, uh, with new people, new processes, new ideas, new initiatives within a company. You know, it, there\u2019s always something that you, you can look at and there\u2019s always something to revisit. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd then when you tie in metrics, right? We started doing these data dashboards and you start tying in metrics and looking at things that you can actually measure and set goals with. Um, you know, then it becomes a whole new ballgame. Well, now you\u2019re, now you\u2019re tweaking. Now you\u2019re, you\u2019ve entered Formula One and. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou know, you\u2019re moving little tiny notches on the engine to get that extra, you know, half a second off your start time or your run time, uh, because you\u2019re, you\u2019re really in the big leagues at that point, right? So, um, but even, even in the smaller, the smaller, um, medium business sector, there\u2019s a lot of people that don\u2019t realize that [00:33:00] there\u2019s a lot of layers. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUh, good example. Um, we have a wonderful client. Who was looking at their Google page speed times. And of course, we all know it\u2019s a rabbit hole, right? I want a hundred. No, you don\u2019t want a hundred, you can\u2019t get a hundred, uh, for many reasons. But, um, you know, and even if you do, it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t, if you get a hundred, it doesn\u2019t knock up your, your search engine ratings, right? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo, you know, what are you actually going for there, right? But, um, we\u2019re looking at some page speed, low times and had to have a, a big discussion about. Image sizes on a page image weight. So how big the actual file size is. Also, you\u2019re using a page builder also you\u2019re using, um, this thing in here. Also, you\u2019re maxing out two PHP workers every week, um, with the stuff that you need on your tech stack. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo it\u2019s not the hosting that\u2019s your problem necessarily, but you could be giving your hosting an easier time. So all these things intertwine. They intermix. I had an email [00:34:00] today. You know, uh, I need to move hosting, um, but also wanna do registration and, and webinars later. Glad you mentioned that because just hosting and hosting with webinars and registration for things is, you know, those are two different considerations. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou need two different things. So, um, it\u2019s is a, a big. A big thread that runs through all of these things that you need as far as user experience, um, accessibility, usability, tech stack, speed, performance, you know, I mean, optimization, you know, there\u2019s a lot of, a lot of, a lot of things that overlap. You can\u2019t just kind of dive deep into one anymore, so you need that end to end where people, you know, you may not. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nNeed to dive into all of those things. But you need to, to understand or work with someone who understands that those are all part of the equation. When you\u2019re having a conversation, it\u2019s not hitting a hammer, I\u2019m not hitting a nail with a hammer. You know, you\u2019re mm-hmm. You\u2019re looking at, you know, an entire piece of furniture that you\u2019re trying to put together. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo if you [00:35:00] cut this one part, maybe those four things fall down. Um, or if you add something here, maybe you weaken another part of the structure. What if we put something here, we can bolster everything. You know, so having that comprehensive knowledge of that\u2019s what end-to-end, I get in, in, in my words, my many words mm-hmm. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nMeans,\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: well, we, we talked about the first is like if a web, the website, your organization\u2019s website is vitally important to your strategy and what you\u2019re trying to get done. You need someone to go to that has depth of knowledge and breadth. Of, of services that can get you to where you\u2019re going. So I think at some point you\u2019re part mechanic, part your tuner upper performance. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, but it\u2019s like when you are trying to, to do something that\u2019s integral to your business, that involves your WordPress website, that\u2019s where valet comes in and why this is compelling to me, cuz you know, one of our, uh, the businesses we have an investment in, we brought to valet because we go, she doesn\u2019t [00:36:00] need, um, development all the time. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nRight, but sometimes she needs functionality, new features, new things for the website to get done what she\u2019s trying to get done. And that was why it was so compelling that you also offer bundles. I think of development time where you know, to try to hire that out or try to do a full-time employee is gonna be, I think, near impossible. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nBut I love that cause it was co so compelling. She might need this month, three hours of development type work. Well, they have someone to go to that\u2019s trusted, trained, great communicators to do all that, to get it done. And that\u2019s why that end ends so interesting. Cause I know in the health pyramid that we talked about, uh, a while back, um, you\u2019re thinking about all, all, all the way to analytics and metrics. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nTo features and functionality too. I just need to create a new page that has these things to, to promote my new, you know, offering those types of services. That\u2019s what you all offer and I think that\u2019s [00:37:00] why Vale is really compelling in the space. I wish not to get you just more competitors here, but I wish there was more people that understood like businesses and organizations need this. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThey can\u2019t, they\u2019re not just gonna go higher, you know, develop, develop full-time developer rates right now are. Insane. They\u2019re pretty, and I\u2019m glad because our professionals are worth it, but that you\u2019re like, I, I couldn\u2019t even think 120, $150,000 a year to just get someone that knows the stuff. But from a fractional, time wise, I can get those three, that expertise in bundles just when I need it. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nMm-hmm. Um, and then someone that knows all the way from development to metrics, health analytics, performance that understands the connection of faster spot site equals. SEO equals more traffic equals potentially more conversions in that holistic way, I think is pretty, pretty and compelling. Yeah.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Being able to give advice with, um, [00:38:00] with a, with all of that depth of experience. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThere\u2019s a, there\u2019s a story, um, The guy with the hammer that goes to work on a, on a submarine. Have you heard that one? Uhuh? Uh, there\u2019s, um, they\u2019re working on a submarine and, and this guy just can\u2019t quite get, uh, the backend, the propeller work in something\u2019s going on with it. So he, he goes through his Rolodex and finds this propeller specialist. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThat, that he knows that they\u2019ve called it in the past when they\u2019ve hit really, really tough problems. Cuz he is gotta get the submarine work in, he wants to get it going. He, this is the one thing that he just can\u2019t, you know, solve for some reason. And so he calls the guy in and the guy comes in, he is got this giant toolbox and he spends about 10 minutes looking, poking around, moving some things. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd he opens up his toolbox and pulls out this teeny tiny hammer and he walks up to the propeller, moves his finger around just a little bit and taps on it twice. And he says it\u2019s fixed and the guy goes up and he, you know, kind of spins it, oh my gosh, this is great. You fixed it. We can get going. You know, this is a huge piece [00:39:00] of machinery. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThis is a huge project we\u2019re working on. This is a huge initiative. And the guy says, okay, I\u2019ll send you an invoice. So he sends him an invoice for $40,000 and the guy was like, he calls him up, he\u2019s like, man, $40,000. Are you kidding me? And he goes, oh, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll send you an itemized invoice. And it was like, you know, um, uh, $10,000, you know, for my time, and then $30,000 knowing where to tap with the hammer. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUh, you know, it\u2019s that, it\u2019s that whole idea of, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s that\u2019s valued as much, you know, as it was because there\u2019s so many specialists. Everybody\u2019s a specialist. So why would you value, um, someone with a, with a broad based knowledge of, of an industry as much as you used to?\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Yeah, well if you, if you\u2019re getting married and won a piano player for your wedding, you gotta take into account that person has been probably spending decades. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYep. Learning the piano, learning the, the music. Practicing. Practicing to understand and back to the [00:40:00] summer music, exactly where they hit.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s like a, a Reddit thread with like, all kinds of stories like that. Right? Where what do you mean you, you know, you only gonna, you wanna charge me $250? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIt\u2019s a one hour wedding, you know, well, classically trained, but okay.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Well, so far we talked about the value of the website growing in importance, and so glad to hear that what you\u2019re seeing too, what we\u2019re seeing. Um, we\u2019ve talked about that role of the classic vendor changing, um, in a good way. Finding agencies like we have at Word at, uh, post status WordPress agencies, like Valet has been doing it for. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nGosh, how, how long have you been doing this, Valerie? I, I said Val and smash it together. Kimberly,\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Valerie, it\u2019ll be my new screen name. Um, a about a little over 10 years. Yeah. It\u2019s been, it\u2019s been a long time.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: No kidding. Years. You\u2019ve seen a lot too. Yeah, so [00:41:00] finding that agency, it has the depth of experience, has the team that can execute, has that knowledge to be that back to the soccer, to be a player or multiple players on your field, so you get to focus on what you do best. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI think that\u2019s credible and, and that just, I think, for me is a perspective on our industry, particularly with WordPress. But on the internet, the. Increasing value of, um, both websites and agencies that can do that. Take that down for you. Anything else we missed that you wanna share or, or talk about?\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Yeah, we, uh, we soft launched a, a new, um, a new. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nRefresh of the site. Um, we had to readjust our plans based on this, this conversation actually that we\u2019re having just kind of this change in shift in market, being able to provide more core competencies, um, that are highly skilled. Um, [00:42:00] and then we\u2019ve kind of, we\u2019re toying around with a new version of a smaller package. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThat we\u2019re calling Valet Express. Uh, that kind of gets you a lot of the core things that you need, um, covers that, you know, the, the gives you the basics of the end-to-end. To be able to at least see and look at things. You know, if you want help with them, then you can get help with them, if not, but, um, our, our standard plans have shifted and now include an advisor, um, for the larger ones, uh, to meet at least two times a year. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo we can kind of stay up to date, keep up with, you know, funding cycles and, you know, uh, group initiatives and, you know, be able to help plan and that kind of stuff. So, um, really excited because I mean, we, we act in an advisory capacity anytime we talk to someone, you know, make an email and an ask a question anytime they want. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nBut, um, you know, being present for those, for those meetings and changes and, and discussions is something that we really wanna. Make ourselves more available for, we\u2019re always [00:43:00] available for it, but we\u2019re never like, Hey, it\u2019s time for your six month meeting. You know, we make it more important. Uh, Then it, it smooths, it smooths the process a lot, and I think that\u2019s a big part of us trying to contribute, to help shift that idea of being, uh, invested. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWe know that we love what we do, and I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re good at it is just because we like helping. We like learning. We\u2019re not invested in selling anything in particular other than just being there, you know, and doing it. Right. We\u2019re just nerds for. We\u2019re trying to get it right and, and figure it out. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nMm-hmm. So, you know, that\u2019s what makes us passionate. So, um, you know, we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve done a, a little bit of, uh, kind of adjusting. There\u2019s still more to come, but that was kind of the first. The first big push. There\u2019ll be lots of other little changes and things we\u2019re gonna grow and add in. But, uh, you know, that\u2019s, that\u2019s been exciting. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI\u2019m so happy.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: I\u2019m so excited. That\u2019s great. Well, somebody\u2019s like, Hey, I need a nerd to help how all this fits in. Um, how do they get started and talk, get started talking to you all at Vale. What\u2019s the next step?\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Oh, [00:44:00] we have a contact form on the website. We have a phone call scheduling on the website now, and you can just, hello@valet.io rhymes. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo it\u2019s easy to remember, uh, and, you know, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll talk to you, you know that any, every conversation has to be, um, started with an idea of what you wanna do, where you wanna go, and what your goals are. I mean, that\u2019s, that makes for the most effective communication. Um, so yeah, that\u2019s the best way. Just say, hey, and we\u2019ll say, Hey, what you doing? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWhat you wanna do? And we\u2019ll go from there. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: I love it. I think that last part is key. Knowing what you want to do, where you want to go, and then coming to the website advisors vale to figure out how to get there. Absolutely key. Thank you. Kimberly Lepar of valet, CEO. Um, I appreciate your time sharing what you\u2019re seeing in the market and how you all help connect in with, um, clients for this cool thing we call the Open Web and WordPress. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKimberly Lipari: Yes. Love it. It\u2019s a place to be.\nThis article was published at Post Status \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the community for WordPress professionals.\n\nby Cory Miller at April 28, 2023 12:31 AM under Yoast\n\n\nApril 27, 2023\nPost Status: Launching a WordPress Product in Public: Session 11\n\n\nFrom practicing mindfulness to the evolution of WordPress, Corey Maass and Cory Miller cover a wide variety of topics in this episode as they continue the development of their new WordPress plugin, Crop.Express. \n\nEstimated Reading Time:  48 minutes\n\nTranscript \u00e2\u0086\u0093\nIn this episode, Corey Maass and Cory Miller move from personal to professional. They offer impactful transparency, from discussing the importance of website speed, user experience, and SEO to practicing mindfulness and finding balance. They share insights on optimizing WordPress websites for performance, including hosting, caching, and image optimization tips. They also discuss the role of content in driving traffic and engagement, as well as strategies for leveraging social media to grow an online presence.\nTop Takeaways:\n\nImposter Syndrome. Imposter syndrome is very common among people who work in tech, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge it and understand that it\u2019s okay to feel this way. It\u2019s helpful to talk to others about your feelings and to remind yourself of your accomplishments and skills. It\u2019s important not to compare yourself to others and focus on your progress and growth. Seeking support from a therapist or coach can be very helpful in managing imposter syndrome.\nSlow Hustle. Take a more intentional, thoughtful, and sustainable approach to work and life. Instead of constantly hustling and working long hours, \u00e2\u0080\u009cslow hustle\u00e2\u0080\u009d focuses on balancing work and rest, taking breaks, and being intentional about your work. Finding a pace that works for you helps in avoiding burnout. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSlow hustle\u00e2\u0080\u009d can help you find more fulfillment and purpose in your work and can be beneficial for long-term success.\nPersonal Brand. Building a personal brand can help in various aspects of life. Establish your personal brand by identifying and highlighting your unique skills and strengths, being authentic and consistent, and cultivating relationships. Use social media and online platforms to share your expertise and connect with potential clients or collaborators. Continually invest in your personal and professional development, whether through learning new skills, attending conferences, or seeking mentorship or coaching. Remember the importance of maintaining a positive and professional online presence and reputation, as this can greatly impact your personal brand and career success.\n\n\n\n Mentioned in the show:\n\nCrop.Express\nCrop.Express\nApple\nWordPress\nSquareSpace\nMedium\nSubstack\nGhost\nMatt Mullenweg\u00a0\nChris Coyier\nJeff Bezos\nMark Zuckerberg\u00a0\nTim Ferriss\nMarie Forleo\u00a0\nGary Vaynerchuk\u00a0\nCasey Neistat\u00a0\nBen Thompson\u00a0\nPeter Thiel\u00a0\n\n You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:\n\nCorey Maass\nCory Miller (CEO, Post Status)\nOlivia Bisset (Intern, Post Status)\n\nThe Post Status Draft podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis.

We\u2019re kind of in rebooting. Last week we talked about, um, blew out the vision and see all the options. And then, um, got some good stuff there. And now I think next step is, um, drum roll. Taking a lane.\u00c2\u00a0 \nCorey Maass: Yes. Uh, you know, when in, when in, we are a startup, right? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nLike we, we ride razor scooters around our office. Uh, we have a kegerator in our co-working space. String lights. We have string lights, like all the cool kids. Um, we are pivoting. Pivoting is what you do. Oh, there you go.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Um, I think we talked about, uh, Silicon Valley on H B O [00:01:00] and uh, I actually had a yellow Ford Escape. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI was driving. It was my commuter car. And uh, it was funny, my team was making fun of me about it cuz uh, ATO, Avi\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Aviato. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWell, so yeah, the, I think, and I think last time we summarized a bit about how we\u2019ve arrived here, where the idea came from. Um, and so I, I have a couple of updates that I could start with. Um, the first is, I. Released, uh, an update of Crop Express, um, the, our, our legacy product, um, and or our lead gen product or what have you, um, that now has, uh, there was a, I had not successfully, correctly [00:02:00] implemented the constraints. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSize constraints. And so that is fixed. Um, and it also now has the, our updated readme that you and I put together from the last call or the call before. Um, and so to me, I want to add one more feature that we had talked about, which was basically a, a, um, power user bypass. Because I even at one point I was like, oh, I, you know, I need an, uh, a circle image cropped, let me quick use my own tool. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd I went in and it like, you know what it output was, I don\u2019t remember. 2000 or something. And I was like, wait, this isn\u2019t, this isn\u2019t what I want. Like, I want to be able to say, you know, real quick, like we talked about, use it anywhere. Like, just make it a thousand, you know? And so I\u2019m gonna add, um, a simple dropdown. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI think what I [00:03:00] wanna do is, Like, first of all, it doesn\u2019t tell you anywhere in the cropper what it, what size it\u2019s gonna output it at. Um, uh, you know, you\u2019ve potentially set that in the setting screen, but you haven\u2019t, you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re actually cropping. And so I want to add that. And then what I think I\u2019m gonna do is add it as a dropdown. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo it\u2019s like this, you know, based on your settings, this is going to export as 2000 by 2000 or a thousand by a thousand or whatever. But in the dropdown I\u2019ll have essentially like two x, three x four x, you know, 0.75 x 0.5 x. So it\u2019ll be, you know, in the dropdown it\u2019s like, this is going to export at 2000, but from the dropdown you can say 1000 and then bang, um, or something like that. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo it\u2019s just real simple. And then, um, and then if we want to, we can, you know, or total customize and put in, [00:04:00] you can put in. Whatever crazy numbers you want, but the idea of being, you know, quick and easy, you can do something slightly different or proportionately different, logically different.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Hey, gimme one second. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI forgot to do this. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Sorry. So we start over? Yeah, no, it\u2019s fine. Um, yeah, so often awesome\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: confirmation cuz like, you value the product that you built, we did together, right? Um, enough to go, I\u2019m using it, I want to keep using it. And I think that\u2019s invaluable from a product perspective. Like mm-hmm you what, what\u2019s there and want to make it, hone it for your own thing, which I think is such a great origin for any product. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Well, and the whole eat your own dog food kind of situation of like, you know, I don\u2019t want to open Photoshop and add a circle and da da. Like, this should just be easy. Yeah. Um, so, um, with [00:05:00] that, the other, the other thing I wanna do, but I is of lower importance at the moment is to redo Crop Express the website so that it, um, has all the new features and is set up the way we want it. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nBut I think that\u2019ll be a, a weekend hackathon slightly down the road since we are deemphasizing this, the website of it, implementation of it is further deemphasized. Um, so that\u2019s that. And then, um, let me actually share my screen. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nShare. You see that? All right? Yeah. Okay, so, um, so as we talked about, I had gone somewhat far down the path of, uh, building a plugin that works against, uh, [00:06:00] screenshot Express, which is the screenshot SAS service, a API that I built. Um, so you\u2019ll see reference to social images, which was just sort of the project name, um, that I started with. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, but I\u2019m, I\u2019m so, um, me and my crazy colors, oops, sorry about the dogs. Um, me and my crazy eighties colors. Um, there\u2019s screenshot express, so I\u2019m actually pretty, um, pleased with myself, uh, with the implementation that I built initially. So, um, So here\u2019s what we have so far, essentially is, um, by activating this, it, it should throw you to a welcome screen. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIt currently doesn\u2019t, um, but it has this very cool, like the colors of the app. Um, and so you can either sign up for an account or you can log in. Um, [00:07:00] so naturally I\u2019m going to just log in. Um, hopefully you can\u2019t see my passwords.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Um, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: it signs you in. Um, it shows you what active licenses you have. If you have one already, um, you hit select and then great. It\u2019s all saved. So that\u2019s the onboarding. And obviously like that\u2019s purely technical, but that\u2019s, you know, all the steps involved with connecting yourself to the screenshot express service. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, and so obviously up for much debate between the two of us, like how we wanna, what we want to call it, how much we wanna obfuscate that we\u2019re actually using screenshot express, behind the scenes, all that stuff. But at least technically there it is. Um, and then, um, I ripped [00:08:00] out some of the stuff that I had, um, but I think you can, we can sort of illustrate at least the, what we\u2019ve got in mind here. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, and this is where I, I wanted to start talking through with you. Um, A first imagined workflow, right? So that in my mind, here\u2019s how this works, right? So you\u2019re like, I write a blog post and array block editor. Um, and then presumably you\u2019d save draft or you\u2019d publish, but let\u2019s just publish for the sake of it, right? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, and then you\u2019re like, okay, now I want to promote my blog post. Um, oh, let me add a featured image, upload a file, um, testing nice pretty [00:09:00] landscape set featured image update. I don\u2019t, this might work. This might not work. But anyway, um, so it\u2019s like you\u2019ve got a published blog post and then you say to yourself, okay, now I want to create. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nImages for sharing this to on Twitter and Facebook. Um, and so what I have so far in here, I have to go start, uh, whoops. Open. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIt\u2019s always fun doing it. Live tech demo. N p m, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nno, of course this will work. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: I\u2019m trying to write some notes too when we get there. Um, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: oh. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nOkay, not you. Next. CSS js. [00:10:00] Oh, welcome. Okay. Why are you not just working? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: This is real life. Does this sound good?\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Um, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nit is real, real life social images. I am in the right place. Um, I have the stuff that I was deleting. Uh, it\u2019s not admin, its build. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI dunno. This should just work. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Um, while you\u2019re doing that, I\u2019m. I\u2019m thinking about what you\u2019d want in the end product. Mm-hmm. The basic. Mm-hmm. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: So plugin. Oh, I didn\u2019t activate the plugin. Oh no, I did. It\u2019s there. [00:11:00] Um, oh gosh. I don\u2019t know. Okay, so whatever. Um, but the idea is, um, wait, I really wanted to show this to you. I frame, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: go ahead. You, you keep looking. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Oh, that\u2019s what it was. I totally changed this. I totally changed this. Okay, so, um, so there\u2019s no currently no menu item, but, um, because what I had changed was started doing it all in React and JavaScript, but I was like, you know what, let\u2019s just do this in, in an easier way. So like that, that whole welcome screen is actually like, you\u2019re actually hitting a button in the page, reloads. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd it\u2019s not the like cool Ajay way to do it, but who cares? It works. So, um, so let\u2019s see. We do actually build, Hey there. It\u2019s, so the idea being that, you know, somewhere on this screen you\u2019re like, okay, it\u2019s. [00:12:00] Ready to go or you know, here\u2019s my blog post. There\u2019s a big button somewhere. Or I had had it up here in the menu item that was like, you know, social images. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo it\u2019s like, okay, you\u2019re ready to go now build your social images so it takes you to a screen, um, where something like this, right, like this is a dashboard. Um, so we can actually create these things. Um, Instagram card. Right. So like you\u2019ve got things that you\u2019re building and the idea being that you\u2019re choosing a channel, which is what\u2019s, so channel being Twitter, Facebook, something like that. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nObviously we will introduce custom ones, but this is what defines the size, right? So like if it\u2019s Twitter, 1300 by 900, no, 1600 by 900, if it\u2019s Instagram, 10 80 by 10 80. Um, and then we\u2019ve also got templates. And so right now I think I [00:13:00] only have, uh, like a simple. Simple one implemented. Um, but the idea is you then it takes you to an edit screen, right? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo we are on, here\u2019s my blog post. Um, and I need to, I need a name for what these are called. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re called. Um, but you\u2019ve got, um, you know, the template that you\u2019ve started with, um, and you should be able to change this as you go. It\u2019s like, oh, right, I\u2019m no, I actually want this for Facebook or whatever. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nRight? And the template is, um, again, your starting point, but you\u2019ve got the idea of being that you then got whatever\u2019s customizable is this is your preview on the right. So again, here\u2019s my blog post that was pulled in from the blog post, right? If you want the featured image as the background. Well, I didn\u2019t implement that, so that\u2019s not showing, but that\u2019s what would show, you know, in the background. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWhat I do have implemented is, um, if you wanted to show the ti the. The date of the post. [00:14:00] Yeah. Um, right. If you wanted to add a background color, let\u2019s just make it red, right? So pretend your, you know, your featured image isn\u2019t there. You can change the font. Um, you can change the size, right? So basically, like, based off of a template you would customize, um, what this looks like. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo, you know, this is obviously not an accurate representation cuz we\u2019re saying it\u2019s Instagram, but pretend it\u2019s Twitter, it\u2019s the right proportions. You\u2019ve got it customized on the right and then you, and then you\u2019d hit a button that says print essentially, you know, stamp it, create it. Whatever that looks like. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd then, um, you can go back to your dashboard and we would have the preview of it, um, as it was created. And so then here, or any, anywhere there\u2019s a button that says download, you know, if it\u2019s Twitter, then you\u2019ve got a share directly to Twitter button, upload it to [00:15:00] Buffer kind of thing. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCool. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo that\u2019s the very clunky version. But you know, again, the, the, the walkthrough that I\u2019m starting to picture is you create a, um, anything you create in here in WordPress, a post, a page, you then have a button that says, okay, use data from this to populate a template. So it\u2019s the page title, copy excerpt. Um, You know, featured image, and then you bang through a bunch of templates, you\u2019re like, oh, there\u2019s a, the simple template that has the title on the bottom and the featured image is a background. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou\u2019ve got the card template that\u2019s got the featured image above and the title below. You\u2019ve got the, um, the Post Status template that, you know, you automatically inserts your logo on the left and your featured image on the right [00:16:00] with a title down below. You\u2019ve got the whatev, what\u2019s the other one we looked at? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, Freemeus template, that\u2019s got the flip art, you know, featured image on the right and the title on the left, and lots of white space, whatever, whatever. Um, you know, and you and each one, I guess I\u2019m picturing, have you used, um, migrate DB Pro from Delicious Brains years ago? Yeah. Um, So they\u2019ve got this real, you know, if you\u2019re, um, so it\u2019s, you know, migrating data from one site to another. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo you go in and you say, start a new migration, and you plug in the credentials and you plug in your settings. And so you, at any point you can say, go do the migration, push the data, pull the data, um, or you can save this as a template so that you can, you know, go in regularly and say, pull in the data from the site, pull in the data, you know, it\u2019s a new day. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nPull in the n the fresh data. And so I\u2019m picturing that kind of flow where, [00:17:00] um, you know, if, if all you need is, um, if all you need is a Twitter image, then click, click, click and you\u2019ve got one. Um, but you know, while you\u2019re in here, if you\u2019ve got all this configured, there\u2019s a button that says Save this, you know, as a template for every post. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd so then the next time you come in here, you know, uh, create a thing from scratch or load your. You know, send it to Corey\u2019s Twitter template, bang. And it, but again, it pulls in that post data populates your template. So it\u2019s like your, your Post Status template where it\u2019s like you\u2019d set it up once with a logo on the left and your featured image on the right, you\u2019d hit save. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThis is the Post Status, um, you know, person profile template. And then every time you just come in, drag that down and it automatically throw it on the screen. You could tweak it a little if you needed to, if the title was too long or something, and then hit print and then you\u2019ve got that image. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCool.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: [00:18:00] So yeah, from a workflow standpoint, I think that\u2019s very, uh, understandable. But this is around like a broader question that leads back to that, um, like the open graph and things like that. So, you know, when you paste the link into Slack or you paste it into Facebook or whatever that is, Um, it\u2019s pulling some data back from the website,\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Correct . \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nMost of it populated by something like Yost. Okay.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: So how does Slack, Facebook, different things know which particular image? Like when you create a post and then you put that image in there, there\u2019s multiple options and dimensions with the channels and stuff. So is that stored somewhere on the backend? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nLike if we, if someone goes, okay, I want it, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, how would that [00:19:00] automatically recognize in those platforms?\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Or does it Right? Um, yeah, we\u2019d have to look into that. Like I know that I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve played with another tool before that generated an open graph image for your blog post. Um, and. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThey, I don\u2019t remember if it worked or not. I feel like it didn\u2019t work the way I wanted it to, but it, um, it hooked into Yost. So if you had Yost running, you didn\u2019t have to say, generate an image and then download an image and then upload an image into Yost. There was a way that it was like that image was saved to the media library. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd then, um, and then Yost, there was a hook somewhere, I\u2019m sure in Yost, cuz they\u2019re real good about that. That said, for the social image point at this one. Or maybe they, they, you know, maybe they updated the metadata, the Yost metadata or something like that. But, [00:20:00] um, but yeah, that\u2019s, it\u2019s like I, you know, this is this, like what I just showed is broadly the. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, how we generate images, right? But I think like one of the onboarding things, kind of like Yost walks you through site basics, right? Like we would have some sort of onboarding as part, you know, connect to, to screenshot express. But then like, what do you want to buy? What do, what do you want your defaults to be? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCreate? And it\u2019s honestly like, it would be a great, um, user onboarding because it\u2019s like, okay, we\u2019re gonna create, you know, every website full stop needs a default o OG open graph image. So let\u2019s show you our little template builder and you\u2019re gonna build your first template. You know, that\u2019s your default website homepage, open graph image. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nDone, saved. [00:21:00] And then you can also save this as the default template that\u2019ll get used for every post. But instead of pulling in the name of your website, it\u2019ll pull in the name of your post done. And so if you check a box, um, then every post you create, you know, we can have it. Whenever you somehow indicate that you\u2019ve published, you\u2019re ready, then it\u2019ll automatically create that open graph image by default. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, and or, you know, any of these things we can get. I ideally you\u2019d get to a point where, um, you know, you publish a post, you click, okay, I\u2019m ready to promote it. There\u2019s a good word. Like the next stage after creating a thing, a post, a page is to promote it, market it, whatever. You know, click a click here to generate all of the images you\u2019ve already set up or add new ones or if, you know, if you wanna do it manually every time you can. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nBut we could, we could automate a lot of that stuff so that it\u2019s, you [00:22:00] know, cuz it, yeah, once you get down the road aways, it\u2019s like the clients that I have that are publishing articles, you know, once or twice a day, presumably they, they might, they would spot check these things, these images created, but, um, but the likely the idea, ideally the, you know, they would click a button and an OG image would be created. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd also like, if they open that dashboard screen, then it\u2019s just like, download your Twitter image, download your, or click here to, to download all of them as a zip to then send to the social media manager or something like that.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: So the reason I was asking is related back to workflow too. So you go, like, you, you hit on it. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWhere I was thinking there is like, there\u2019s a, there\u2019s a site specific open graph thing that just gets populated and then each post has, uh, a nuance of [00:23:00] that kind. I mean, we\u2019re kind of thinking like a thumbnail in a sense, but like for the social images, um, and back down the workflow, I almost go like, again, not knowing the technical part of this, but I go from a workflow standpoint. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou created your blog post, you start your build thing and like you don\u2019t even select a channel. It\u2019s like here\u2019s all like here\u2019s LinkedIn, here\u2019s Twitter, here\u2019s Facebook. Yes, here\u2019s Google things. And they\u2019re already there and generated not even if you\u2019re gonna like repost on LinkedIn or. Share, but like they\u2019re already generated because maybe somebody does share your image on LinkedIn, not you. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nRight. And you want that to show up nicely. Yeah. Um, so that was just my thought is like, first I go, oh, that\u2019s cool. He is already thought through all the channels, but then I was like, workflow wise, I just want \u2019em built for me. And maybe I\u2019m editing some of those.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Yeah. We, [00:24:00] you know, I think we define some friendly default and in an onboarding or a setup, we say, you know, by default we are creating, you know, Facebook being Facebook, they didn\u2019t name it anything. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThey named it Open graph. Twitter came along second, so they have to call it a Twitter card. Um, They\u2019ll be out of business soon. So it doesn\u2019t really matter. But, um, but it\u2019s like, you know, in the onboarding, we\u2019ll say like, by default, do you want to j Auto generate Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram for each thing you create, yes or no, just toggle using a default, a sensible default. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd then you can customize that template.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: So I think about this with our Slack community because it comes in and like, it never looks the way we wanted to, and I just go, okay, [00:25:00] we can talk about the user options at some point, but I go, I would want every channel, uh, reasonable channel created because you don\u2019t know if someone\u2019s gonna put that into Slack or something else. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: True, true, true.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: For the most popular networks. So like, even if you\u2019re not using it, you think about your visitors and you go, it want, you want it to show up nice and, and look nice. Um, so that was my, that\u2019s my thinking when I saw that is like, no matter what, this comes back to open graph, like how it, we create those and then they get tagged appropriately with open graph in, in that post. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, I think would be an excellent work focus. Then we could say for the product standpoint, it generates this on, you know, automatically for all the, so that your site looks professional, right? Any, you know, any edge case that\u2019s gonna happen. You\u2019ve made in the design, you know, [00:26:00] automation almost, and then post by post, they can, they can edit this, but I like that mindset because then we can say, I was, I was looking up open graph, um, as you were talking just to kind of understand that more. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd, um, I saw some, some little sample images that came in. I thought, okay, there\u2019s some cool ideas here. Um, what we\u2019re doing. If, if we look at the bigger view and this, I\u2019m, I\u2019m really, this is tied back down to this workflow. What we\u2019re trying to accomplish is, uh, an easy way to demonstrate an image or some concept of, this is my website where I have done this thing for you. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIt\u2019s like a presentation. And, um, some of the images, I was like, oh, there\u2019s so cool design ideas. But you think about it like, we\u2019ll go way back to product mockups and like iPhone mockups. You know how they always tilt [00:27:00] \u2019em. Mm-hmm. And I think we\u2019re trying to do here, the essence of it is we have a website we do a lot of content for. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd when we present that in the social channels or wherever it is, we want people to know this is an entity, this is a brand thing. Like, it\u2019s as silly as the little iPhone mockup when it, you know, or remember those 3D book covers. It\u2019s that 3d. Same. Oh yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It\u2019s all 3D book covers you created, you know, 3D book cover of any PDF you had. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIt\u2019s like almost in that sense. This is a website called Post or whatever. And you know, let me show you this real quick, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nbut see, like this right here. See how it\u2019s got the little top shadow? Yep. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s how we do it design wise, but the intention is like these little dots are kind of a signal of this is a website, this is, you know, even, even some of the [00:28:00] updates, like I guess that\u2019s Facebook, but you\u2019re like, those are some interesting design thoughts for the templates. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nMm-hmm. But see, that kind of thinking is you just made me professional on things I hadn\u2019t even thought about. Yeah. Because you get to the other side and you see. Um, just like when we went live on Goda or YouTube, it\u2019s got the default old Post Status logo and you\u2019re like, what you really want is some semblance of branding for the website. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nMm-hmm. And the content. So like this one right here kind of speaks more to the idea of what I\u2019m talking about is like, that could be a template. Like we could\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Right. Well search for right where you are, search for open graph image template, like in, in, in the Google box at the top, like, uh, image template. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nShould get a bunch of stuff about [00:29:00] tags, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nbut nothing too compelling. But yeah, I, I love what, where you\u2019re going. Like we could.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Like this right here is, you know, there\u2019s just a frame, like the image. Mm-hmm. I was thinking of it as like, I don\u2019t know, but there\u2019s a frame to the image we create. It\u2019s kind of like displaying, this is on my website. This is Phil website, and I\u2019m presenting it to you where like, you know, this, I mean, even the Facebook thing, this is kind of ubiquitous with like, there\u2019s a name, there\u2019s a logo. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYep. There\u2019s a, there\u2019s something here. There\u2019s an image like this, this template format. It\u2019s pretty standard. People get that. Yep. But even if you did something like logo, something like to give it a fill of this is on the web or something. Yeah, well, like the browser bar kind of thing, I guess.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Well, [00:30:00] and, and, and you can, I mean, my, my intention is I. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nLike, I don\u2019t want to, I don\u2019t want to compete with Canva, and I don\u2019t want to get into that technical, I don\u2019t wanna go that deep. Um, at least for a long time. We can\u2019t of like drag and drop, but we can. But I\u2019ve made it very, very easy to create templates. Um, and, um, and the intent is to use the, um, you know, uh, who does it, WooCommerce or, um, E D D or, um, any number of the big plugins. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou can, you can copy a template out of a plugin, put it in your theme, and then it\u2019ll get incorporated into the plugin. So it\u2019s like, you know, VVA from FIUs is like, Nope, none of these templates do what I need. Um, you know, let me create my own. And so he is, he\u2019s got a little, his little robot that\u2019s, you know, pointing at. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAt a browser that has a screenshot of the [00:31:00] website built in, just like you said, um, or the little, you know, avatar of, of the author with their little byline, um, already built in. And, um, and incorporate those into, you know, every template that you, uh, that you create. And subsequently every screenshot of every or every social image that you create for anything. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: I\u2019m on this because we\u2019ve been, like, I was just telling you I was at trying to do a frame for this, but I go, that\u2019s really what we\u2019re capturing. When you create a piece of do something, you, you package it up with a frame and then like, I\u2019m just roughing this out cause I don\u2019t have like any InDesign skills, but you go, there\u2019s a frame up here that shows like, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nKind of to, to this or this one using that. And then this is just the bar [00:32:00] that says this is a package thing. Then maybe, you know, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI\u2019m only diving into this cause I really think it, this could be really simple formula to start that would mm-hmm. Really greatly enhance anything I\u2019ve done. Um, okay. So site logo. Yep. Name, you know, that kind of goes up there and then, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nand then down here. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWe know this be meta description maybe, or something like that. Or, uh, excerpt.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Excerpt. Yep. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: But like, if you think about that from the, just these elements for a second, right? Like, we packaged that up in a way that fills like this or mm-hmm. Like, don\u2019t, we\u2019re not in the Canva game. I mean, maybe you go do that or [00:33:00] maybe you just put it in the stock image. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nBut that goes here, we pull this from , pull that from . There\u2019s a link in there. You\u2019ve got some simple branding. Oops. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI\u2019m trying to find the image to copy it. Cause I. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nLike that\u2019s up here \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nand everybody gets to see my awesome. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nBut yeah, like in this, we\u2019d only have to generate something like this. Like I could think we could get this lightly styled. Very right, very lightly styled. Pull in their logo name, have the big image here, and like I think that, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI mean, gosh, that right there, Corey. Is a significant enhancement to anything most people are doing. It\u2019s not custom, like, like these we\u2019re seeing here where [00:34:00] someone, you know, has a full-time team doing this kind of stuff, but like, then we let them be creative with their own images. Hey, we\u2019re not in that game. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWe\u2019re in this game of packaging this content. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd I mean, it\u2019s like, you know, the, the Facebook one is the, this is the frame up here. That\u2019s just the image. And this is just the title tag, headline, and description. Yep. That right there would significantly professionalize what we\u2019re doing, you know? Mm-hmm. Uh, and then we\u2019d have to stylize the, uh, generic one. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Yep. And that\u2019s what I was trying to illustrate with like, so what you\u2019d saw on the right of my little demo is, you know, the, the title of the blog post featured image in the back. So that\u2019s like, that\u2019s one, that\u2019s one template. Right. And this kind of [00:35:00] thing would be another, or wrapped in a browser. Um, a fake browser would be another. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd you know, so it\u2019s, and if they\u2019re simple to create, mostly done in, um, c s s, then it\u2019s just a matter of somebody, me or you, or both of us, like essentially cranking these out. I mean, we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t want to overwhelm. The point is not to have a gajillion templates, at least not to start with, but a few sensible defaults that, like you said, give gives everybody their initial leg up. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo like right out of the box, you\u2019ve got a sensible default, something to work with. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Sorry, I can\u2019t help myself. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nBy the way, the circle logo, you can create with Crop Express. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Give your big image of background color. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: When we first started doing that, I couldn\u2019t remember how to do that. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\n[00:36:00] Yep, there you go. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI mean, even if you took the frame off. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWe probably want to play with these and see how they looked in the different social platforms, but,\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: right. Well, and that\u2019s, and that\u2019s the, the joy of this. So it\u2019s, you know, so there\u2019s, right now, like I just looked, LinkedIn uses, um, Facebook\u2019s OG image, um, Instagram you can\u2019t import. And so outta the box, we\u2019re only talking about two. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWe\u2019re talking about Facebook\u2019s OG image and Twitter card image. So whatever their specs are. Um, and again, because it\u2019s, we\u2019re screenshotting, H T M L, it\u2019s responsive. And so presumably you can use the same mo the same template. Yeah. You know, for both. And it\u2019s like, okay, well no, I, I don\u2019t want, I don\u2019t want the, the Corey template. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI want the Corey. [00:37:00] Template. It doesn\u2019t work. Our names are the same. I don\u2019t want the, the Corey template, I want the Miller template. And that one\u2019s got a black background. You know, it\u2019s black on white, so it\u2019s like your themes on the right there, it\u2019s like one is black on white, one is white on black, one is gray with, you know, little colors on it. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, and so you\u2019re like, that\u2019s what all of my images look like for every post I create. It automatically creates a, um, Facebook or an OG image and a Twitter image. Um, as soon as I hit publish or even before, if I click a button and say, generate based on what\u2019s, you know, the information that\u2019s here. Um, and then like you said, as soon as somebody shares it, drops it into Slack, um, shares it via Twitter, Facebook, whatever, like, it\u2019ll, it\u2019ll pull in those, the image you want that\u2019s been generated that is more than just your featured image. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd then, yeah, we get into this kind of stuff where it\u2019s like, [00:38:00] what are all of the d you know, these, this is where I guess the channels thing comes in, right? Like, so a channel could not only be, um, you know, technically, like Instagram is a, is a channel, but Instagram has stories which are a vertical 16 by nine to traditional Instagram, which is square. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, you know, you can, you can share horizontal, vertical, or square on Twitter, LinkedIn Carousel is gonna have their own thing. Um, you know, what\u2019s, what\u2019s the optimal, you\u2019re in Google Slides, what\u2019s the optimal Google slide? Size and shape, like, so we can. Basically that\u2019s where we once, once we have the, the way to present templates, we can go crazy creating templates for every single channel and every, every scenario. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYeah,\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: I was just [00:39:00] thinking too, the option where you don\u2019t have an image, but it creates one, an open graph type image for you. Mm-hmm. And what you want.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Um, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nwell, and this is where we, um, um, we had talked about too, like, uh, you could have a template that looks at the content of the story for anything that\u2019s in a block quote and pulls out the first block quote or pulls out every block quote and, and generates an image for each of those quotes. So now you\u2019ve got. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIf you\u2019ve got three block quotes, you\u2019ve now got three images that are all sized and stylized for Twitter. And so then you say, okay, post this one today, this one tomorrow, and this one on Thursday \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: capture. This is just me capturing this. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nLike yeah. Even if it hadn\u2019t open quote, like you don\u2019t really have an image, but you have a powerful quote in [00:40:00] here. CSS can use some brain, like whatever your default site right is. Yeah.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Then it pull. I love that. You know, some basic styling. It\u2019s pulling in your, I mean, Mo um, WordPress Customizer has a place for a logo so we can reach for it there, and otherwise we can say, specify a logo to use across all your templates. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, And it\u2019ll auto-populate. And then you can obviously drill down and, and customize each one as you, as you mess with it. Um, oras or mess with it as much as you want to. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd so, um, so backing up, up, up, I\u2019m creating a system for customizing a couple of templates to start with manually. And your, [00:41:00] let\u2019s start with featured image kind of comment here to me, which I\u2019m, I\u2019m a hundred percent on board with, is the ability to set one of those essentially as a default so that it\u2019s auto-generated so that the moment you hit publish your story has a handsome OG image. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd we\u2019ll see about hooking that into Yost or what have you. And then we can continue to take it further. Cuz it\u2019s like, yeah, let\u2019s, let\u2019s at least cover the basics base. Let\u2019s cover the bases. Me and my sports metaphors. You\u2019re that guy. Um, let\u2019s at least do the basic of generating an an OG image, um, which is for better or worse, is the couple of other plug-ins or products that I\u2019ve seen. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThat\u2019s where they start. Um, but they also end there. So it\u2019s like, great, let\u2019s take it further than that of generating a Twitter card [00:42:00] image, but then also any other image you want. The, the workflow will start to get a little clunky because you are going to have to do something with those images. Upload them to buffer or. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUpload them manually to Twitter or whatever, but at least those images exist, at least based off of, um, WordPress post data and a template. A template or templates that you\u2019ve presumably built once and then said, save you can, the next time you publish a post, you hit, generate all these images, download a zip, and then you\u2019re not, you don\u2019t have to go to Canva and you don\u2019t have to tweak, tweak, tweak or copy, you know, duplicate, duplicate, duplicate, and tweak and insert your own data and stuff. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThey\u2019re just, they\u2019re just there. Yeah.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Well, like, uh, sorry, I, I was thinking too, here, here\u2019s where I\u2019m going with this too, is [00:43:00] I would imagine if we can create a, you know, my site, let\u2019s say has 500 posts on there with no social images. Ooh. See where I\u2019m going? Yeah. Install and it gives you a base, nicely styled, professional enough thing that can go backwards. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYep. Oh, now you\u2019ve just made shit ton of work. Extremely easy and increased their professionalism. So what I was just doing was thinking about the Sitewide thing. It\u2019s like it\u2019s just a simple business card, you know? Yep. Here\u2019s the logo, here\u2019s the site, here\u2019s our tagline. Like that might be it. Yep. Just what we\u2019ve done, but we\u2019ve hundred Xed this thing that exists that, you know, you go to all these sites and you\u2019re like, God, they\u2019ve got a whole team doing this stuff. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nMm-hmm. We just hadn\u2019t gone, boom, there\u2019s\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: value, man. Oh, huge. And that\u2019s [00:44:00] like, that to me is, um, Uh, another Delicious Brain\u2019s product, the Offload s3. Um, and the free version lets you start today. The pro version among other things, lets you go, go back and essentially catch up.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: See, and that\u2019s killer. I mean, imagine all these, okay, now we\u2019ve hit our huge value prop because imagine all the WordPress website maintenance companies that go, by the way, we noticed your, your site is just not displaying too professionally. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWe\u2019re gonna install this and click it and it\u2019s done. Yep. Holy shit.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: I mean, and even, even taking that a little further, like if I\u2019m. Excuse me, I\u2019m the agency. I come in or I\u2019m the developer. I come in, I\u2019m like, you know, yeah, I\u2019m, I\u2019m building this thing for [00:45:00] you, but, um, we\u2019re updating this thing for you. But like you said, I\u2019ve noticed that, you know, a lot of these old pages don\u2019t have these images, whatever. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, I come in and I set styles. It\u2019s like, what\u2019s, what\u2019s, like you said, what\u2019s your logo? What\u2019s your, um, brand colors? What\u2019s your, you know, and so then it\u2019s um, it\u2019s all on brand too. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: It\u2019s all on brand. And then like I meant any B2B site, so when it shows up, they might go \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nlike right there. They put incredible fingertip address. Like all the addresses. I mean, this is just nothing but a business card for your website, right? I\u2019m gonna capture that for marketing. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Um, and then, and then [00:46:00] WooCommerce, right? So, so every, every product you already have on your website, it just goes back through and, and populates and you know it, like we\u2019ve said pre in a, in a previous call, um, you know, product image, bullet points. You probably don\u2019t wanna do price, but you know, if you\u2019ve got an if, if each of your products has bullet points or has reviews. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo picture of image. Title of em or title of product, sorry, picture of product, title of product, 400 reviews, five stars and an excerpt. This widget is the best widget, you know, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nwhat do you do? What do you see? If[00:47:00]\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI go to Amazon, I want share this backpack, copy link. I go over to Post Status. I can find Corey. I say, this is the backpack I\u2019m looking at. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWhat does it do? What does it do? Apparently nothing. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIt just takes something to populate. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nNothing. I feel like maybe slack\u2019s being slow or something. Oops. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nOkay. So do you wanna share your window or all? No, I don\u2019t have anything to share. I was just seeing, I, I went and grabbed a URL from Amazon and pasted it into Post Status. Um, To you to see what it would populate with, but it [00:48:00] didn\u2019t actually populate anything. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Um, you know, a basic business card for your website basically is what we\u2019re doing. And then the on top of that is, you know, something like this, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: right? Yeah, exactly. And that\u2019s what I mean by like, so part of the onboarding, which I think would be great cuz it helps people get set up is, you know, upload a logo or specify where a logo is. I mean, Yost does the same thing. Um, and, and so you, you, it\u2019ll, it\u2019ll give you the data points that it\u2019ll give us the data, give the plugin the data points that it needs to build a sensible default. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd, and so much. And then that\u2019s your starting point for, you know, every time you wanna share, share a post, you know, start here. Well, no, this one actually [00:49:00] has a, a featured image. Let\u2019s put that in. Or, you know, if it\u2019s a, uh, you know, this is your business card for your website, but then, you know, it\u2019s a woo commerce shop, so you actually want products. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo it\u2019s like, then you\u2019d say, okay, we\u2019ll copy this, this business card template, but then, you know, add, show the featured image or something \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nand doing,\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: I mean, doing that, cross the website, um, huge, like 10 times better than what you have. A hundred times better than you have just with some basic, like I\u2019m talk I, when I did the Google search with the business card, I said, simple, modern business card. That\u2019s your favicon, or you upload your own little image. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou got, that\u2019s your site title, that\u2019s your site tagline. Maybe that\u2019s edible. And then you add in your little information. I mean,\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: yeah. [00:50:00] Yeah. And, and the default, you know, is all of these sites will go and grab, you know, ideally there\u2019s an OG image, and so you are creating one in Canva and reimporting it, um, or you, um, or it\u2019s trying to grab the first image on the page. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo usually that\u2019s the featured image. It\u2019s like, like we said, you know what, what kind of started this whole conversation a month ago now between you and I is the, like, better than a featured image put, put some bullet points on it, put the title, put the, you know, um, whatever, whatever, whatever other data points you can add so that when they share it, it\u2019s not just an image. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAn abstract image. Oh, it\u2019s a widget. It\u2019s like, oh no, it\u2019s a widget that has these benefits. Buy it on this website.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: So an over graph question is, we we\u2019re talking about generating the HTML snapshot and then making it, or [00:51:00] across the site, but we do have the h html sitting there too. Mm-hmm. I don\u2019t know how Op grf does that, but, but for what looks like, it seems like it\u2019s an image, but I mean, we still have the H M L code code rendered somewhere. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYep. Okay. So this right here. Oh, I just wanted to go down there to see. Okay. There\u2019s something here. Basically the value prop is overnight flesh out in a more professional manner. Your open graph, social distributions, I mean, I\u2019d go back to something like this if I don\u2019t have a featured image, which I don\u2019t on most of my blog posts, and, um, it\u2019ll just pull a simple image that looks a little, it\u2019s a treatment. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nLike we\u2019ve been talking about the images. What are you truly trying to do is just show its image. [00:52:00] And if you set your defaults, like having, you know, you\u2019re like, whatever, you\u2019re, were yellow or were orange. So \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nwe probably don\u2019t wanna do that, but, um Right. You know, right there. Mm-hmm. You just made something a little nicer.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Yeah. Or your, you know, logo. Logo in the top right. Or, um, you know, if there isn\u2019t a featured or, you know, and so if there\u2019s a featured image, it shows up. If there isn\u2019t, you have at least got your logo. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, you know, and or the option to, um, We could even have an option that says like, if you don\u2019t have a featured image, just do a big old logo. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Yeah. Like, uh, you know, the ultimate guide to social images, you knows the headline, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\n[00:53:00] you know, there\u2019s that option and stuff like that. Anyway, I think there\u2019s a lot here. All that to say Yep. That with the premise of open, we know it is open graph, but it\u2019s probably not the marking side, but it\u2019s like, um, instantly create a more professional open graph presence for your entire site. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSomething better, like these will be images too. And so like, so in that if programmatically we could say that. It\u2019ll pull your featured image into these, you know, spots and we\u2019re saving that image that automatically puts an image back into that post, right? Mm-hmm.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Oh yeah, we could do that. So use this as featured image gen generate better image replaced featured image. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: I mean, it\u2019s kinda like the 3D book cover. Those were just generated cuz it was all digital assets. So they wanted a visual way to [00:54:00] do that in the same sample, doing that\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: software too. Remember they start, they would show a box like you\u2019d buy at Staples, but you couldn\u2019t actually walk into Staples and buy it. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAlbum covers T-shirts. Yeah. I mean there\u2019s, and, and there\u2019s good examples online. There\u2019s lots of little apps now that, um, you can build, um, Build the screenshots or take, take a screenshot and it puts it in a browser and puts it at a tilt, like you said. Um, like we\u2019d have to play with all that. But, um, put it in a browser wrapper, put it on an iPhone, have somebody smiling and holding it on their iPhone. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou know, um, yeah. All those things. Like we can, again, once, once we\u2019ve got the template builder, essentially then our imagination, as long as we can do it in H T M L, then we can create a template that does that and people can build their own too, which is what I really like. Cuz you\u2019re, [00:55:00] you\u2019re gonna have nerds like me who will look at, um, look at a couple of hours simple templates and go, oh, cool. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nLet me, let me go build my own specific to my website, my own branding, or, you know, I. Yeah, because, and then we created Marketplace and people could sell the templates and take, get a commission. We\u2019ll go crazy baby.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Yeah. I was just trying to skip this out of, okay, the, this all seems valuable to people, uh, to me, and I think it would be, should be to other people. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd then, like you said, it, well, I mean, one is creating an open graph image for each post. Um, sitewide in each post, what we have here. I didn\u2019t, you know, there\u2019s another benefit that we talked about. It\u2019s like, well, like for my site would instantly get a bunch of thumbnails or, you know, the book [00:56:00] cover type treatment. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, then you\u2019ve just told the search engines, I\u2019ve got new image content. Mm. You\u2019ve, you\u2019ve made an update to existing posts, you know? Yep. So, That\u2019s my, maybe part three or something, but, or I don\u2019t even know. But, um, I just see that value going. Oh. Cuz you can show, people are tired of seeing, you know, crap. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYou know, you\u2019re doing all this content work, but you\u2019re tired of seeing the social distribution, open graph stuff look like crap. This solves that problem with a click. Yep. So that\u2019s why I wanted to go down this of like, where, I mean, this right here, there\u2019s a pot of gold here. I mean, if you don\u2019t, if you have great content in the past, but you don\u2019t really have a lot of the strong image stuff, then use, use these two. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYep. You know, like the table of contents [00:57:00] plug in. Mm-hmm. It\u2019ll auto generate something and then, you know, you click, click that\u2019s made, it\u2019ll pull it and then you go, yeah, sa saved whatever it is. And then now you\u2019ve added an image. Image search is what we talked about last time. Image search to a blog post with a little bit of, with some automation here. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThat\u2019s really cool. Um, yeah. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWith, you know, not a, doesn\u2019t seem like a ton of work for the user side. Um, maybe there\u2019s a, you know, an option here per post, which is use the excerpt, use the first block quote, find the H two s, the list or something, you know what I mean? Mm-hmm. And then you just, cuz I was trying to think from em, image\u2019s, search for a [00:58:00] second, you go, um, that\u2019s another way to get search engine traffic and visibility for your brand. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI mean, summarize it. Look, this is, we had this conversation a couple weeks ago. Summarize your content with this kind of \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Yeah. The tldr. Yeah.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: So for the template engine, I wanted to get all this cuz it\u2019s like, well these are all the ingredients that we could potentially want. So that, you know, when you start building it, like, okay, I need to, maybe for an image you can, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nuh, you know, pull, pull H two s, you know. Mm-hmm. Pull the first block, quote and that auto populates in here. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nOkay. Thank you for going all the way down there. Now back to this. Does this give some more fleshed out detail to the [00:59:00] template workflow? The. Workflow conversation.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Yeah, I\u2019m trying to think of where to start. Um, I think that the workflow that I\u2019m working on still, still works. I think we start with posts, um, and then we can implement like the sitewide version using whatever we\u2019ve defined. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCuz it\u2019s like, to me, the post paradigm is ex the example that we will then implement everywhere. Um, so we can basically take whatever little builder I design and stick it back in the welcome. So it\u2019s like, you know, okay, connect to your, connect your account, let\u2019s create your site business card. Do you wanna then use this for all all posts? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nDo you wanna then. You know, generate, [01:00:00] generate business cards for each post retroactively. And then do you wanna get into social images? This is kind of cool cuz it\u2019s like, we\u2019re not even, in my mind it was, it was about social. Um, like I said, I\u2019d even, you know, the sort of code name for this project for me was social images. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m, I\u2019m writing a post and then I\u2019m generating an image for Twitter or Facebook, et cetera. But we\u2019re now talking about like, there\u2019s so much other value before we even get to social. Technically. I mean, it\u2019s all technically social cuz it\u2019s about if you\u2019re sharing a post, um, than it, than it pulls in the, the featured image or what the OG image. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nBut, um, that\u2019s all, it\u2019s, it\u2019s great cuz it\u2019s all, you\u2019re covering your bases of incoming traffic and then you can go do your outbound marketing. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThe shields are up and then you fire the torpedoes. Yeah.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: It seems [01:01:00] like, okay. Start with the sidewalk, like you said. And there\u2019s an option just to make that at the beginning, to make that if no social link or something is there, use this option, then you\u2019ve professionalized your site. Um, then you could do the per post \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYeah. Option.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: And then give us all your money if you want to go to do the past ones and or the Woo commerce add-on and or. A hundred other things. We haven\u2019t, you know, the, the marketing kit generator. So it automatically spits out Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, you know, one click generate, one click download, upload it to buffer, you know, buffer integration, um, or whatever, whatever you use to, [01:02:00] to schedule your social posts. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Yeah, all those are even before getting to the post, you could say like this, just generate it through everything on the site. So there is an open graph. Mm-hmm. Image. Then when you want to tweak per post product page, whatever that is, there\u2019s maybe in post tweaking options where we can say, update from generic, there\u2019s a fallback to the site wide, and then as you want, you come in here and then we could look at which ones we do. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWe do first.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Yep. But I like the idea of a sensible default. I was like, I\u2019m, I\u2019m picturing again, like one of my sites, client sites is a magazine that\u2019s been online for 12 years. So m half the half the posts, um, um, so many of the posts have images, random sizes and things like that. [01:03:00] Um, but they\u2019ve all at least got a title and an image and a publish date. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSome of that\u2019s not true, but you know, like you could say, okay, so if somebody for whatever reason, shares a post from 10 years ago, it still looks basically good. Better than it, than, than it looks now where it\u2019s just a random featured image. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: See, I mean, Okay, so in that you go, here\u2019s this one for just the site. And then when you go to post, you\u2019re like, maybe it\u2019s some treatment like this. Like if there\u2019s a featured image, don\u2019t do the generic pull in featured image. Yep. And God, I gotta believe Corey, that the premise is if you can just make your site look professional with a click, and I think that [01:04:00] this, this right here would be the way to start. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYeah. Like a default, A default image with an option to apply to. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd then, you know, if there\u2019s a featured image in that post, go ahead and create a thumb, you know, a featured image thing. God. Right. So with that, my hypothesis would be \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nstart here with, and if we can get the applied to all posts that\u2019s worth a hundred dollars, like instantly, think about how long you\u2019d have to go to update every post. But in one click you could essentially set a very nice, we\u2019d have to land the design, you know, just a really nice modern looking design, but like in one click that\u2019s not worth a hundred dollars, update your open graph. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nRight. [01:05:00] With, and even here, we\u2019ve said if, if, if a post, if post has featured image, you know, use it with X template. Mm-hmm. If you got that out, like for, for right now, my, my value pro for Post Status would be Yeah. You know? Right. Yeah. Um, then if we wanted to going forward, we could, we could look at for Post Status as a client. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nOkay. Now, ongoing, um, when V2 hits, you know, select an image right there in the post block quote,\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: uh, freeform. Yeah. I\u2019m picturing, um, a screen. It\u2019s like if we, if we can, you know, we\u2019re, we\u2019re totally blue, blue skying here. It\u2019s like, but it\u2019s, you know, generate image. I wanna generate a bunch of images. [01:06:00] A screen opens up that says, um, looks like it has a featured image. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nLooks like it has a couple of images in line, so check, check, check. So that\u2019s three. Looks like it has block quotes, you know, two block quotes. Do you want to use them? I\u2019ll you say this one and not this one, you know? And so it\u2019s like, now generate, and that\u2019s fi you know, it just spits out five, five different images and you go, oh yeah, I like this one and this one, you know, that they, it, it fits together well. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, you know, but I think we can, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nwith some degree of reliability, we can, we can, we can at least try to pull stuff out. Like we featured Image for sure. Title for sure. Excerpt for sure. Um, I like your idea of, of essentially looking at H two s, um, creating an outline. And so, you know, they could just say, yep, that outline works, that\u2019s accurate or it\u2019s not. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, block quotes are easy cuz they\u2019re surrounded by, if they\u2019re done right, they\u2019re H T M L, you know, [01:07:00] it\u2019s an actual block quote tag. Um, and so they can, they can basically just, you know, we say, here\u2019s your template. And then here\u2019s all the elements from the page that we\u2019ve detected, and you can add your own too, you know, now click a button to sort of put them together. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nMan, I really,\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: I really like this. I feel, I feel, when we talked about crop express, it was a thing, a utility thing. We thought we needed. We know we needed, and we think hypothesis. Everybody probably needs this mostly, and thi but that was a very tiny detail in a process, right? We just got in a workflow process. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWe just got to a whole site value prop. Um, like just, just right here, [01:08:00] right now, my question would be, do we, do you. We\u2019re doing this from a SaaS that you\u2019ve already built in the, in the back. Like it has to take the information, send it over, snapshot it, send it back, right. It\u2019s almost a blend. Like the plugin in some sense might be some of the design stuff, but it\u2019s a plugin with a SaaS component to it. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nRight. Um, I don\u2019t know if that makes it easier, harder, whatever,\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: but, right. Well, I mean my, yeah, my, the way I\u2019d set this stuff up originally was I was like, you know, there\u2019s an API over there that obviously your average person doesn\u2019t know about, but you can put any product you want in front of it. And like, I\u2019m basically just running like a water company, electric company utility. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nLike, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re running a blender or an air conditioner, I\u2019m just selling you electricity. [01:09:00] So my intention originally was, To just, I, you know, here\u2019s this thing, it generates screenshots and then build all these little apps in front of it, or you can build your own. Um, and I just charge for screen, you know, per screenshot. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\ntrying to think of, I mean, so it\u2019s like you look at, um, awesome motives. Optin Monster comes to mind. You know, they are a SaaS that technically works without the WordPress plugin, but it\u2019s really 99% designed to run with the WordPress plugin, um, for WordPress. And so you pay for a number of impressions or a number of campaigns or, I don\u2019t remember what, what it is, but it\u2019s something like that. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo I think we would definitely want to. We\u2019ll have to think about that, right? Because it\u2019s like the number of, if we [01:10:00] go with my model, it\u2019s very abstracted. Um, you know, it\u2019s per image generated, but you don\u2019t want somebody to sit there and go, oh, well, if I generate one more picture, you know, or if I tweak it and then regenerate and tweak it and regenerate, like, Ooh, did I spend it an eighth of a penny? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nLike, you don\u2019t want people worrying about that. So, um, you know, some, some general, but I, again, I, I control the, the water supply. Um, so we can do it in a way that. You know, you get, you get a thousand images or it\u2019s per post or per channels, or like, we can do something that makes a lot more sense for the end user or makes sense to the end user without being as technical as, you know, per image generated May, and maybe that is what we want. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI don\u2019t know, but we can, we can kind of do what we want. Um, the, the downside is, I don\u2019t have a lot of information yet [01:11:00] about how much it actually costs, um, per, because I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve generated images for myself in a small quantity, you know, but at scale, I don\u2019t know yet.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Well, could we, could we, and I think we should use Post Status, uh, for sure. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYeah, that\u2019s wide open. There\u2019s no worries there. And I can, I\u2019ll give you a discount Post Status can pay for that, but I go, I. I want this on Post Status. Um, right. Then we go like, look what we did, we just overnight with one click essentially, um, created here, here\u2019s what I don\u2019t know from the technical side. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo like if we said just you create in there one time the open graph image. Okay. Go back for the entire site, it comes back. This is the default. That\u2019s one image. Right? Right now I don\u2019t know what the option for like [01:12:00] just that default business card image here. That\u2019s one image. Yep. The setting could be, um, you know, apply this one image across site. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI. I mean, that\u2019s just saying programmatically in WordPress, that one image in your image library right now attaches No, the default open group across the database. Am I on track there?\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Correct. Because yeah, if we do it, um, so that the image comes back and you are hosting it, what do we care? So it, it, we have to pay for a few CPU cycles. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThat\u2019s it.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: So there\u2019s that without getting pricing or whatever, but I just go that, yeah, I would, I want that today from post tennis. I want. Okay. Yeah. [01:13:00] Then we, we could say, we could use Post Status with, I don\u2019t know, thousands of articles, but, um, okay. Take most of these, a lot of these posts probably have a featured image in it on our site. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYep. And then run that. I would pay the bill post us would pay the bill for that. Now create and just see what kind of thing we\u2019re looking sure at. You\u2019ve got a third here. I added though, is like, it\u2019s one thing to do the feature, just an open graph image, but that\u2019s not saying crop it for Twitter, Facebook. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo each post can have five different images. Right.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: And that\u2019s, and that\u2019s where it, it gets, I think it, it, it may get tricky for the end user to understand cuz also they\u2019re like, okay, I\u2019ve generated images. If I share my page, I see one of those images. But where it lives [01:14:00] somewhere in the media library. But you\u2019re also showing me these, these other thumbnails. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nOne\u2019s a square that says Instagram under it, but it\u2019s not on Instagram. Like, what, what do I do with this? You know? And so like, what, that might be a little tricky. Um, that\u2019s not what you\u2019re talking about, but that\u2019s, but to me that\u2019s, you know, that\u2019s the bigger product that we\u2019re talking about is like, I, I kind of like the phrase of like media kit generator, where it\u2019s like for each post create five different images and they, and download them as a zip. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd so you get a zip file that, um, you know, or I mean, we can have a page click here to open your media kit for this post and you see all those images and there\u2019s a download button or again, a share out button or what have you. Um, but yeah, each, each post, that\u2019s, that\u2019s the thing right? Is um, As it\u2019s exponential. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo it\u2019s per post, or it\u2019s, or it\u2019s each [01:15:00] post. And then however many you want per post. And if, and if each post you wanna have, and this is, this is probably not a retroactive thing, um, but it\u2019s like I write a post today. I want Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. I want three different versions. Say they\u2019re three block quotes. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo Facebook times three, Twitter times three, Instagram times three, you know, same, same treatment, but block quote, block quote, block quote. And so I\u2019m like, okay, because I wanna schedule this to go to tweet today, tomorrow, and the next day. Like that\u2019s a proper marketing campaign around a post, a new post. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nBut that\u2019s nine social images. Plus open graph. So that\u2019s 10 per post. And that\u2019s where it starts to get exponential, you know? Um, not a bad thing. I mean, and these aren\u2019t expensive cuz [01:16:00] we\u2019re, we\u2019re using, you know, cloud computing as you\u2019d expect. But that\u2019s where it\u2019s, it might get complicated. Like we need to think about like per channel or per variation, or maybe it just is per image generated per post, or maybe it\u2019s just per, it is per, you know, it\u2019s like okay, every, every post is, you know, uh, 10 cents and you get 10 images per post. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCuz I, I, I can\u2019t imagine that we\u2019re paying a penny per image at the end of the day. Especially if we push it all back to their media library. We\u2019re not hosting it, so it doesn\u2019t, it shouldn\u2019t cost us anything to ho you know, to ongoing disk space. At some point, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll delete old images that aren\u2019t getting used or something, but, you know, we say, But how, how you bill for 10 cents. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCuz also there\u2019s this, like, one of the things that I wanted to do when I created Screenshot Express initially, I just, I like the [01:17:00] idea, you know, as we\u2019ve talked about in, um, previous sessions, we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t need this. And so we don\u2019t need, you know, this is, this is fun for us, this is a pursuit for us, but it\u2019s not, you know, do or die. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd so it\u2019s like, I want to, I want to take every opportunity to like play with conventions. And so part of the thing that, you know, always bugs me about various services, there\u2019s is there\u2019s Ford developers, there\u2019s the pay per cycle, pay per whatever. Um, And then there\u2019s the other ones that are like, you pay a hundred dollars and you get a hundred things, and if you then need 101, we mark, we bump you up to the next payment tier. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, and that bothers me because it\u2019s like, well, I, what if I only use 80, then I just gave you money, or the price per thing went up. Um, but the inverse, especially for a lot of non-technical people or in a lot of non-business [01:18:00] thinking people is like, gulp, I don\u2019t want to pay a dollar per thing because what if somebody hacks my site and uses us out a thousand things that just cost me a thousand dollars. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, and so somewhere in the middle is this like, you know, pay for blocks or, um, you know, like there\u2019s some friendly way to Yeah. Um, have variable pricing without it, with, you know, with sanity checks or something like that. So I. And I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I\u2019m way overthinking it. The truth is, is we\u2019re gonna end up just charging $99, you know, for a thousand images per, per month. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd, and we can, we can kind of gauge that when we set it up, we\u2019re like, oh, it looks like you have a thousand blog posts, and so we\u2019re gonna put you in the thousand dollars tier or whatever, you know, whatever. It\u2019s,\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: um, so it, it, it, it occurs to me for a second just to tuck this through because [01:19:00] No, that\u2019s, you\u2019re not overthinking that. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI think you\u2019re making sure if you play this out, what that looks like and there\u2019s some decisions to be made, which are good. I think so. But like, okay. There\u2019s functionality probably, like I can go to Canva and create an open one, default open graph image. Now applying that across my site is functionality. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI don\u2019t know if it exists. Or if it does, right?\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Like you\u2019d need something like, you\u2019d need something like Yost, but you are, you\u2019re, you\u2019re plugging in one image. Yeah. Maybe technically two. I think they give you Facebook and Twitter, \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nbut that\u2019s definitely, that\u2019s the easy free onboarding for sure. Yeah. And then I, I honestly think that we, we build this, we run it against Post Status. We run it against my client\u2019s site. We look at the bills, and two things are gonna [01:20:00] happen. One, we\u2019re gonna know what our costs are, and two, we will have the experience of using it and go, oh, if, if I didn\u2019t know better, I would expect to pay for this, this way. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd just, you know, and ju it\u2019ll just be like, oh, right, it should be 20 bucks. Month, build monthly.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Now, as I, as I thought about that, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll have to go back to Yos, but I go the ability to take any image I have, whether OMG does this or not, but apply it across the site. And it\u2019s probably not one, it\u2019s three. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nLike we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s Google showing up, it\u2019s Facebook, Twitter, you know, so there\u2019s, there\u2019s four images to say or something. Now two and I, huh? \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: There really is only two cuz every, I\u2019m I, as far as I know, everybody [01:21:00] uses open graph image. Twitter\u2019s the only one that\u2019s broken away. Uh oh. Like I just Googled, you know, uh, LinkedIn open graph. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd the article that comes up says, make your website shareable on LinkedIn. And it says below are the OG tags. And it\u2019s just, Facebook\u2019s OG tags. So LinkedIn just uses, use it, not just, but LinkedIn uses the same as Facebook.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Okay. Then let me, here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. This could just, this functionality No, no. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCreate an image, but just a plug in type functionality of see this image, apply it, cross the site to blogs, to everything on my site so that it\u2019s my reference sensation of my site. If it doesn\u2019t have other, other things that feels like that could be a [01:22:00] free, free option. A hundred percent. And that\u2019s valuable to, um, just going, yeah, I went to Camba, I got all my outputs, I wanna put \u2019em in and I just wanna say, apply that to my site so that instantly everything looks better if it\u2019s generic. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nOkay. But that\u2019s like probably a free option for us. Now where I go value though, is right here of I value all of my posts. Not having the generic, but having a minimal treatment. Generat an image for that post that has, if it has a featured image, put a featured image over here. Right. Something like that. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSee, that\u2019s interesting to me. I think that\u2019s what we should play with and figure out that. Mm-hmm. Because I go, I want that today and if it costs me $500, I\u2019d do it. Hmm. If, if basic like, think about doing that [01:23:00] from cama, it\u2019s gonna take you a month. Oh yeah. Uploading, creating images, downloading and all this stuff. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nBut that\u2019s worth easily $500 for me today of any post on the site has this kind of image treatment with a click. And it\u2019s in the appropriate image graph now. Just told Google and my media library is under these pages or new images. I\u2019ve just updated my content. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nYep. Like now I\u2019m kind of thinking Corey, like that\u2019s some version of, this is actually B one that\u2019s free, but, but this could be, you know, a small, I\u2019m guessing small free plugin. Upload your image. It\u2019s applied generically through your site with some real simple, you know, business card template, but this, or use cam [01:24:00] and just put it up there. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nThis is powerful to me because I go every,\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: it\u2019s a huge time saver. That\u2019s the, yeah. Time and money, right is, yeah. Like you said, we\u2019re, we\u2019re, if you\u2019re auto generating, And especially if you\u2019re auto generating in bulk. Yeah. Okay, let\u2019s sign off. I\u2019ll go build it. Okay. I\u2019ll have it to you in 15 minutes. Just kidding. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nDo you have an auto generate button for that? Yeah, it\u2019s called chat. G p t.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Uh, yeah. Hey, that\u2019s valuable. Um, what do I need to be thinking about for that? Because I\u2019m trying to put, I have the post that it\u2019s head on, but like, okay. What would I want is to be able to go through auto generate headline, an expert excerpt. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nIf it has a featured image, put it on there [01:25:00] for each post and be at in my media library attached to my post. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI mean, that\u2019s, that\u2019s a lot of value. Am I missing something here? Like I go mm-hmm. Something with a button click. You could pretty much create new images packaged, um, in a way. And then telling Google in the net social networks, this now exists for this piece of content. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nI\u2019m having a hard time saying, why wouldn\u2019t I want that right now? Like I\u2019ve right for some money, I\u2019ve instantly updated and created new content for every post on my site. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nAnd there\u2019s. I know themes used the featured image, but we, we\u2019d wanna be careful replacing the featured image. But you go like, a lot of the themes have those, well, like the Frames blog have those little, well, you know, [01:26:00] a lot of sites don\u2019t even have that.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: The hero. Yep.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: The hero, the thumbnail, whatever that is. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWhere it\u2019s like in the category archive, you\u2019ve instantly shown a nice basic modern design treatment with your colors and for everything.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Yep. Yeah. And it, I mean, and, and we\u2019d have a button that says, um, you know, swap for featured image. Like we\u2019ve taken your featured image, we\u2019ve put some text over it, you know, if you like this, make your featured image better. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSo then it just one in, one out. We\u2019re not gonna delete your featured image cuz you could regenerate, want to regenerate the image again or something. But it would, yeah, like, so we\u2019ll give you that option. Like you probably don\u2019t want to do it by default. Um, but, so yeah, I, for now, let\u2019s, let\u2019s wrap up for today. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Okay. Yeah. Sorry, I, we went over. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: No, it\u2019s fine. [01:27:00] Um, you saw my note. I put a couple of things in Slack. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nSorry, I was in Never Neverland. I like it when you\u2019re in Never Neverland.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Yes. We should get that. Um,\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: cool. Um, but I think, yeah, I think at this point, like I\u2019m pretty close to something that does something and, and let\u2019s have that something, that Alpha version run against. I mean, let\u2019s, let\u2019s get, create a Post Status staging or something. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, but see what it, you know, Let\u2019s watch it run because there\u2019s other technical things. I wanna see, like we said, pricing. I wanna see how long it takes, you know, stuff like that. So let\u2019s, let\u2019s get into, let\u2019s, let\u2019s solve the problem for one and for 10 and for a hundred. And then, [01:28:00] you know, start to, and we\u2019ll continue to talk about the actual product and we\u2019ll just, and, you know, we\u2019re designing a really nice engine. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nLet\u2019s, we\u2019ll also talk about what the car looks like and then we can drop the engine in the car.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: So there\u2019s 6,800 posts in, in Post says blog post only. Okay.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: That would be perfect. That\u2019s a great number. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: That would be \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nokay. Okay, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll be thinking about what the card I wanted to look like, but I think it\u2019s title featured image, the standard branding.\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: Um, and yeah, and like I said, I mean, we\u2019re, we\u2019re, I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve already, I have, I couldn\u2019t show you, but I have two, you know, two very basic templates started. They are so easy to create. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nWe can, we can create 10, you know, in an hour. Just going, [01:29:00] oh, put this here, here, here. Cool. That\u2019s one. Put this here, here, here. Background image two, you know, cuz I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve, for better or worse, like, I went down the rabbit hole of abstracting a lot of this stuff out. So we can just say, I want a color, you know, I want background color, I want text color, I want, so it\u2019s just color, color, color, color. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nFont, font, font, font, on and on. So, We can, we can even sit down, like once we have one basic thing that we know is running, working, then you and I could, you know, have one of these calls where we just knock together 10 different templates. Okay?\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCory Miller: Okay. Thanks man. I lost track of time. Thanks for going\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nCorey Maass: over. No, it\u2019s fine. \u00e2\u0080\u00a8\nUm, but yeah, so stay on for a minute. Okay. Session 11. End.\nThis article was published at Post Status \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the community for WordPress professionals.\n\nby Cory Miller at April 27, 2023 09:44 PM under Yoast\n\n\nBuddyPress: BuddyPress has a new purpose\n\n\nHello! This post is the first in a series of five posts in which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll outline the new direction we plan to take regarding plugin maintenance and evolutions. After some introductory words, we\u00e2\u0080\u0098ll focus on the new BuddyPress purpose that I believe we should adopt for years to come.\nWe haven\u00e2\u0080\u0098t forgotten that, at the end of 2021, we had some conversations (here & here) about this \u00c2\u00ab difficult to answer with a few words \u00c2\u00bb question. These happened once the plugin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s active installs statistics went a bit under 200.000. Our WordPress plugin directory page\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cactive installations\u00e2\u0080\u009d value suddenly changed from \u00e2\u0080\u009c200,000+\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009c100,000+\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094though the actual number only changed from just over 200.000 to about 190.000 active installation\u2013making this decline seem pretty spectacular . It was nevertheless a great opportunity to think together about how the plugin should evolve now that 15 years have passed since its birth.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let me offer some thanks on behalf of the BuddyPress development team:\n\nThanks a lot to the women & men who are trusting the plugin to power their community WordPress sites \nThanks a million to the contributors who share some of their free time, energy or resources with us to maintain the plugin \nWarm gratitude to Automattic for providing BuddyPress\u00e2\u0080\u0099s web site, our dev\u00e2\u0080\u0099updates blog as well as our Trac environment, these tools are essential to BuddyPress & its community \nFinally huge thanks to everyone of us, members of the team; for 15 years we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working together to maintain & improve this free and open-source plugin \n\n\nYour feedback: the main points\nI believe we can organize your ideas in 5 categories:\n\nWhat should be our main purpose(s)?\nHow should the plugin be organized?\nWhat features should BuddyPress include?\nWhat improvements does the plugin UI need?\nHow can we attract and keep new contributors?\n\nAs introduced earlier into this post, let\u00e2\u0080\u0098s wrap up your feedback about the first topic and explain how they contributed to what I think should be our new main purpose.\n\nKey feedback about BuddyPress\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purpose\n\n\u00c2\u00ab Communities organized around a product \u00c2\u00bb\n\u00c2\u00ab It is the perfect choice for company intranets \u00c2\u00bb\n\u00c2\u00ab Private, secure social network just for your friends/family \u00c2\u00bb\n\u00c2\u00ab Sites for educational courses, coaching \u00c2\u00bb\n\u00a0\u00c2\u00ab It would have been the collaboration platform of choice over the pandemic had the privacy and security been there \u00c2\u00bb\n\u00c2\u00ab Needs a more specific mission and purpose: BuddyVerse \u00c2\u00bb\n\u00c2\u00ab Too Developer-focused \u00c2\u00bb\n\nAs a reminder, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our site\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tagline about BuddyPress\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purpose: \u00c2\u00ab Fun & flexible software for online communities, teams, and groups. BuddyPress helps you build any kind of community website using WordPress, with member profiles, activity streams, user groups, messaging, and more. \u00c2\u00bb\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with the last point as it contains negative implications: \u00c2\u00ab too developer-focused \u00c2\u00bb . \nYes, we have third party plugins or themes in mind at some point during our coding process: our main concern about these is potential compatibility issues. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why when we have a doubt, we put backward compatibility code into the plugin. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also true we used to primarily think about BuddyPress as a plugin you can build great things on top of it; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reflected in the \u00c2\u00ab helps you build \u00c2\u00bb part of our tagline.\nThis model is interesting as long as third-party plugin authors are very involved with contributing to BuddyPress. However, they do not share their energy & time with us as often as was common in BuddyPress\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early years.\nI believe we now need to satisfy end-users first . A reproach I often read in reviews posted about the plugin on WordPress.org is: \u00c2\u00ab BuddyPress is not including the basic features any end-user would expect so that it\u2019s needed to install other third party plugins \u00c2\u00bb. And a majority of reviewers are then regularly complaining: \u00c2\u00ab a lot of these plugins have not been updated for a while or worse are no longer maintained \u00c2\u00bb.  The problem then is that using these plugins can increase WordPress sites security threats even if BuddyPress benefits from the WP hacker1 program. Being able to run a safe community is very important: we don\u2019t settle in a neighborhood when our security is at risk.\nPrivacy is a basic need we absolutely have to satisfy . Yes, BuddyPress can be an interesting choice for company intranets, social stores, family circles or social learning platforms as soon as we can easily lock some areas of the community pages.\nAbout federating WordPress site owners updates into a BuddyVerse , it\u2019s an amazing idea I already heard of 5 years ago during the WordCamp Europe 2017. As WordPress is powering around 40% of Internet sites, I guess there\u2019s an interesting potential, but I believe we need a lot more contributors to master the ActivityPub protocol (extending the ActivityPub WordPress plugin?) or the Matrix standard and required developments to allow 2 or more WordPress instances to follow each others or more globally to achieve a distributed BuddyPress network. To avoid missing the \u00c2\u00ab we figured out being chained into social media owned by capricious billionaires was masochistic \u00c2\u00bb opportunity, maybe we can make a first step into this direction and reach something approaching improving how we deal with RSS feeds & implementing Webmentions.\nTo conclude this part of your feedbacks review, I think we need to work in directions so that you can use BuddyPress to:\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00ab Get together safely, in your own way, in WordPress \u00c2\u00bb.\nI think the \u00c2\u00ab own \u00c2\u00bb word is fundamental: compared to social media  where you lose ownership over your data, where this information is used to earn money off your content. With BuddyPress, you control every aspect of your community.\n\nThe first two concrete steps\nBuddyPress 12.0, our next major version, will introduce a huge, necessary improvement to make many other improvements possible. We are replacing our Legacy URL parser with a new BP Rewrites API (which is based on the WordPress Rewrite API). We are completely restructuring the way BuddyPress analyzes URLs to decide whether to load community content and what is being requested. The benefits for you:\n\nEvery BuddyPress URL will be customizable into your language (I heard it was important for SEO).\nBuddyPress will finally support plain permalinks.\nBP URL parsing will be more reliable & fully compliant with WordPress best practices.\n\nBecause this change is potentially a breaking one for plugins that won\u00e2\u0080\u0098t be updated, we\u00e2\u0080\u0098ll also build a BP Classic plugin, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0098ll be able to continue enjoying these slow-to-update plugins.\nSecondly, 12.0 will also include a new community visibility feature giving you the ability to use BuddyPress to power your private communities.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0098ll take more time than usual to reach this 12th milestone. We need to document the needed changes plugin authors will need to perform as well as inform our users what they should do if something goes wrong with the 12.0 upgrade process.\n12.0 final release is slated for October 30, and we welcome everyone wishing to get involved.\nHow should we organize the plugin? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the second category of your feedback, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk about it in the next post of this series.\n\nProps: many thanks to @dcavins for his review .\n\nby Mathieu Viet at April 27, 2023 08:37 PM under roadmap\n\n\nDo The Woo Community: The Future of Tax Compliance for Your WooCommerce Clients\n\n\nIn the future with tax compliance for your clients, returns, automation and headless are in the forefront.\n>> The post The Future of Tax Compliance for Your WooCommerce Clients appeared first on Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community\t.\n\nby BobWP at April 27, 2023 11:03 AM under Product Growth\n\n\nWPTavern: Kirki Plugin Up for Sale, Development Discontinued\n\n\nDavid Vongries, developer of the Kirki Customizer Framework plugin, announced he is sunsetting the product and will discontinue development and support. Vongries bought the plugin in 2020 from its original creator, Ari Stathopoulos, and grew its user base from 400K to 600K active installs. He launched Kirki PRO with additional extensions in March 2022.\n\u201cWhen I first acquired Kirki in early 2020, I had big plans for it,\u201d Vongries said. \u201cAlthough we were able to execute on step one of the 2-step plan we had for the plugin, as time went on, I lost passion for the project mainly due to the direction WordPress core has taken with Gutenberg.\n\u201cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear to me now that I was too ambitious in taking on the project.\u201d\nKirki\u2019s customizer framework enabled theme authors to add custom controls and advanced features to the customizer, including the ability to style it, and add a custom header. Although block theme adoption has been a slow process, the death knell for the Customizer rang years ago. \nIn 2020, Vongries said that exploring how Kirki could potentially extend Gutenberg was one of his goals. Stathopoulos had also discussed the possibility of moving away from the customizer to work with full-site editing and global styles, helping themes that use Kirki transition to global styles. These goals did not materialize but the potential for them is still there.\nVongries is now looking for someone to acquire the plugin but is committed to providing limited support to users in the meantime, including fixing critical bugs and compatibility issues that happen as the result of WordPress core updates.\n\u201cThe current active install count in the WordPress repository is 600,000, which presents a great opportunity to revamp the plugin and get it in front of actual users,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still great potential in Kirki, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking for someone who shares that vision to take it forward.\u201d\nVongries has put a price tag of $30K on the plugin, which includes all the assets \u2013 the website, GitHub, and PRO extensions. No further active development or updates are planned unless Kirki gets acquired by someone who wants to carry it forward.\n\nby Sarah Gooding at April 27, 2023 02:05 AM under kirki\n\n\nApril 26, 2023\nPost Status: WP Feature Notifications \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Prioritizing Performance Benefits \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 DevBlog updates\n\n\nThis Week at WordPress.org (April 24, 2023)\nTired of the overwhelm of WordPress notifications?

Core contributor Jonathan Bossenger started the project in 2019 with a proposal to build a unified notification center in WordPress that would replace the chaos caused by developers hooking into admin notices, which was not designed to be a notification system.\nIn the latest 0.2.0 update of the feature plugin, contributors have implemented a more robust JavaScript-based system for standardizing how notifications appear in the admin.\n\u201cWhat originally started as a\u00c2\u00a0UX proof of concept\u00c2\u00a0has evolved into a more sophisticated\u00c2\u00a0JS-based system for displaying notifications based on serialized data,\u201d WordPress core contributor Joe Bailey-Roberts said. \u201cAt the moment this uses static dummy data, however in a future update this will interface with the upcoming REST controllers to display persistent data.\u201d\n\nThe project is restructuring its leadership with Bossenger stepping down as the lead and Bailey-Roberts taking over the position. \nAlthough WP Feature Notifications currently exists as a feature plugin, its contributors are intent on seeing it merged into core when ready, instead of kept as a canonical plugin. They are eager to see the project\u2019s design and functionality work in concert with the planned modernization of the admin as part of Gutenberg Phase 3.\n\u201cNotification functionality is indeed fundamental, and already in constant use via the admin_notices hook, a workaround that has major issues of standardization and\u00c2\u00a0accessibility,\u201d Bailey-Roberts said. \u201cThe new\u00c2\u00a0API\u00c2\u00a0needs to be universal, and available by default, otherwise admin_notices will remain the de facto option.\u201d\nContributors plan to remove the demo content from the plugin in version 0.3.0 and make it into an MVP (minimum viable product) with a functional notification system. \n\u201cThe next (and largest) piece of the puzzle is persistent database storage of notification data,\u201d Bailey-Roberts said. \u201cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working on finalizing the proposed schema, as well as discussing other issues such as retention, translations,\u00c2\u00a0multisite\u00c2\u00a0support, and more.\u201d\nIn order to keep moving the project forward, contributors are seeking a partnership with a core committer for guidance on preparing the plugin to be a good candidate fore core, as well as additional contributors with PHP and SQL expertise. The feature plugin is available on GitHub for testing.\nA solution for notifications in WordPress is critical for improving the admin experience for every user. A standardized way of displaying notifications will make site management a more predictable and less cognitively draining task. The WP Feature Notifications project is still in the early stages but it has some momentum and it needs help. Contributors can join the team\u2019s weekly office hours on WP Slack in the\u00c2\u00a0#feature-notifications channel, and the project will also have representation at WordCamp\u00c2\u00a0Europe\u2019s\u00c2\u00a0Contributor Day.\n\nby Sarah Gooding at April 26, 2023 02:03 PM under WordPress\n\n\nWPTavern: #73 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Ryan Welcher on Using the create-block Tool to Quickly Scaffold a New Block Plugin\n\n\nTranscript\n[00:00:00] Nathan Wrigley: Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.\nJukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case how a block plugin creation can be speeded up with the create-block tool.\nIf you\u2019d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.\nIf you have a topic that you\u2019d like us to feature on the podcast I\u2019m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.\nSo on the podcast today we have Ryan Welcher. Ryan is a developer advocate sponsored by Automattic. He has been developing with WordPress since 2009. And before becoming a developer advocate, worked for agencies large and small, and as a freelancer.\nIf you\u2019ve been using WordPress for any length of time, you\u2019ll have come across the new paradigm for content creation, blocks. Every part of your website can now be created and amended as a block. Pages, posts, text, images, headers, footers, navigation, and more.\nThis has widened what\u2019s possible for those who don\u2019t want to mess around with the code of their website. You can add in blocks for almost anything. And change how it looks and behaves from within the block editor interface.\nThis is an excellent move forward, but there\u2019s still an impediment for non-technical people because creating a block of your own is difficult. If you are able to use the selection of blocks that ship with WordPress Core, or you can find a third party block which does what you need, great. But if you need something specific, you\u2019re going to have to create your own block solution. And that can be hard.\nRyan is on the podcast today to tell us about the create-block tool. And how it can make your pathway towards block creation a little easier.\nWe start off talking about Ryan\u2019s background and how he became interested in WordPress.\nWe then move on to how he thinks that the adoption of blocks is becoming more widespread given the maturing of tools and learning materials available.\nThe conversation then turns to how the create-block tool can help you scaffold your blocks. It\u2019s not a tool which is going to build the blocks for you, but it will help you set up the environment and build process, which you need to get started. Really it\u2019s all about saving you time and effort on things which don\u2019t really you get you building your blocks, but which you need to do that work.\nWe discuss what you can expect from the create-block tool, and the prior knowledge that you\u2019ll need to have once the tool has you up and running. What level of expertise do you need, and is the tool under continual development?\nWe spend a few moments talking about the live streaming which Ryan does each week in which he lived code solutions to view as block-based problems.\nIf you\u2019ve thought about creating your own blocks but have been put off by the technical barrier, this podcast is for you.\nIf you\u2019re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you\u2019ll find all the other episodes.\nAnd so without further delay, I bring you Ryan Welcher.\nI am joined on the podcast today by Ryan Welcher. Hello.\n[00:04:29] Ryan Welcher: Hello. Thank you for having me. Super excited to be here today.\n[00:04:32] Nathan Wrigley: I\u2019m really, really happy to have you on the podcast today, because I really need to learn what it is that you are going to be talking about. We\u2019re going to be talking a great deal about the Create Block Tool, how it works, what it does, how to make it come onto a local computer near you. But before we do that, I wonder Ryan, if you wouldn\u2019t mind spending just a few moments telling us a little bit about yourself, your backstory, your relationship with WordPress, who you work for, all of that\u2019s good stuff.\n[00:05:00] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, so I am a developer advocate. I\u2019m sponsored by Automattic. So I\u2019m part of the five for the future, giving back to the open source project that is WordPress. I\u2019ve been a developer since about 2004. I started doing flash development. I don\u2019t know if anyone remembers flash development, but I started doing that. In 2009 I was introduced to WordPress and I haven\u2019t looked back.\nSince then I\u2019ve worked at, I was a freelancer. I worked at small agencies, large agencies, shout out to 10up, which an amazing place to work, I love that place. Yeah, and so I\u2019ve just found my way into Dev Rel, which is a very, very fun and exciting and challenging, and way different than what I was doing two years ago. But it\u2019s been great.\n[00:05:41] Nathan Wrigley: Can I go a little bit off piste, against the flow of what the conversation will be about? Could you just tell us a little bit about the way that that job works? So you are sponsored by Automattic, is that a full-time thing?\n[00:05:52] Ryan Welcher: It is. I work on a team of Dev Rel, of developer advocates, and our job is to appear on podcasts, speak at conferences, create awareness and work on documentation and do all this sort of stuff. But, sorry, yeah, I cut you off.\n[00:06:04] Nathan Wrigley: No, no, it was really just, I\u2019m curious as to how that role is advertised. Was it something that you saw in like a WordPress space, and you applied for it? And also who is it that decides what your roster of work is? Do you have autonomy there or is there a panel of people that you have to report to and so on?\n[00:06:24] Ryan Welcher: Those are great questions. So it was a role that was advertised. I saw someone mention it, and I think the WordPress Slack, the Make Slack. I applied and went through the process there. As far as the work that we do, it\u2019s kind of a mixed bag. We do have a fair amount of autonomy. This is a newer team. There\u2019s six of us for the entire internet, so. Sorry, for 43% of the internet. So there\u2019s a lot of work to do.\nWe have a focus on improving documentation. That\u2019s kind of our number one focus at the moment. But, there\u2019s a lot of smaller projects as well. I try to maintain the Gutenberg Examples repository, which is a GitHub repository that shows examples of working with blocks and some of the various things that you can do with Gutenberg, like a custom admin page that interacts with the data stores in Gutenberg and things like that.\nSo, I was just at WordCamp Asia, which was an amazing experience. I wasn\u2019t speaking, but I was meeting with lots of developers and just kind of like schmoozing. I get to schmooze professionally now, which is a lot of fun.\n[00:07:16] Nathan Wrigley: That\u2019s amazing. I do wonder since Gutenberg dropped several years ago now. I mean, it really is, it has been going for many, many years. But there really was a fork in the road for WordPress there, and there was a little bit of tension. Some people didn\u2019t see the purpose of Gutenberg and ultimately blocks. And I do wonder if roles like yours became more important after that. Do you feel like a need to message and get the word out and educate more after Gutenberg dropped?\n[00:07:49] Ryan Welcher: I think yes. I also think that the tech industry, I mean, there\u2019s always been developer advocates. I remember I went to a flash conference years and years and years ago, and I saw someone speak there who was, what were they called at the time? A platform evangelist for Adobe and was basically doing Dev Rel stuff, like showing what you can do with flash and the new features and cool stuff. So it\u2019s been around.\nI think now people are really starting to see the benefits of it. Especially when you have a large community like WordPress. There\u2019s so many people. And having people who can help, you know, the education piece. And there\u2019s a lot of yelling into the void without people like me and our team to hear what you\u2019re saying. Like, you know, the documentation needs work. Okay, well someone needs to work on that. Now that\u2019s my job to work on that.\nSo I definitely think that there\u2019s, there\u2019s benefits to Dev Rel in any industry for sure. But I think, to an extent, when 5.0 came out, I think that sort of showed the need for someone to come in and say, hey, you know, do you need help there? Or like, have you heard about this tool? Or what\u2019s path of least resistance to move from a short code to a block? All those sort of things. So I think yes and no. I think it\u2019s just overall, having a dev team for the open source project that is WordPress is a great idea to gather feedback and help and just help. Full stop.\n[00:09:06] Nathan Wrigley: I think whether it\u2019s as a result of endeavors from people like you, or just the passage of time. I get the feeling that in the year 2023, the message is really getting through. It seems like the inertia against using blocks seems to be dissipating. I really don\u2019t seem to be exposed to too many YouTube videos or people on Twitter moaning too much about that anymore. Moaning is probably the wrong word. I should probably reclassify that, questioning it.\n[00:09:38] Ryan Welcher: No, I think it\u2019s a very accurate word.\n[00:09:40] Nathan Wrigley: So it feels as though we are at an inflection point. That there\u2019s enough time that\u2019s passed. There\u2019s enough projects out there. There\u2019s enough people that have released resources and commercial products around the block space.\nIt kind of feels like it\u2019s moment has really arrived.\n[00:09:57] Ryan Welcher: I agree, yeah\n[00:09:59] Nathan Wrigley: Maybe moving from a position now of teaching people that it exists and it\u2019s an option, into teaching people how to use it and get the most out of it?\n[00:10:07] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, I would agree with that. I think since 5.0 the block API has matured, and has stabilized. There was a couple of releases where every release, the function that you called to actually register a block in php, its name changed, and its function parameters changed.\nAnd then there was like one version, and then the next version was a slight variation but the next version was the same name as the first version, but with different parameters. So there\u2019s some confusion there. And you know, with the introduction of block.json, it\u2019s the json file that describes what your block does and what its functionality is. Having those pieces sort of stable and consistent have really helped the adoption of blocks and custom blocks.\nI think also, and this is a perfect segue into what we\u2019re talking about today, the tools like to Create Block Package that we\u2019re going to talk about introduced to best practice and showed people, how do I structure my blocks?\nSo when I was at 10up, I was at 10up when Gutenberg came out. And we spent a lot of time, the company spent a lot of time trying to figure out, trying to navigate how is this going to work for an agency? How do we build these things? What files go where and things like that.\nAnd so that\u2019s a huge amount of cognitive dissonance. When you\u2019re trying to figure out a new api. When you\u2019re trying to figure out a brand new paradigm. And then you\u2019ve got to figure out, well, where do my files go? A tool like the Create Block Package just shows you where the recommended structure is. And then that takes away a lot of the guesswork, and then everything becomes consistent at that point.\nAnd then if I\u2019m working on a project that someone else has worked on, the files at least are in the same place. And, I think the maturity of blocks and the block API has really left a lot of the people who just didn\u2019t like it kind of behind.\n[00:11:39] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so given that we don\u2019t really have any accurate statistics on who\u2019s using blocks. What proportion of the 43% of the web that\u2019s using WordPress have moved over to blocks, or perhaps are sticking with the page builder that they\u2019ve been using for the last several years and so on. Given that we don\u2019t really know that, what is the elevator pitch for blocks really? What are the small things that you can mention on a podcast in a short space of time, which really nail your colors to the master and say, okay, this is the promise of blocks? This is what blocks can deliver. This is why it\u2019s new, and why it\u2019s worth looking at.\n[00:12:14] Ryan Welcher: That\u2019s a great question. I think that blocks offer, well, first of all, there\u2019s no theme or plugin lock-in. So that\u2019s a big concern with, take the example of a freelancer that is hired to build a site and the client is non-technical, but they want to be able to manage their own content.\nSo, you reach for some of these page builder tools, and now once you\u2019ve reached for them, you\u2019re locked into them. That\u2019s not a criticism, but that is inherently one issue. So with blocks you don\u2019t have that. Your blocks are part of core and you could still suffer a bit of lock-in, if you went with a very bespoke sort of block set or like a block suite or something, but there\u2019s definitely some benefits there. You don\u2019t have a lot of the overhead or any of the overhead that come with some of the larger, page builder plugins, just because they have so many features.\nAnd so there\u2019s some load considerations there. I think it changes the way that you can look at your content. This is a bit more of a philosophical question, but, so historically when we built a site, we had a title for post content. We had the content, which was like the classic editor. And then we had post meta, and you know tags and categories. But if we wanted to store an extra piece of information with a piece of content, there was really only post meta available to us, because the template that was being shown for the front end that would represent that piece of content ,was controlling the layout.\nAnd so we had to store, let\u2019s use an example of an author byline. Say we wanted to have guest authors on a site. So we wanted to store that author name. Well, on the template side you would use get post meta, the function, to get that piece of information and, and display it in your template.\nWell, now we can do that all with blocks, because our template is the editor, and the way it looks is basically represented almost one-to-one in the block editor experience and the site editor. So you have this question of, do I need all this post meta now? Now I can just store it as a block attribute, and move it around and do what I need to do with it. So I think there\u2019s lots of good reasons to use blocks. That\u2019s a few of them maybe.\n[00:14:09] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that\u2019s great. Thank you. I guess the primary issue is that using something like a page builder, whether or not it\u2019s got bloat or whether or not you\u2019ve got the lock in and all of that, is that it\u2019s relatively straightforward. You just click some buttons essentially. Drag things onto the canvas and you\u2019re done. In Gutenberg we\u2019ve got some core blocks, and increasingly you can really start to lay things out with group blocks and cover blocks and things like that. You know, you really can start to finesse the overall design.\nBut if you want to do anything bespoke, in other words, if you want to create a block which does something that you wish to do, something new, something interesting. Then you\u2019ve got to create that block. And the barrier to doing that I feel is quite high. I wonder if you\u2019ve got any thoughts on that? Whether or not the creation of blocks is still in the domain of, how to describe it? You\u2019ve got to have a certain fairly high level of understanding of all sorts of technologies to make these blocks come into existence. Or do you?\n[00:15:12] Ryan Welcher: Well, you do and you don\u2019t. It\u2019s kind of like, it\u2019s the classic developer question, you know. It depends, is always the answer. Whenever you ask a developer something, it\u2019s always, well, it depends. But, I think yes. You do need to have a certain amount of information. But take blocks out of the equation. If you wanted to make a bespoke WordPress theme, with custom templates, you still need to have a certain level of development experience and a certain level of prowess in php, html, css and things like that.\nNow, that\u2019s not to say that the barrier to entry hasn\u2019t been raised. Because when I learned WordPress in 2009, I could just copy and paste everything I did into a theme and it worked. Now we\u2019re with blocks. We\u2019re looking at, build processes and learning some JavaScript frameworks in React, some knowledge there. So there is, there\u2019s definitely some things to learn.\nNow, there are some tools that can help. Again, this Create Block Package that will kind of get you started and get you a basic scaffold of a block, that you can just then change and add your flourishes to.\nI think in general, web development is more complicated than it ever has been. I mean, that\u2019s maybe because I\u2019ve been doing it for a long time and I\u2019m an old man who fears change a little bit, maybe. I don\u2019t know. But I think that knowing JavaScript and Matt said, you know, learn JavaScript deeply, and it\u2019s true. I think I felt that pain when I was, starting to work in Gutenberg. I\u2019m a php first developer. That\u2019s what I learned. I did a little bit of JavaScript, but not a lot. Learning these new concepts was hard. But, I think it\u2019s well worth it.\nAnd I think you can do things where you don\u2019t need to know, you don\u2019t need to be an expert in React. You don\u2019t need to be an expert in Webpack and build process. You don\u2019t need to be that level. If you choose to be that level, you can, but you can do some pretty complicated blocks, with sort of a base understanding of some of the pieces that you need to put together.\nAnd I think part of my job is to help people navigate that stuff. I\u2019m a big proponent of the Create Block Package. I\u2019ve worked on the package. I\u2019ve helped to add features that developers have asked for to make life easier. One big feature was the ability to have multiple blocks be part of the plugin that is generated when you run the package.\nSo I think there is a barrier to entry, but I think it\u2019s mitigated by, like, you don\u2019t need to be an expert in all the things. You don\u2019t even need to really understand the build process, for example. It\u2019s provided, and it\u2019s just run a command and just know that this command does this and this command does that. And really, if you don\u2019t want to look under the hood, you don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s going to work for you.\n[00:17:30] Nathan Wrigley: We\u2019ll get onto the Create Block Tool in a moment, if that\u2019s all right. But just one last question around this whole education piece and learning about blocks. It feels that there\u2019s a real concerted effort now to create learning materials. There\u2019s obviously learn.wordpress.org, and a whole bunch of other things.\nI see a lot of videos being created in amongst the community. People like Jonathan Bossenger and Anne McCarthy and so on. And I\u2019m just wondering if you, well, firstly, if you feel that that\u2019s the case, if the education piece is a lot better now than it was when you were trying to learn at 10up? In other words it\u2019s less of an uphill struggle because you\u2019ve got somewhere to turn to.\n[00:18:09] Ryan Welcher: So much less, yeah.\n[00:18:11] Nathan Wrigley: So let\u2019s do that one first. Yeah.\n[00:18:13] Ryan Welcher: Absolutely. I think, yeah, you\u2019re right. I mean, I think that when Gutenberg came out, there was no real pragmatic, like practical, how to use this information. Because it was a new thing and there was a lot being changed and people didn\u2019t have the resources.\nThey didn\u2019t have the knowledge to build the resources. Now we\u2019re four years in now, and that\u2019s obviously built up. The folks that learn.wordpress.org doing a fantastic job. Jonathan\u2019s stuff is great. I\u2019m going to shamelessly self-promote here. I stream every Thursday at ten thirty Eastern on Twitch, where we do block development live. and I put that on my YouTube channel. And I\u2019m not the only one. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s, there are people that are putting out content that is up to date and accessible and easier to figure out the things that you need to do.\nNow, there\u2019s always going to be gaps in that knowledge because the APIs are still evolving, and every time there\u2019s a new release to the plugin, the Gutenberg plugin, there\u2019s new features and things like that. But yeah, I think now compared to when 5.0 came out, I think there\u2019s a lot more really good information out there.\nI\u2019m finding that there\u2019s older information that hasn\u2019t been updated. That\u2019s one of the pitfalls of the writing a tutorial on your blog post or creating a video or doing whatever, is that it\u2019s sort of a snapshot in time of the APIs. And so it\u2019s there, but then there\u2019s, well, hey, did you know that there\u2019s this new way of doing whatever it is that you\u2019re doing that\u2019s a little bit easier, you know, faster, better, smarter, or whatever, right?\n[00:19:34] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. Going back to your shameless plug. Could you tell us a little bit more about that? So you say you go live, every Thursday, and we will get from you the URL and will post it into the show notes. Do you have an agenda for that? Do you know what you\u2019re going to do in advance? Or is it driven by who shows up and what questions they want to be answered?\n[00:19:53] Ryan Welcher: it\u2019s a bit of both. I\u2019ve been doing it now for about a year and a half. I\u2019m on Twitch, which is an interesting experience. So I live code. I usually show up with some kind of agenda. Like, for example, right now, last few weeks, every other week I do a stream on the new features that have been released in the Gutenberg plugin.\nIf you\u2019re not aware, the Gutenberg plugin is on a two week release cycle. So every two weeks we get a new version of that plugin, and then all those versions get rolled up and released into the next version of WordPress Core. I go through the release posts on make.wordpress.org, and we call out some of the more developery refocused things like, a new component is added or a new whatever. So we do that.\nThe off weeks, I usually build something. Like right now I\u2019m building a block that integrates with OpenAI to generate images. But the images that are being generated are terrifying because I keep doing like people laughing. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen OpenAI generate people\u2019s faces. It\u2019s the scariest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. Have a lot of fun doing that.\nI\u2019m actually going to be doing one and I haven\u2019t done this yet, and again, sorry for the shameless self-promotion here, but in a couple of weeks I\u2019m going to be doing a bring me your block development issues stream, where I\u2019m hoping that people will submit these problems that they\u2019re running into and I\u2019m going to try to see if I can kind of like fix \u2019em live. And we\u2019re going to stream that and see how it goes. It\u2019s going to be wildly successful or it\u2019s going to be crickets the whole time. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s usually the only two extremes you get on live.\n[00:21:19] Nathan Wrigley: I do like the idea of a, like an open surgery in a way. Where people can show up and give you their problems and presumably the further in advance they can give you the problems, the more of a chance you\u2019ve got of actually solving them. But that\u2019s a really interesting idea and an excellent way to help educate people live, watching somebody else do it, not just on a forum or an email chain. Actually seeing it happen and get an explanation for why you\u2019re doing things and possibly even watching you make mistakes along the way and having to fix your own things, yeah.\n[00:21:48] Ryan Welcher: If anyone comes to my stream, you will watch me make mistakes Yeah, I can\u2019t type when people are watching. There we go, that kind of sums my stream up. But yeah, it\u2019s a lot of good fun. And we have pretty good community of people who hang out in the chat and discuss things and answer questions and help me. There\u2019s one guy, I always make fun of him because he shows up and saves the day every time if I\u2019m running into an issue, he\u2019s like, here\u2019s your code. And he just pastes it, and I\u2019m like, oh okay, great. So now we can move on because Kevin saved my stream. So shout out to Kevin.\n[00:22:14] Nathan Wrigley: That\u2019s a, lovely community feel to it though, isn\u2019t it? There\u2019s something really nice about that. But definitely, before we hang up on this call, I will get the location for that and we\u2019ll post that into the show notes. So if anybody wants to go and hang out with Ryan on a Thursday and watch him live code and possibly take your own troubles and problems and share it with Ryan, yeah, that would be a really amazing enterprise.\nOkay, let\u2019s get onto the, what we probably should have started talking about a while ago, but never mind the Create Block Tool or the Create Block Package. So one of the problems that you highlighted right at the beginning when I said, what makes blocks difficult, is you talked about the tooling and the requirements that you need just to get started. So describe the problem that the tool is solving.\n[00:22:58] Ryan Welcher: Sure. So if you want to build a block, there\u2019s a number of ways that you can do it. But if you wanted to build a block using React and JSX, which is the HTML extension, the JavaScript that React uses, you need a build process. You need the ability to take your JavaScript code and transpile, it\u2019s a fancy word of saying turn it into something else, into JavaScript that the browser can read.\nSo to do that you need a build process. And so a build process can be very complicated. Now, build processes have been around forever. If you\u2019ve heard of Grunt, or you\u2019ve heard of Bower. There\u2019s a few, so what we use is Webpack. Now Webpack can be extremely daunting to set up and deal with. The story that I always tell was the first React app I ever built was when I was working for an agency, and they wanted to use Webpack and we went to the Webpack documentation page and all it said was work in progress.\nAnd, it was very funny because the only comment on it was a giant picture of that meme of Picard with his arm stretched out going, why? I wish I had a screenshot of that because that\u2019s best story ever. Anyway, so that\u2019s your first issue.\nYour second issue is how do you even structure blocks? There\u2019s a number of files and a number of pieces to a block. And, you know, if you put 10 developers in a room, those 10 developers will have 10 different ways of scaffolding this. So that was always a bit of a problem as well. So what this tool does is it solves those problems first.\nSo it installs your build process, the one that is actually used by the Gutenberg project as well. It\u2019s maintained, it\u2019s got a million little features and you don\u2019t have to worry about that anymore. And then it also will scaffold the files for your block and put them, give you the names, give you all the files, give you a starting point.\nWhen you run the scaffolding tool, it will prefill a lot of the, sort of, details of your block and give you the starting point. And it bundles it all up inside of a plugin, and so it\u2019s a WordPress plugin that you can just enable and it installs all the dependencies and it even runs the build process. So you literally run it and then you press activate inside your plugin screen, and then you have an active block.\nThat takes away so much guesswork and so much busy work of having to like, figure out the naming of things and add files. It doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but if you\u2019re building 20 blocks, and you have to like, copy and paste all your files and go in and rename everything, that can take a lot of work.\n[00:25:10] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I can well imagine how much time that\u2019s saving. Are there any constraints about where you can install this? So, currently I\u2019m on a Mac. I presume that we\u2019re all good to go there. What about Windows, Linux?\n[00:25:22] Ryan Welcher: The only thing that you have to have is Node. So you have to have Node installed, because you can run it using a command called npx. And what it does is it, it won\u2019t download it and add it to your project, but it will just kind of reach out and run it once and then do its thing. So you need to have Node installed.\nThis does work, to the best of my knowledge, it works pretty well across all the platforms. I believe there is an issue in Windows with a very specific configuration that doesn\u2019t copy a file to the right place. But that\u2019s less about the scaffolding tool and more about the build process. But there\u2019s a lot of people that work on this stuff. So I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be remedied pretty soon, yeah. The only dependency is Node, which is cross platform.\n[00:26:02] Nathan Wrigley: Right, okay, perfect. So if I\u2019ve never done this before and I want to get my first block done. Realistically, how long is it between me thinking, hmm, create block tool, I\u2019m going to start using that, to having my first block on the page? Are we talking 10 minutes, an hour, less?\n[00:26:20] Ryan Welcher: Two minutes. Assuming you have Node installed. Let\u2019s assume that. You can go to the documentation page and you can run npx at WordPress slash create block and give it a name, and it will prompt you for a bunch of questions. Like, what do you want to call this thing? What name space should it be in? You know, what\u2019s the description?\nIt\u2019ll ask you a bunch of questions and it\u2019ll just scaffold out the block for you. And the most amount of time is waiting for the dependencies. So that the block needs to be installed and then run. And that, honestly, I did a YouTube video on my channel where I timed it. And I think it took four minutes from start to finish and it was done.\nAnd you have a fully functional plugin with a single block in it. And you enable it, and like I said, the block is available for use immediately. No, the block doesn\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s a very, very simple block. But that\u2019s how quickly you can get up and running with it.\n[00:27:09] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I think it\u2019s probably very important at this point to describe the limitations, because when I heard about Create Block Tool, I thought to myself, oh great, a tool which is going to help me to create blocks. Not literally create a block, but, you know, add in options and different, custom data and all of that. And that was what I was thinking I was going to get. So just draw a line, make it really clear what you get when this process is complete.\n[00:27:34] Ryan Welcher: You get what\u2019s referred to as a static block. So there\u2019s two types of blocks, static and dynamic. And I can get into that if you want, and with no controls. So basically the block will, it shows you a message when you insert, it says hello from the post editor. And then it\u2019ll render that same message on the front end, and there\u2019s some CSS that\u2019s supplied to the front end and the back end.\nSo it\u2019s a very, very, very basic block. The tool doesn\u2019t have the ability to say, I want to be able to insert post meta. We can\u2019t do any of that level of customization, because there\u2019s just too many options. Like there\u2019s too many ways that you can build a block, and too many things a block can do. So there\u2019s just no, there\u2019s no way for us to build a tool that says, I want to build a block that accesses the REST API to retrieve this custom post type and display all of the information and do all the stuff.\nThat\u2019s not something that the tool can do. But, what you get is a fully functioning, working block that is scaffolded to best practices, follows best practices. That shows you how to deal with the CSS, and how to enqueue all your different files, and everything is just built and ready to go for you.\nAnd then at that point you have a starting point. So, as a developer, I used to hate having to do the busy work. What this does is this basically gets me a starting point, and now I can add the things that the client is paying me to do, right? I can add the controls. I can add the interface items, whatever you\u2019re building in your block. Iit gives you the starting point to actually build the thing that you want to build, not the, you don\u2019t have to do any ramp up to get there.\n[00:29:01] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, so within two or three minutes you\u2019ll have a block. All of the files in the right place. Everything\u2019s set up. Good to go. And then, really, dear developer, it\u2019s over to you. You got to figure out where to go from there. Do you have any, is there any sort of commenting in the files that\u2019s been added additionally to give you some sort of pointers as to, okay, this is what this is doing, this file is used for this and so on?\n[00:29:24] Ryan Welcher: There is. It\u2019s commented fairly decently. There\u2019s kind of a fine line because if you want to use these for production, you know you\u2019re going to be removing a lot of those comments. There\u2019s a couple of files that every time I use it, I hate how well commented it is because I like to structure my files in a specific way. So there\u2019s a lot in there.\nAnd then, at this point too, the sort of, the structure, the file structure\u2019s very well documented and it\u2019s just been adopted. People can change things and people can, it\u2019s very flexible. You can do it whatever you want, but the best practice has been well defined at this point.\nIt\u2019s like that muscle memory thing. People just know that, oh yeah, okay. So I want to go to the edit.js file, because that\u2019s what I, that\u2019s what I changed to get it to make changes in the block editor experience and so on and so forth.\n[00:30:05] Nathan Wrigley: Do you know if, well, WordPress\u2019s mission, I suppose, is to democratize publishing. And it would be, I suppose, an endeavor worth undertaking to have a tool which did carry you on from where the Create Block Tool got you to. In other words, a tool which helped you along the process of creating the block.\nDo you know if there are any endeavors, any quiet whisperings in the dark corners of Automattic about this kind of tool? Is there any plan to do anything like that so that blocks can be created by, well, non-technical people?\n[00:30:38] Ryan Welcher: There are tools out there in the community. Like I would hesitate to say that Automattic has any sort of secret plans, because that\u2019s not really how it works. It\u2019s more, it\u2019s driven by the community. I mean, I know Automattic does employ a lot of developers who do contribute to the project.\nBut a lot of these tools come from the community and, for people like me to talk to folks and be like, hey, that\u2019d be a really cool feature to add, to Create Block. There\u2019s been a number of features where we\u2019ve been like, you know what? It\u2019s a really great idea, it\u2019s too specific. So it might be better served as a tool.\nBut I will say this, the create block package does have the ability to, you can provide what are called templates. So you can create your own custom template. So you can build a block that does X because you\u2019ve built a template. So I could build a template that is like, all right, I want to block that interfaces with custom post meta. And so I could build that template and when I run the package, I can point the package at that specific template and it will scaffold the files out, and I will have all of those starting points in there.\nIt\u2019s not an interactive tool. I don\u2019t think where you\u2019ll see, what do you want this block to do? Like, unless somebody comes up with this really cool OpenAI integration, which might be a lot actually.\n[00:31:43] Nathan Wrigley: Somebody will probably do it.\n[00:31:45] Ryan Welcher: I\u2019m sure they will. Blocks can do so many things and they\u2019re so versatile and they\u2019re so, it\u2019s sort of like, how do you even start to define the questions that you ask in the automation process to say, what do you want to do? Like, do you need to access data stores? Sure. Is it a custom data store or is it one of the ones that Gutenberg provides? You know, so there\u2019s a lot, there\u2019s a lot that goes in there.\n[00:32:06] Nathan Wrigley: Does the tool itself get regular updates? I\u2019m imagining that the technology behind that is fairly fast moving, and there\u2019s a lot of new updates.\n[00:32:15] Ryan Welcher: It is being updated regularly. The package itself gets updated every two weeks when the Gutenberg project, so when the Guttenberg plugin is in release candidate. But there are features being added all the time.\nFor example, we added the feature not too long ago to be able to copy php files around. And, there\u2019s a lot of sort of under the hood things that, I\u2019m drawing a complete blank of all the features that I\u2019ve added to this thing, but we\u2019ve added a whole bunch. Here\u2019s an example. So when you scaffold out the block, all of your JavaScript files sit inside a SRC or a source folder. And people, they may not necessarily want that because they might already have a source folder.\nThey might want to call it something like, so if you have an existing project, you might want to call it blocks instead of source. So what we did was we added the ability to be able to target that differently. So you could call it something else. And this works with the scripts package too. So you could define it a certain way and then have scripts look at that. Or one big feature that people were asking for was, we don\u2019t want to scaffold a plugin every single time.\nIf we have an existing plugin, we just want the block. So we built a no plugin mode where you could run it inside your source directory and it would just give you the block files. And now you\u2019ve got a second block inside that plugin. So those sort of things. And those all came from the community. They all came from people using the package and saying, this is stumbling block for us because we have to copy and paste and move things around.\nWhy can\u2019t we just add a command that does it? So we were able to add that stuff in and it\u2019s, I mean, I think it drives adoption, but it also. The whole point of this is to make people\u2019s lives easier. If it\u2019s more work to use the tool than it is to do it manually, then it\u2019s, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth, you know, the juice isn\u2019t worth the squeeze, so to speak.\n[00:33:47] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that\u2019s a good point. It just occurs to me that we never said where we find this tool. Do you happen to have a handy URL available?\n[00:33:54] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, you can look in the developer.wordpress.org. I\u2019m not going to read the whole url, but just do a search for create block. All the documentation is available there. It\u2019s actually hosted on npm. So, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll add it to the show notes, but the documentation is all there and it explains how to use it and all the available flags and all the available commands that you can do.\nThere\u2019s even a more advanced page on creating custom templates. I really love the custom template idea. Well, what do they call it? They call it external templates. External project templates is the official name. And what it allows you to do is like, if you\u2019re an agency and you want to build blocks in a very specific way, you can define that and then everyone in your agency is going to use that same template with this package.\nAnd you can use local packages, or you can host them on npm if you want to share them. It\u2019s very, very, very, very versatile. With that, the sky\u2019s the limit. You can literally do whatever you want.\nYou can scaffold the block to do anything, and then just target that particular sort of style of block. Like I built one that would do dynamic blocks because at the time the tool didn\u2019t support dynamic blocks, and now it does, by the way. My template is obsolete now, but that was a thing that we needed. So if you wanted to build a dynamic block, you would just target my template instead of the built-in one, and you would get that sort of flavor of block.\n[00:35:06] Nathan Wrigley: You, mentioned a little while ago, maybe 20 minutes or so ago, that there was this dynamic block, and you said you might digress into that, but we never did. So let\u2019s go down that little path just for a moment, yeah.\n[00:35:16] Ryan Welcher: Sure thing. So like I said before, there\u2019s two types of blocks. We have a static block and we have dynamic blocks. So a static block, the difference is basically where stuff is saved or if it\u2019s saved. So, in a static block. So all, I\u2019d say the majority of core blocks are static, meaning that when you hit save, it actually saves the markup into the post content.\nSo it\u2019s saved to the database. A dynamic block doesn\u2019t do that. A dynamic block uses php to render the front end, the way we would always sort of, add run until the pages loaded and that file is run, and then it displays its information. And that\u2019s basically the difference.\nNow there\u2019s some trade offs for both. With static blocks, when there\u2019s markup changes, you have to do this thing called deprecation. So you tell Gutenberg, if there\u2019s any developers listening, I\u2019m sure there are. If you\u2019ve ever seen that, like, you know, the block, we couldn\u2019t render the block. There was an error. Everyone\u2019s seen that error. That\u2019s because some markup has changed.\nYou need to deprecate that. So that\u2019s an extra step. Where with dynamic blocks, you don\u2019t need to do that because it\u2019s always run live, so to speak, right? So there\u2019s some benefits to using a dynamic block for that regard. But the trade out there is you have markup in two places. So that\u2019s, at a high level, the difference.\n[00:36:26] Nathan Wrigley: And the create block tool will point you in the right direction of creating one or the other, depending on which your.\n[00:36:33] Ryan Welcher: Yeah, it lets you choose. So there is a flag called a variant, and you can choose between static or dynamic. I believe the default is static. It\u2019ll give you a static block if you don\u2019t run that flag. But if you say variant dynamic, it\u2019ll do a dynamic one. And then there\u2019s actually, within your templates, this is getting really the weeds, but if you define a template, you can actually have multiple variants. So you could have your own variant. You could have a TypeScript variant for your particular template. Or like a, I don\u2019t know, Tailwind CSS one. So there\u2019s a lot of flexibility there is where I\u2019m going with that.\n[00:37:03] Nathan Wrigley: Amazing. So much going on in the WordPress space at the moment. On every level. From straightforward to incredibly complicated. And feel this is on the incredibly complicated side, but really interesting work. You mentioned that you are obviously into this, but there were a couple of other names which came off your tongue earlier. I\u2019m wondering if in the round, you could just drop some of those names, people that we might like to go and find, as well as yourself, who are working with you, pushing the Create Block Tool.\n[00:37:36] Ryan Welcher: There\u2019s the folks that I work with on my team. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll know all these names. Birgit Pauli Haack is on the team. She\u2019s the Brains behind Gutenberg Times and all that stuff. Justin Tadlock is on the team as well. I\u2019m sure everyone knows Justin. There is Michael Burge who is on our team, and think that\u2019s it.\n[00:37:54] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. Well if there\u2019s any that you\u2019ve missed out, you can always fire them over in my direction and we\u2019ll make sure, that they get into the show notes. If anybody has been listening to this episode and they\u2019ve thought, you know what, this is curious. This is something that I need to begin to play with, but I would like to find out a little bit more first. We know you\u2019ve got the Twitch channel, and we\u2019ll push people towards that. But what other places can people get in touch with you Ryan?\n[00:38:19] Ryan Welcher: Sure. I have a YouTube channel as well, so I\u2019m Ryan Welcher Codes in both places, Twitch and YouTube. I try to answer the comments on YouTube as often as possible, but sometimes I don\u2019t get to them right away, but I\u2019m at Ryan Welcher on Twitter and my DMs are open, so feel free.\nI\u2019m Welcher or Ryan Welcher or Welcher Ryan in a million different Slack channels. So, I think I\u2019m Welcher in Make Slack. I\u2019m on Post Status. I\u2019m on Discord in a few places. So just search my name or variations of my name and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll run into me and, I\u2019d be happy to speak with anyone one-on-one in a public forum, whatever, whatever works.\n[00:38:54] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you for making yourself available, and thank you for talking to us today about the Create Block Package stroke Tool. That\u2019s been really, really interesting. Ryan, thanks so much.\n[00:39:04] Ryan Welcher: Thanks so much for having me and I hope I can come back sometime.\n\nOn the podcast today we have Ryan Welcher.\nRyan is a developer advocate sponsored by Automattic. He has been developing with WordPress since 2009 and before becoming a developer advocate, worked for agencies large and small and as a freelancer.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been using WordPress for any length of time, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have come across the new paradigm for content creation, blocks. Every part of your website can now be created and amended as a block. Pages, posts, text, images, headers, footers, navigation and more.\nThis has widened what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible for people who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to mess around with the code of their website. You can add in blocks for almost anything, and change how it looks and behaves from within the block editor interface.\nThis is an excellent move forward, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still an impediment for non-technical people, because creating a block of your own is difficult. If you are able to use the selection of blocks that ship with WordPress Core, or you can find a third party block which does what you need, great, but if you need something specific, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to create your own block solution, and that can be hard.\nRyan is on the podcast today to tell you about the create-block tool, and how it can make your pathway towards block creation a little easier.\nWe start off talking about Ryan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s background, and how he became interested in WordPress. We then move on to how he thinks that the adoption of blocks is becoming more widespread given the maturing of the tools and learning materials available.\nThe conversation then turns to how the create-block tool can help you scaffold your blocks. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a tool which is going to build the blocks for you, but it will help you set up the environment and build process, which you need to get started. Really, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about saving you time and effort on things which don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really get you building your blocks, but which you need to do that work.\nWe discuss what you can expect from the create-block tool, and the prior knowledge that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to have once the tool has you up and running. What level of expertise do you need, and is the tool under continual development?\nWe spend a few moments talking about the livestreaming which Ryan does each week in which he live codes solutions to viewers block based problems.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve thought about creating your own blocks, but have been put off by the technical barrier, this podcast is for you.\nUseful links.\n10up\nGutenberg Examples GitHub repository\nWordCamp Asia\ncreate-block package\nlearn.wordpress.org\ncreate-block documentation on npm\nGutenberg Times\nRyan\u2019s YouTube and Twitch channels\nRyan\u2019s Twitter\n\nby Nathan Wrigley at April 26, 2023 02:00 PM under podcast\n\n\nDo The Woo Community: Do the Woo Joins WordCamp Europe 2023 as Media Partner\n\n\nWe are proud to join others as a Media Partner for this year's WordCamp Europe. See you in Athens in June. \n>> The post Do the Woo Joins WordCamp Europe 2023 as Media Partner appeared first on Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community\t.\n\nby BobWP at April 26, 2023 12:29 PM under WooBuilder Blog\n\n\nWPTavern: Ollie Block Theme Now in Public Beta\n\n\nWordPress developer Mike McAlister has launched Ollie, his first block theme, into public beta. McAlister, whose theme company Array Themes was acquired by WP Engine in 2018, along with the Atomic Blocks plugin, recently departed from his role at the company to pursue other projects.\nOllie supports all the latest Site Editor features, including global styles,\u00a0patterns,\u00a0templates,\u00a0and template parts. It is a beautiful, multipurpose theme of the high caliber one might expect from McAlister, a veteran developer whose past products were well known for their minimalist and clean design.\n\nOllie includes an impressive set of more than 50 custom block patterns, making page building a delight. There are page sections for testimonials, company logos, multiple hero designs, pricing tables, various headers and footers, calls to action, and more. Ollie includes six different full-page patterns for the homepage, about, profile, features, pricing, and a download page. They are featured on the theme\u2019s live demo under the Patterns menu item.\nOllie includes seven style variations, with blue, green, orange, pink, red, and teal accent color palettes in addition to the default. \nLike many other block themes, Ollie is speedy, getting top scores on Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pagespeed Insights.\n\u201cOne of the most powerful performance features is the selective loading of assets,\u201d McAlister said. \u201cInstead of loading a large stylesheet on every page, Ollie only loads the styles needed on the page. This results in a much smaller page size, far less page requests, and an instantly-loading page, which search engines love.\u201d\nAfter testing Ollie, I found the user experience to be friendly and an accurate representation of one of the taglines for the theme: \u201cGet a 40 hour head start.\u201d As soon as users install the theme and click \u201cCustomize,\u201d they are taken directly to the Site Editor with the front page template pre-populated to match the demo site. This, combined with all the improvements in the Site Editor in WordPress 6.2, creates a smooth editing experience.\n\nAlthough it hasn\u2019t been officially released yet, Ollie could be one of the next majorly successful block themes, with its sheer number of patterns and flexibility for so many different use cases.\nOllie is currently on GitHub during the public beta but McAlister plans to get it approved for WordPress.org after more testing. He is not yet sure whether he will be jumping back into the commercial theme market.\n\u201cWith this first block theme, my goal is simply to learn as much as possible about block themes, how users are using them, and what kind of potential there is for a premium offering,\u201d McAlister told the Tavern. \u201cThis flagship theme will remain as an educational tool and will be free for all to use. Although I have some ideas for monetization, the reality is that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know much about how users will take to block themes or what kind of premium features they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to pay for yet.\n\u201cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very early in this new paradigm, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m taking the opportunity to ask lots of questions learn about the problems users are facing. What I do know is that any modern commercial WordPress product needs a supreme customer experience and a wealth of quality education to help users navigate all of these new features and drive adoption.\u201d\nWordPress.org has 286 block themes available and even the best ones have just a few thousand active installs. Building block themes that people will want to use is a new frontier, even for McAlister whose former company was a war-horse in the Classic Themes era.\n\u201cBlock themes are going to be a game changer for many different personas of WordPress users,\u201d McAlister said. \u201cBeing able to customize virtually every aspect of your site is super powerful, but it means that block themes have a lot more moving parts than classic themes. Theme.json, global styles, patterns, templates, template parts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all of these have to be accounted for and they all have to work together seamlessly for an excellent block theme experience.\u201d\n WordPress theme developers are still getting a handle on these changes but the Themes Team is putting a stake in the ground by making block theming the focus of the Theme Handbook overhaul. Although Classic Themes will still have a chapter in the handbook, the Themes Team has made it clear that block themes are \u201cthe present and future of WordPress.\u201d \n\u201cSince a lot of the block theme building is done in the editor, it requires a new mastery of the editor that few are intimately familiar with yet,\u201d McAlister said. \u201cTo build patterns or layouts, you need to know which blocks to use, how to structure them effectively, how to leverage your design system in theme.json, and you need a good design sense to pull it all together. \n\u201cHowever, when it all finally comes together, block themes provide an unmatched site building and editing experience in comparison to classic themes. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very optimistic about the opportunity to revitalize the WordPress theme space, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take a lot of work and collective education to get there.\u201d\n\nby Sarah Gooding at April 26, 2023 04:20 AM under free wordpress themes\n\n\nApril 25, 2023\nDo The Woo Community: CloudFest, WordPress Day and a Hackathon with Carole Olinger\n\n\nFor WordPress and WooCommerce builders, CloudFest might be an option to consider for your conference calendar. \n>> The post CloudFest, WordPress Day and a Hackathon with Carole Olinger appeared first on Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community\t.\n\nby BobWP at April 25, 2023 12:42 PM under Europe\n\n\nWPTavern: CertifyWP Launches WordPress Management and Design Credential\n\n\nCertifyWP has launched its first credentialing exam for a WordPress Management and Design Credential.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks.\u00a0\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!\n\u00a0[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40] Start of Show\nJust over 50 episodes ago, I shared some basic thoughts about the four freedoms of open source. I also talked through the most quoted phrase in open source\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cfree as in free speech, not free as in beer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And honestly, what podcast about the freedoms of open source would be complete without that? If you haven\u2019t listened to that episode, I suggest you do, but if you don\u2019t have time, I\u2019ll start by reminding us all of the definition of free software, which is most commonly referred to as the four freedoms of open source.\n[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:12]\nSo the first thing is the freedom to run the program as you wish for any purpose. The second thing is the freedom to study how the program works and to change it so that it does your computing as you wish. As a side note, access to the source code is a precondition for this.\u00a0\nThe third freedom is the freedom to redistribute copies so that you can help others. And the fourth freedom is the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes, and of course, also access to the source code is a precondition for this.\u00a0\n[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:47]\nThe TLDR version of these freedoms is, essentially, that users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software. Now, normally when I speak about the freedoms of open source, I\u2019m talking about it either from a practical or a philosophical standpoint, but I also spend a lot of time thinking about it from a leadership and organizational perspective.\nEvery once in a while, you might hear me talk about the effects of \u00e2\u0080\u009copen source at scale,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or you might hear Matt say that the four freedoms are essentially the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBill of Rghts for the open web.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I almost never really dig into either of those topics because it\u2019s just really complicated. But for starters, anytime you talk about what someone is entitled to or deserves or expects, there is a feeling of political bias.\n[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:40]\nAnd while I personally believe that creating software is inherently political or, at a minimum, concerned with the needs of people, that\u2019s not what convinces anyone to participate in open source, and it\u2019s certainly not what convinces people to use WordPress. But here\u2019s the thing, as a leader in a widely used, free, and open source software project, as a leader in WordPress, I also know that every new user to our platform or any other open source platform represents a little more freedom in the world.\nA little more access to tools and jobs that weren\u2019t available before. A slightly more open door to networks that undergird the success of entrepreneurs across the globe and a little more equity to the world of democratizing publishing.\u00a0\n[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:28]\nWhen I look at the four freedoms of open source, this Bill of Rights for the Web, I see not only the freedoms that we should have but also the things that we should have freedom from.\u00a0\nWe should have the freedom to know how our tools work, the freedom to know what information they need from us, and also the freedom to have some way to make that software work specifically for us because that\u2019s why we have software because we have humans that need it. But we should also have freedom from having to hide our hacky enhancements or freedom from fear of losing our earned audience, or even the fear of losing access to copious amounts of content that we have created ourselves over the years.\n[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:13]\nAnd honestly, the things that we should be free from just include a lot of fear of loss. Loss of opportunity or relevance or livelihood. And I feel like for our project, and maybe for open source as a whole, we\u2019re encountering a lot of that right now, whether we are aware of it or not. We\u2019re seeing advancements like GPT3 or ChatGPT if that sounds more familiar and co-pilot.\nAnd while it\u2019s not quite in the same vein, also things like Gutenberg. Advancements that are coming to technology around us, technology we\u2019re familiar with. And it\u2019s hard to see what\u2019s in them sometimes. It\u2019s hard to see what drives them. It\u2019s hard to know how we can make them work for us. So I have to remind us all, as citizens of an open source community, that what protects us from those things we should be free from is directly connected to how active we are in the things we are free to.\u00a0\nWe hear that in a slightly more routine way from folks around open source communities. Basically, the whole concept of open source software is being built by the folks who show up. You can\u2019t influence the future of anything if you\u2019re not showing up in the spaces where the influence happens.\n[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:35]\nSo be an active participant in these new technologies. Learn how GPT works and how it could work for you, even if it\u2019s just writing better prompts. Learn how Gutenberg can support your needs, not subvert your needs, even if it\u2019s just learning how to arrange a series of blocks into a pattern or patterns into a page.\nBut as with all fast-moving technological advances, I encourage you to leap in feet first, not head first. Get in up to your neck in the \u201cwhy\u201ds and \u201chow\u201ds of that new technology you\u2019ve been worrying about. Be the first to become best at this arcane new thing because that\u2019s why we open source at all so that you have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve your software.\u00a0\n[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:33] Small List of Big Things\nThat brings me now to my small list of big things. It\u2019s a very small list, but it is very big, as always. The first thing is that we are gearing up for the remaining major releases of the year, WP 6.3 and 6.4 in an atypical moment for our project. You can volunteer for both simultaneously if you want, and hopefully, you do want.\nSecond thing is that there are many ways to celebrate WordPress\u2019s 20th anniversary on May 27th. But one of the things you can do right now is record a short video or sound clip about a great memory or experience you have had in this community or just generally because of WordPress. Those will be featured on the WP 20 website, and maybe even a lucky few will make it into the second volume of the WordPress history book.\nAnd that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I\u2019m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I\u2019ll see you again in a couple of weeks.\u00a0\n\nby Chloe Bringmann at April 24, 2023 01:55 PM under wp-briefing\n\n\nApril 22, 2023\nGutenberg Times: Gutenberg Changelog #82 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Gutenberg 15.6 and proposed schedule for WordPress 6.3\n\n\nNick Diego and Birgit Pauli-Haack discuss the most recent Gutenberg plugin release 15.6, the proposed schedule for WordPress 6.3 release in August of this year and a few things that are in the works. \nShow Notes / Transcript\n\nMusic:\u00a0Homer Gaines\nEditor:\u00a0Sandy Reed\nLogo:\u00a0Mark Uraine\nProduction:\u00a0Birgit Pauli-Haack\n\nSpecial Guest: Nick Diego\n\nFollow on Twitter: @nickmdiego\nWordPress.org: Nick Diego\n\nAnnouncements\n\nWordPress 6.3 Planning Proposal & Call for Volunteers\nPreparing for the Next Women & Nonbinary Release Squad\n\n\nFSE Program Exploration: Build a block theme\nFSE Program Testing Call #21: Front Page Fun\nUsing template patterns to build multiple homepage designs (Dev Blog) \n\nCommunity Contributions\nGiveWP: Visual Donation Form Builder in Beta\nBring me your Issues with Ryan Welcher\n\nBring me your Issues #1\nBring me your Issues #2\nBring me your Issues #3\nTooling: Using Create-Block Scaffolding and 3rd Party Templates\n\nGutenberg 15.6\n\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new in Gutenberg 15.6?

In today\u2019s episode, we will talk about the Gutenberg plugin version 15.6, the proposed schedule for WordPress 6.3, and a few things that are in the works again. I\u2019m your host Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source Project. I\u2019m thrilled to have with me today, co-host Nick Diego, plugin developer, core contributor as well, and we are both part of Automattic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Five for the Future project. Nick and I teamed up to manage the Gutenberg plugin release 15.6, so this is fresh from the press, so to speak. Thanks for joining me today again at the Gutenberg Changelog. Nick, how are you today?\nNick Diego: I\u2019m doing great. I\u2019m very excited that 15.6 is out in the wild now.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, me too. And this is a daily dose of Nick Diego for me because the last two days we were in communication about the release.\u00a0\nAnnouncements\nBut before we head into the Gutenberg 15.6 release, let\u2019s do a few announcements from the WordPress project. As mentioned in the intro, the release schedule for WordPress 6.3 proposal is published and includes a call for volunteers for the release squad. A beta is proposed to be, beta one, is proposed to be on June 27th, 2023. So it\u2019s after WordCamp and \u00e2\u0080\u009cafter after\u00e2\u0080\u009d WordCamp, so to speak, WordCamp Europe. Release candidate and dev notes. Deadline is proposed for July 18th, 2023, and then the final release is proposed to be scheduled on August 8th, 2023. So you raised your hand right, Nick? I raised my hand.\nNick Diego: I did. Yeah. Yes, exactly. So yeah, I\u2019ve been in the editor triage lead for the last three-year releases and it was a new role when I started. I\u2019d love to help somebody grow into that role because I love doing it, but we want to see other people in that role as well. And I think it\u2019s a fun role. It\u2019s pretty unique. Yeah, it\u2019s not very technical. It\u2019s more organizational and just engaging with other release leads and kind of keeping everything moving smoothly. So it\u2019s a great lead for somebody who maybe is not as technical but wants to really engage with the release.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah. Yeah, I want to change my role. The last three releases, I did documentation pieces and especially the Gutenberg dev notes wrangle them through GitHub and that is definitely something that somebody that is not technical can do as well. I\u2019m open to mentor somebody for 6.3 and the proposal for the schedule comes actually on the heels of Josepha Haden Chomphosy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s post, which preparing for the next women and non-binary release squad, AKA underrepresented gender squad.\nAnd if you want to be part of it, you can raise your hands in the comments there. And of course we have the links and show notes, but if you haven\u2019t worked on the major WordPress release squad before, it would be really good and you want to be part of the underrepresented gender squad, it would be good that you also look at the schedule for 6.3 and raise your hand there because quite a few mentors would be available to skill up contributors to be part of 6.4 because that\u2019s how you get new people in that you need to\u2026 We need to shepherd them through the responsibilities and how things work and who to talk to and how this all\u2026 It can be very intimidating when you haven\u2019t done this before.\nSo not to throw you into the deep end of the water to swim.\nNick Diego: It\u2019s always good to see how the sausage is made and there\u2019s so much going on and so many people involved. I know when I first did it, I was very intimidated, but after you see it once, it starts to make a bit more sense. So yeah, mentor for 6.3 and then get really well-prepared for 6.4.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah. Yeah. And if you want to learn more, yeah, you find us on Twitter or on the WordPress Slack and you can just kind of DM us or ask us some questions there. Well, I volunteered you now. Big sorry.\nNick Diego: Yeah. Oh, if anybody has any questions about the release, feel free to reach out to us. We\u2019re here to help, here to get more people on board with the release. I know for myself, it kind of kicked off my journey in contributing more to WordPress and it really made me kind of fall in love with the process. And so I highly encourage anybody else who might be even a little bit interested to start exploring it.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: And if you want to help the quality race on some of the products, you can also follow the FSE outreach program that has been in place for two and a half years almost. And there is, Anne McCarthy runs the program and you still have until April 26th to follow the testing call number 20. And that is using the create block theme plugin to create a block theme and you get some instructions on the call for testing. It\u2019s another six days, but if you are not so much into theme development, maybe you want to do the new call for testing that just came out and have some front page fun with a block scene and create some templates that are for the front page. And there is actually also a developer news blog out, blog post out that just came out last week, and that is by Justin Tadlock using the template patterns to build multiple homepage designs. So I don\u2019t know exactly if they\u2019re related, but I\u2019m pointing you to it as well, so you get a little bit broader picture of it. Yes.\nNick Diego: And I want to stress that these call for testings, even if you\u2019ve been building with blocks forever and you\u2019re very engaged, it\u2019s a great exercise to go through. I consider myself very entrenched in WordPress and know what\u2019s going on, but sometimes when you go through these testing calls, you find pitfalls or issues that somebody who\u2019s maybe brand new to blocks would encounter. It\u2019s a great way to find problems or things that can be fixed to make that onboarding experience smoother. So I know I always find things that I don\u2019t expect, but the goal of these call for testing is to make WordPress better. And so even if you use WordPress every day, I encourage you.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, that\u2019s a good point. Absolutely. And if I want to get something done on my theme, for instance, for the Gutenberg Times or for my personal blog and try to do this, I always find something that might be a little quirky, that might be a little bit, oh, I haven\u2019t thought about that, but now that I use it, maybe there are some things that could be easier to handle or more intuitive or I run into some problems.\nIt\u2019s so fresh from out of the releases that there\u2019s always\u2026 There is no bug free software. That ship has sailed when we so many people are involved. All right.\nNick Diego: Absolutely.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah. But that\u2019s also something if I get asked, I want to contribute to WordPress, but I don\u2019t know how. So I\u2019ll appoint them to the testing calls because it\u2019s gets them hands-on with the WordPress site and also contribute back by just giving feedback. You don\u2019t have to know the processes. You don\u2019t need to know any development, but when something doesn\u2019t work right and you can raise your hand and say, I found something and explain that to other people. And Anne has been very good in creating GitHub issues for the developers and to feed that back into the development process.\nNick Diego: Absolutely.\nCommunity Contributions\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: For the community contribution, I wanted to point out Ryan Welcher started a new series on his Twitch stream and it\u2019s called Bring Me Your Issues. And he uploaded the first of the few issues for persistence on YouTube, and I wanted to point you to it. He also went through the work and added chapter timestamps to it, and especially for the first one that was really helpful because that\u2019s a two and a half hour Twitch session. I really admire his persistence and his patience.\nSo you can look through the list of the topics that he covered and one of them\u2026 So I can only say three things, but that it was more so how to use the create block scaffolding tool. It\u2019s always interesting to see that and how to build an edit block for the lockdown user. So edit post block I should say. And that\u2019s certainly something that could come to core, but if it\u2019s easier\u2026 Yeah, relatively easy to build, you can build it yourself. Then he answers the question, what and why inner blocks, which is a component that is for block building. And then another question is how to create a placeholder and parent and child relationships for your block development and using the example of a post pickup block. Yeah.\nNick Diego: It\u2019s a goldmine of tools and how to do different things, so if you haven\u2019t checked out Ryan\u2019s streams, you definitely should.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, and there\u2019s a second edition of it, where you can learn more about the get post type selectors in the data store and the use entity records, all technical terms, that you will know so easy after you listen to that. The render appender, I like that. The render appender on the inner box. And then in the third edition here, Ryan also talks a little bit over the Gutenberg 15.5 release and how to create a external template for APIs for the great block scaffolding tool. Always a good thing to know so you can create your own templates for the tool. There was actually also a topic at one of our Gutenberg live Q&As was Grzegorz Ziolkowski and Fabian Kagy. It\u2019s a couple of years old, but it\u2019s still very, very current with demos and additional background on how to create those templates. So we share all this in the show notes. I know it\u2019s a little bit tech and developer happy, heavy, happy too, but I just wanted to point out these new resources and additional resources.\nNick Diego: Yeah, absolutely.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: So GiveWP published a block-based visual donation form builder. That\u2019s a mouthful, and it\u2019s in beta. So GiveWP has, in an earlier episode, we discussed GiveWP\u2019s way to rebuild the powerful donation plugin with our block first mindset and starting off with a WordPress native components and scripts to build the interface and only use custom code to augment it. And the visual donation form builder, it\u2019s getting better, is the first product that comes from this effort. And if you work for an agency that helps nonprofits fundraise using the GiveWP Plugin, this beta is definitely for you. It\u2019s also for you when you are working at a nonprofit organization and you are responsible for the fundraising and creating the campaign-related forms. This is also a beta for you. So it gives you early insight in what\u2019s coming to GiveWP in the version 3.0. And it also gives you a better feel for what will be possible with a new form builder that isn\u2019t available right now. So check it out, GiveWP. We have the link definitely in the show notes to the beta announcement, and that\u2019s it from our community contributions.\nNick Diego: Lots of good stuff.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Released \u2013 Gutenberg 15.6\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah. So what\u2019s released this week? We have Gutenberg 15.6 and we are coming right from it. It was released yesterday and the release post is also available now. It includes a total of 112 PRs. It\u2019s a smaller release in comparison to the ones that come closer to a major WordPress release. It was authored by 45 contributors and seven of which were new contributors. So congratulations everyone on the good work and let\u2019s get into what\u2019s in there. And we\u2019re starting out with, we now have spacing presets to the spacer block.\nNick Diego: Yeah, this is what I\u2019m so excited about. We\u2019ve had\u2026 Since 6.1, presets were added to WordPress, which allow you to do a little slider for margin and padding and block app. It\u2019s configuring margin or padding can be kind of complicated, but when you have a preset of small, medium, large or 1-2-3-4-5, it just makes it a little bit easier for the user. And the way that you could apply those, is you could actually make them fluid, using clamp to make them fluid, which allows for really interesting designs that don\u2019t require media queries because you can make all your one margin for desktop, another for mobile. We didn\u2019t have that for the spacer block, which adds vertical height between different blocks. So if you had a hundred pixel spacer block, you wanted it to be smaller on mobile, you would need to use custom CSS.\nWell, now spacing presets come to the spacer block, which also in turn allows for fluid spacer blocks, which people have been asking for forever. Because the spacer block is such a natural tool. It\u2019s so easy to add for end users. It makes sense. I want to add some space between these two items. Okay, add the spacer block, but now that they\u2019re fluid\u2026 Now that you can make them fluid, it allows for dynamic websites where you have one size on desktop, another for tablet and another for mobile. And it\u2019s all on this fluid spectrum and you don\u2019t need media queries. You don\u2019t need anything else. You\u2019re just using these spacing presets. So I couldn\u2019t be more excited. I\u2019ve only have just began exploring this and I know other theme developers are as well, so exciting stuff.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: Awesome. Yeah, thank you so much for telling us about it. I also want to point out a blog post that\u2019s on the developer blog and it kind of talks about that fluid part of intrinsic design versus media queries for theming and thinking about how designing WordPress makes it a little bit more modern when you\u2026 Because the proliferation of screen sizes, you are probably not very content with just three media or three sets. You might need 12 sets or 6 sets, and who keeps track of all the different settings for all these presets? Intrinsic design, that\u2019s a fluid typography. That\u2019s a fluid spacing. It\u2019s definitely a way to go.\nIt doesn\u2019t say that you cannot have any media queries, but it\u2019s definitely for the strategic way to build websites. It\u2019s the way to go now.\nNick Diego: Definitely.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: And then we had, the cover block had border support, but now you also have these pop over resizable box and I think it also was in 15.5, but cover block has now a great border support. You can have the radios. You can have the colors. You can have the resizable block kind of\u2026 Resizable blocks adhered to those. Yeah, that was really nice when I tested it. I\u2019m not quite sure that\u2019s 5.6 native, but it\u2019s definitely improved with 15.6\nNick Diego: In 16.1, we did a huge effort to add all these design tools to most blocks, but border was left off a handful of them. One of them being cover block because of the clipping so if you did a background image and you tried to put border radius on it, you\u2019d need to use overflow. It just became tricky with CSS and it took some more time to figure out how to implement that correctly. And so we finally got there and I think that this has been one of those things, why isn\u2019t there border control? I thought, well, it was a little more tricky than we expected. So it\u2019s nice to see it here and it really opens up a lot of designs and again, removes some extra custom CSS that you may have needed in the past to achieve a specific design.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: So next thing on the list of change of was, add styles section to the\u2026 Well, they call it browse mode sidebar, but it\u2019s the style editor of the style. Well, somebody called it site editor dark side as well, so which I don\u2019t feel slightly better. It\u2019s the left sidebar that is on the site editor. And now there is a style section where you can see all the styles that come with the theme, the style variations, and when you click on it, you see how your site changes, but there\u2019s also an edit button there. So you can then go and open up the right side and change some of the settings for the style variation. And that is a very fluid workflow. I really love that. And it\u2019s now in the Gutenberg plugin, so it\u2019s really cool.\nNick Diego: Before you had to know where the style variations were. You had to click into the template, then go to the style panel. And so this just makes it much more surfaced for users, allowing you to easily switch your style variation out. Great improvement, and also that name to be determined left-hand sidebar. That will get more features as we go on as well. But this is one additional addition beyond templates and template parts and navigation.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: Those are the four main items right now. Yeah, navigation, global styles, template and template parts. And there might be a pattern in the future.\nNick Diego: Hopefully.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: Hopefully. Yes, yes, yes. And then in Gutenberg 15.6, there\u2019s also two experiments. One is a new block that the details and summary block, which mostly was working by Carolina Nymark and she did a fantastic job, shepherding that for maybe a year until it actually got merged as an experiment into the plugin. It\u2019s how you can hide things. You write a movie review and you want to hide the spoiler part where you reveal some of the drama in the movie, but you want your users to know or readers to know that you making a choice here. You open it up and it\u2019s a spoiler. You can also hide some details on certain things. There are numerous of use cases and it\u2019s quite nice because it has all the design tools. It has the typography. It has the spacing. It has the backgrounds, the colors. So it\u2019s actually a nice little block and it can use some testing, but you need to go to the menu of the Gutenberg plugin into the experiments and check it on. Yeah. Have you used it Nick?\nNick Diego: Yeah, I played around with it quite a bit. I think that the colloquial term would be an accordion, is basically kind of what we\u2019re talking about here. It\u2019s really hard to do in an accessible way, which is one of the reasons why this has taken so long to get into WordPress. Core, that is. And so I think Carolina did a great job. The current experimental implementation includes a number of a parent block and then a number of child blocks. There\u2019s another exploration that\u2019s maybe trying to simplify that. But either way, we\u2019re getting closer and closer to having this block and core and it\u2019s something that everybody\u2019s asked for. So why isn\u2019t this in core? We want this in core. So it\u2019s, it will get there and I think this is a great first step. Encourage everybody to try out the experiment. Find problems with it. Find out how we can make it better.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah. Excellent. And then there\u2019s another experiment. It\u2019s called a command center for the site editor. And that is really a rough interface right now if you switch it on. Yeah, don\u2019t expect too much user-friendliness in there because it\u2019s still in an experimental way. So if I understood this correctly, you get a little search bar like the spotlight on a Mac or so, and then you can say edit something or change color or so and it will get you to the place where you can actually do that. So you wouldn\u2019t need to know all the 15 levels of menus to get to a certain place. I have not played with it. Did you test it a bit?\nNick Diego: Yes, so we\u2019ve been all hearing about artificial intelligence these days. AI is everywhere, and this is not AI, but it\u2019s an experiment to start exploring one, how you can move things around. How you can move around the site. You could tell it, I want to add a new page, but you can also start to see where in the future you could hook in\u2026 third-party extenders could hook in a different additional functionality into this command center to do, write me a post about Mars, whatever. You can start to think about where this could eventually go, which is why this is currently an experiment, but the baseline is going to be take me to the styles panel, add a new page, simple things. But it could be huge. It could be a really important component of what WordPress is. And so really test it out, start exploring it. The idea behind it is it\u2019s going to be very extensible, so you can add additional functionality as a third-party extender. So really excited to see where this goes.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, me too. And then there are quite a few, I call them or we call them here, quality of life kind of enhancements you don\u2019t know that you need it until you see that what you get. And one of them is the smoother animations for the drop zone and what is a drop zone? It\u2019s not a movie thing. You go from drag and drop and to drop, you need to know where you it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is actually going on your canvas and the animation that\u2026 So there\u2019s a blue line appearing on your canvas and it tells you, okay, your drop thingy will drop here when you release the button if you wanted to. And the animations are much smoother. It\u2019s actually a delightful experience now to drag and drop blocks from one section to the other or from the list view over\u2026 From the list view over to your canvas. So that\u2019s a very nice addition there.\nNick Diego: Yeah, it\u2019s really nice. And then there\u2019s some improvements to list view itself around dragging. I\u2019ve run into it too. You see sometimes you drag items within the list view and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u2026 Things don\u2019t go exactly where you want them to. And one of those was dragging underneath a container like a group block was a little challenging. And then they\u2019ve improved that as well. So dragging and dropping and got it much easier across the board.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, and that I think were all the highlights that we wanted to point out today from the Gutenberg 15.6 release. We will have the release post in the show notes so you can follow up on things.\u00a0\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in Active Development or Discussed\nAnd now we want to talk to you about what\u2019s in active development and what\u2019s coming down the line. And first off is the work with patterns. So I hear this over and over again. I want to create my own patterns. Why can\u2019t I do this with WordPress? I need a plugin. And we know all the good plugins. There\u2019s a, Justin Tadlock had a plugin to create patterns and Block Meister was one, and then WP Engine came out with a pattern builder. And so Ari has a work in progress to add UI to allow saving patterns. And we definitely share that and it\u2019s coming along fine, but it\u2019s still a work in progress. And I don\u2019t know what are the problems they\u2019re hitting? Do you have a feeling on how that\u2019s difficult?\nNick Diego: Well, I think it\u2019s one of those things where we have all sorts of different entities in the block editor. We have reusable blocks. We have templates. We have template parts. What do you use when? What do you use where? And so I think that not only the functionality of being able to save a pattern, but also the UI around saving a pattern and making it clear to users when you should use one over the other and in what context things should be used. So there\u2019s a technical issue and then there\u2019s also a UI understanding user experience issue as well. So it\u2019s getting there. It\u2019s great to see this happening in core patterns are such a great way to create content and then use it in different places. And being able to do that in core would be such a huge benefit. It would allow you to design something, save it as a pattern, go to a different page, use your pattern. There\u2019s just so many delightful applications of this and really excited to see it moving forward.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, it definitely needs to be in there. And there\u2019s also a work done on the WP pattern block, which allows you to create patterns or use patterns in template parts. So that\u2019s also reusable designs that are already available to use them in templates, so you can reuse, have them on every type of page that you want to be on. That is also in the works. It definitely comes together with the UI for the patterns as well. So look out, we have the links for the PRs, will be in the show notes, so if you want to check it out and keep a tab on it, feel free to do those.\nNick Diego: Yeah, and I think that the long and short of it is patterns are under the hood a very simple thing. It\u2019s just a collection of blocks. And the initial implementation of patterns was just that. It was a collection of blocks that you could deploy in different places. Now that people are starting to expand and adopt block-based WordPress, it\u2019s become very clear how powerful patterns can be. And now we\u2019re seeing all these like, well, can it do this? Can it do this? Can we do it here? Yeah. And so we\u2019re trying to address those things.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: And I just want to\u2026 Just had the idea, we talked about pattern before and I pitched that developer news post where you can have patterns for particular templates, and that\u2019s also part of that idea where you can expand. How you can use it. How can theme developers support users in creating what they need to create on their websites and be fast with that? Yeah. So that\u2019s also part, yeah.\nAnother thing that was definitely had a lot of questions and a lot of requests was getting revisions on the global styles for the interface. So contributors look to implement revisions and display them in the global styles. There\u2019s current and experimental implementation that shows a separate revision menu item in the global styles. And when you selected, you can see the latest revisions, the preview of them in the editor, and you can also go back to the latest revision and change it again. Or there is also a restore of unsafe changes and also a reset to the science of the theme. So there was, the design team did lot of thinking about how that can be displayed. And now developers are working on some iterations on the PR before it\u2019s merged. And it will certainly need some thorough testing, but I wanted listeners to know that that is coming as well.\nNick Diego: Yeah, revisions are such a big thing when you make those changes in the site editor can be a little discerning because you\u2019re like, I\u2019m making all these changes. How do I get back? How do I get back to a design that I liked before and it was clicking the back button a million times or just a little\u2026 It was tough. So there\u2019s a revision, especially visual revisions where you can go back and see what the changes that were made I think is going to be really important for broader adoption of the site editor. So great to see.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, definitely. And when users do make their own designs or make changes on their design, sometimes they don\u2019t know what the final design looks like until they actually have it and then they don\u2019t like it anymore and then they need to go back and that these revisions definitely will help with that process. I\u2019m that way. Yeah.\nNick Diego: Oh, yeah.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: And the last item that I have in the list for, or we have in the list for you to learn that is discussed and in the works is again, a little bit more developer oriented, but now there is a PR one issue discussed on how to get allowed blocks into the blockchain meta. It is an attribute for the inner block. So if you have a custom block and you want other blocks in there, you can restrict which blocks can be put in there, but you are not able to add this to your\u2026 A data point to your outside block. And that is something especially for developers that restrict them or they find solutions around it. And if you\u2026 Yeah, one is if you want to restrict an instance of the media and text block, that it only can do heading, paragraph, and image, but you can tell the media and text block that is what you want them to put in there. So developers do all kinds of interesting things to work around this, but there should be a standard in core and the developers are working on it.\nNick Diego: Yeah, I\u2019d love to see this extensibility. When the block editor is being built, obviously, you need the core components to be built, but I think we\u2019re finally out of time where a lot of things are stable and now is really how do we allow people to make changes, extend different components. One of the beauties of WordPress. You can change anything. You can configure it in many ways and getting some of that configurability into more configurability into the block editor is great. So these little things that may seem minor have huge impacts for developers\u2019 lives and what they\u2019re trying to implement. So great to see this happening.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: And I was thinking about, well, this is an issue that\u2019s discussed for four years now. And finally there are enough use cases, there have been enough ways to use the block editor and extend an editor, and now there\u2019s a real need there to actually have that discussion come to fruition into a PR or into a new feature that helps the developers to extend things. And I think we will see through the year of 2023, the next two major WordPress releases, certainly additional things that add more extensibility to the block editor, especially to the site editor and to custom blocks. And it\u2019s exciting times and I\u2019m really glad that we are there now just before the next phase of Gutenberg.\nYeah, absolutely. And with that, dear listeners, we are at the end of the show. It was a shorter show, but I\u2019m glad I had Nick with me for you and could talk to you about a few things that are beyond the Gutenberg plugin release.\u00a0\nSo before the end of the show. I remind you if you want to help WordPress get better, heed the call for testing, either building a block theme with a block plugin in the 20th testing call or rating front pages, different kind of front page for your website. So anything else that you want to add to things that we haven\u2019t talked about that you were top of your mind?\nNick Diego: No, just encourage people to go check out 15.6 and that call for testing. Embrace blocks and try to push the block editor to his limits. And if there are issues, let us know and we\u2019ll help make it better.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: All right, so you changed jobs, Nick? Have anything but you are not new to our listeners. That\u2019s why we kind of cut through the introduction a little bit. But have anything\u2026 If people want to get in touch with you, has anything changed?\nNick Diego: Nope. The best place usually is just on Twitter or obviously WordPress Slack at NDiego. On Twitter, NickMDiego. So feel free to reach out to me with your questions, comments, suggestions about WordPress. Here to help.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: And we have a new video of you, Fluid Spaces.\nNick Diego: Yeah, I\u2019m going to make more of those. I\u2019m going to be trying to do more little shorts about different features that come out in WordPress so we\u2019ll see how that goes.\nBirgit Pauli-Haack: And the first one is out today and we will have the link in the show notes and it talks about the spacers, spacer block. And so let Nick know what you think about and what your ideas are for new little shorts.\u00a0\nAs always, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is the 82nd edition or episode. And if you have questions or suggestions or news you want to send, include them to changelog@gutenbergtimes.com. That\u2019s changelog@Gutenbergtimes.com. Thank you everybody, and I wish you a great weekend and a new weekend of spring eternal. Hopefully, and the weather getting better and talk to you in two weeks. Bye-bye.\nNick Diego: Bye-bye.\n\nby Gutenberg Changelog at April 22, 2023 09:15 PM under WordPress\n\n\nWPTavern: Virtuozzo Launches Version 2.0 of Its Application Platform for WordPress\n\n\nVirtuozzo, the software company behind the virtualization and cloud management capabilities of many popular hosting service providers, has launched version 2.0 of its WordPress platform.

In a recent update, Yoast-sponsored core contributor Ari Stathopoulos said the SQLite Database Integration feature plugin has been rewritten, with the help of Automattic-sponsored core contributor Adam Zielinski, to be a more future-proof implementation.\n\u201cThe code has been completely rewritten to use an SQL Lexer and is now stable and able to handle all WordPress queries properly,\u201d Stathopoulos said. \u201cThe SQL Lexer is part of the\u00c2\u00a0PHPMyAdmin/SQL-Parser\u00c2\u00a0project (licensed under the\u00c2\u00a0GPL\u00c2\u00a02.0) and it was adapted for WordPress, effectively implementing a\u00c2\u00a0MySQL to SQLite translation engine. This provides improved security, as well as compatibility.\u201d\nStathopoulos contends that the next step is to implement these changes in WordPress core \u201cinstead of using a plugin,\u201d because in its current form it can only be tested on pre-existing websites that already have a MySQL database.\n\u201cUsing the\u00c2\u00a0featured\u00c2\u00a0plugin is a great way to allow users to test the implementation and iron out any issues etc,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, long-term, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense to use it as a plugin.\u201d\u00c2\u00a0\nStathopoulos created a draft Pull Request\u00c2\u00a0and an accompanying\u00c2\u00a0Trac ticket proposing the new implementation be merged into core.\nAlthough the effort has received positive feedback and support from the community and WordPress lead developer Matt Mullenweg, the feature plugin has only 30 active installs and the new implementation has received very little testing.\nMultiple participants in the discussion, including core committer Aaron Jorbin and lead developer Andrew Ozz, expressed concerns about the proposal\u2019s call for merging the changes to core as the next step. \n\u201cTalk of merging to\u00c2\u00a0core\u00c2\u00a0feels incredibly premature for a couple of reasons,\u201d Jorbin said. \u201cThe\u00c2\u00a0plugin\u00c2\u00a0now only has around 30 installations. I think there needs to be much higher adoption in order to understand how the near-infinite number of plugins will work with this deep underlying change to WordPress.\u201d\nJorbin also referenced WordPress\u2019 philosophy of building things for end users who don\u2019t want to have to make decisions about the underlying tech but simply want things to work.\n\u201cAssuming that a user is going to understand different database engines and the potential tradeoffs feels far stretched to me,\u201d Jorbin said. \u201cTherefore, any implementation really needs to be rock solid and extremely thoroughly tested.\u201d\nJorbin also echoed concerns of other contributors in previous conversations, about SQLite\u2019s bizarre religion-infused \u201ccode of ethics.\u201d\nOzz suggested the plugin could be added to WordPress as a mu-plugin or a \u201cdrop-in\u201d similar to how caching add-ons are implemented, pushing back on the rigidity of the requirement to fully merge it into core.\n\u201cBoth of these methods are also better/more suitable for the users as they can be done by the hosting company or the script used for WordPress installation,\u201d Ozz said. \u201cThere are some other benefits like independent updates, etc.\u201d\nStathopoulos responded to these concerns, saying that he sees the merge to core as a long-term goal, although the proposal communicated more of an urgency that confused participants in the discussion.\n\u201cIt is premature,\u201d Stathopoulos admitted. \u201cHowever, looking at the bigger picture, it is not premature to plan for the future and get ready for it.\n\u201cIt may be premature now, but it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be 2 years from now\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 The problem is that we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to do it in the future unless we start working on it now.SQLite is not something that can \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or should \u00e2\u0080\u0093 happen in Core now, or even a year from now. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long-term goal, and should be treated as such.\u201d\nStathopoulos agreed that the plugin needs more adoption to see how it works with plugins across the ecosystem. He also responded to concerns about users not fully understanding the implications of the database engine they select on installation.\n\u201cThe proof-of-concept\u00c2\u00a0UI\u00c2\u00a0I put in place in the Core PR is just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a proof of concept,\u201d  Stathopoulos said. \u201cSomething to trigger discussion and allow us to find solutions. It can be anything, even installation scenarios (do you want to create a\u00c2\u00a0blog? A small e-commerce site? A large news outlet? The next Amazon?) That is a discussion that will need to happen when the time is right to discuss UI, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is a bit too early for that, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re there yet.\u201d\nStathopoulos recommends contributors test the new implementation with all the plugins they normally use, via the SQLite Database Integration plugin or by testing the\u00c2\u00a0draft pull request in WordPress Core.\n\nby Sarah Gooding at April 21, 2023 09:37 PM under Plugins\n\n\nWordCamp Central: WordCamp Jinja 2023: Empowering the Future Generation of WordPress Users in Africa\n\n\n\nInaugural WordCamp Jinja 2022 attendees in the Computer Lab at Jinja College School on 2nd Sept 2022.\nAt the heart of every revolution lies a spark that ignites the collective spirit, driving the wheels of change and inspiring the future.

Once enabled, it can be used to toggle the visibility of hidden content. This can be useful for presenting things like text transcripts for video blocks or simple spoiler alerts. By default the toggle is open in the block editor but closed on the front end. This is the first iteration, so the behavior of the toggle is still somewhat rough.\nAnother interesting experiment that shipped in version 15.6 is a command center for the Site Editor. It was created to be a quick search for jumping to other pages or templates in the editor. \n\u201cThis can be seen as a start on an extensible command and quick search component that can be used for way-finding (go to About page;\u00c2\u00a0edit Archive template) and running commands (toggle top toolbar; etc),\u201d Gutenberg lead architect Matias Ventura said in the ticket outlining the feature. \u201cThe first milestone is to power quick search for content and templates within the site editor.\u201d\nGutenberg engineer Riad Benguella said his goal with the initial PR is to build the APIs and components for the command center but not necessarily implement all the commands. Ultimately he aims for this feature to do the following:\n\nThe command center can be loaded in any WPAdmin page\nThe commands and the command center are independent: Commands can be registered dynamically depending on the context\nSome small hierarchy of commands to be able to organize the items\nAllowing dynamic searches for commands\n\nGutenberg contributors are still considering how to organize and display commands better based on context, which is one reason why this feature remains behind the Experiments flag.\nVersion 15.6 also brings spacing presets to the Spacer block settings, allowing theme authors to create sensible presets and users to adjust spacing in a way that will look good across devices.\n\u201cSince the introduction of spacing presets, it became clear from community feedback that\u00c2\u00a0spacing presets\u00c2\u00a0should also be available for the Height control in the Spacer block,\u201d WordPress developer advocate Birgit Pauli-Haack said in the release post. \u201cThis\u00c2\u00a0enhancement\u00c2\u00a0in 15.6 gives theme developers much more flexibility over how spacing is applied throughout a site and enables fluid Spacer blocks.\u201d\n\nWordPress core contributor Nick Diego filmed a short video about spacing presets for the Spacer block, which demonstrates how fluid spacing work to help a site\u2019s content and design adapt better to different viewports.\n\nGutenberg 15.6 came out yesterday, and one of my favorite new features is spacing presets for the Spacer block.Fluid spacers anyone?  pic.twitter.com/k9NJSy05Xd\u2014 Nick Diego (@nickmdiego) April 20, 2023\n\nA few other highlights in Gutenberg 15.6 include the following:\n\nAdds border support to the Cover block\nMakes Style Variations accessible in Browse Mode\nList View now allows dragging underneath collapsed non-empty container blocks\nSmoother animations for Drop Zone in the canvas\n\nCheck out the changelog to see all the enhancements, bug fixes, and performance and tooling updates.\n\nby Sarah Gooding at April 20, 2023 10:15 PM under News\n\n\nPost Status: Launching a WordPress Product in Public: Session 10\n\n\nCorey Maass and Cory Miller look to the future of WordPress as they continue the development of their new WordPress plugin, Crop.Express.

Um, so it makes it really nice to stream YouTube. Um, okay, sosession 10. Now turn off YouTube. Um, so session 10, we\u2019re talking, um, last week we saidwe\u2019re good on the version for Crop Dotted Express, and we had saw a new direction with theproject you had been working on anyway. Mm-hmm. And we spent some time just privatelydiscussing that.And so, um, we were just chatting in the pre-roll before this about okay is, you know, building itin public, but we\u2019re, we\u2019ve pa not paused, we\u2019ve put a bow on that one and said, okay, there\u2019ssomething else here. And now it\u2019s time to kind of explore that and figure out what\u2019s, what couldthat product be. [00:01:00] Um, you just had a couple really good, um, comments about thatwhole process of here\u2019s that one, but we\u2019re going onto this next one.Hmm. Can you share some of that you\u2019re just sharing with me? Cause I think it\u2019s really goodand I don\u2019t want to Sure. Oh, your butcher, you\u2019re your top.Corey Maass: Um, so, uh, for the sake of accountability, I do wanna say that Crop express, uh,is pending a read me update that you and I worked on, I think last time. And there are a coupleof tweaks to make to the product itself.The plugin itself. To in fact put a bow on it cuz I wanted it. It\u2019s gonna be, you know, so, so a littledigression here. It\u2019s very easy for, uh, any product team as we now are to go, uh, that wasyesterday\u2019s new shiny, [00:02:00] today\u2019s new shinies over there. Um, and if we are notabandoning crop express, which we are not, then it\u2019s important that I sit down at some point andactually put a bow on it.And we don\u2019t just keep saying we\u2019re gonna put a bow on it and let it ride, but, um, you know, letit be a whole product unto itself. I think that\u2019s important. So that\u2019s on my list. Um, but yeah, we,in, in the process of talking about crop express and where the value add is, um, one of thethings that you talked about really well, um, is the, Difference between, you had a little graphicthat, you know, pain solving a pain versus adding value.Um, and obviously these things are not mutually exclusive by any stretch, but, um, crop Expresssolved a problem for us. That\u2019s why, why we started the conversation in the first place. I built thislittle web utility. You went, holy crap, this [00:03:00] needs to be in WordPress. Uh, and thatlaunched our journey, but we kept having these great meta conversations about image imagesin WordPress as a whole.And one of the things, problems that I\u2019ve been struggling with for a while, for my own blog andagain for, um, client sites, not only is it cropping images correctly, which solves a pain point,ideally, um, but is you write a blog post and, and then what? Right. You need other assets to goalong with it. Uh, and then in a perfect, you know, so we\u2019re talking, now we\u2019re talking aboutmarketing, right?We\u2019re talking about marketing assets, things to put on Twitter, images to put on Twitter imagesto put on Instagram, and, and having to go over to Canva to do that or some other tool. Um, andso now we\u2019re talking [00:04:00] about that, which is, you know, there is pain involved. These areextra steps, but it\u2019s the difference between, to me, you know, the difference between trying towrite a, a basic blog post with an image inward press, and that it\u2019s.You get to the end of the words and you\u2019re like, oh, this is such a pain. I need to do somethingwith an image and leave WordPress. Versus traditionally, I think we\u2019d write a blog post inWordPress and then go, okay, the WordPress part is done. Now let me jump over to Canva,Photoshop, whatever it is to generate these other images.Um, and so now we\u2019re sort of switching over to a value add potentially.Cory Miller: Yeah. I, um, most of my product experience is in the pain threshold. Um, you know,backup, security, all that, you know, updating stuff, very [00:05:00] utilitarian, um, practicalthings, and I really appreciate it. That\u2019s part of my personality too. I like utility things. You know,there\u2019s this pin, for instance, is the big. A pin.And in my belief, there\u2019s no other better pin than this pin. So I take \u2019em from everywhere thathas \u2019em, that gives \u2019em out. And I promote all Napa Valley Winery. Um, so I, I\u2019m practical in that\nutilitarian, like, do something for you. And it was great to see some of the products, like peoplejust, they needed it, you know?Um, I always aspired to the ones that help people look good, make money, all that. And we builtthose into those products for sure, where people could use those things and what labeled themor package them into a bigger thing. And so a lot of the products were very utility products, butthe marketing and things we did was very aspirational.Um, [00:06:00] this one so interesting because you had already been working on something andyou showed it to me and I was like, oh, wow. And. As I can do anything, I can blow somethingreal big up, you know? And that\u2019s what we did. We, wow. The compelling thing was, you know,I\u2019ll take some of the marketing tools, like for instance, uh, the one I just kind of default to think ofis Optum Monster.Hmm. When you see what, whatever time they came out with the Optum Monster, um, whenyou see that a popup and what they, what you could do with that, you instantly kind of go, ohwow, I could do that too. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s really compelling for me. Um mm-hmm. When you\u2019reable to show an outcome that people go, I mean, it\u2019s marketing product for sure.It helps you build your email, um, email list. It helps you potentially, [00:07:00] uh, get somepurchases from coupons and things like that. Not to go into the full thing about Optum Monster,but. You go right there, you can see what the product does. Mm-hmm. And if you don\u2019t havethat, you can go, wow, this could make, make it easier.What\u2019s compelling about what you said was, or what we, we, you showed me is this, one of themany things we talked about was the social images, being able to, you write your post and thenyou\u2019re, you\u2019re ready to promote it and like you said, go to Cam and do all these things. Um, Ithink in this conversation, what I\u2019ve kinda learned from Crop Drive Express and then past stuff isparticularly with this idea, we can give that aha oh wow moment for someone.And we talked about using it on some of our client sites, post status and different things. Um,because then when you see. That\u2019s where I [00:08:00] think, you know, when they seesomething going out that has a nice treatment, um, yeah. Where it\u2019s not just a link. I mean,that\u2019s what I tend to do personally. Um, then I think there\u2019s, there\u2019s some merit there of you wantyour base hub to be your website and they\u2019re promoting outs through your social channels, andthen those to look appealing and good, whether it\u2019s Facebook, Instagram, whatever those thingsare.Yeah. Um, and kinda lead back. And that\u2019s where I go. I\u2019ll tell you, I in this, in this whole projectthat we\u2019ve been working on together, it just keep, I keep coming back to you and I talked aboutour, at our product owners meet up this week. Um, getting as close as you can to the pain that apotential customer has, um, or that desire to do for them to look better, make more money.\nUm, I don\u2019t know. This is the work I need to do more is getting closer to that, you know? Mm-hmm. Where it\u2019s not just theory, us talking, it\u2019s like, [00:09:00] you know, do, is this an issue?\nAnd there\u2019s, um, you know, a book out called the Mom Test and mm-hmm. The thing is, whenyou have an idea and you go to your mom, she\u2019s always gonna say, I love it.Yeah. So making it in a way where it\u2019s more discovery. But that\u2019s my thoughts about this and Iwanna be sure because this is a bigger project. Um, I guess the word would be validating. Yep.Is there a pain point? Is there someone willing to, to, to pay for it? Um, so we\u2019re really taking it. Iknow we approached this as a hobby, but going, okay, give our best effort to make this intosomething that actually does pay us my thought.Corey Maass: Yeah. . And that was, and that was, I think, part of why, so I don\u2019t remember thesummary to, to, we\u2019re on session 10. So in session eight, I think we, we, the conversation cameto a point where we said, okay, so, so [00:10:00] cropping images is one piece of the puzzle ofconsistent, good looking images on a WordPress site.That could be a blog, that could be WooCommerce, whatever, right? Um, and so we were stillsort of solving, um, yeah, we were solving a basic problem. Um, again, a p a a point of pain that,uh, we had. Um, I\u2019m, I\u2019m trying, in my brain, I keep drawing this analogy of, um, a basic car, yourHonda Civic from, I, my first Honda Civic, uh, that I bought in 2015 was from 2000.So 15 year old, you know, but in good shape. But it would get you there, but no bells andwhistles. The, the crank windows, the whole thing, right? And so, um, and, and a lot of people, Ithink this was a, you know, more traditionally [00:11:00] WordPress as a blog platform was thatfor a lot of people, I\u2019m gonna put words out.\nMaybe people find it or they don\u2019t. I\u2019m gonna tell my friends about it along come social media,uh, and, and other paradigms and, and the things go from, I guess you sort of hope for inbound,you know, and we\u2019re talking about amateurs or, or non-professionals is the better word, right?But, um, you know, to outbound.And then also I think there\u2019s an expectation now, or most people blog for money, right? Mostpeople publish for money. Most people use WordPress for money a lot more than back in theday when it was, you know, express yourself or put yourself online or, or, you know, buildauthority, all those things. Um, and so taking that, uh, your, the, the bigger problem that we,when we talked about with crop express of consistent [00:12:00] images and putting yourself outthere, and it\u2019s like we\u2019re talking about, um, Individuality, right?So it\u2019s not just cropping finding a, finding a, a stock photo one for each post, right? Or each, um,product image. If you\u2019ve, if you\u2019re running Woo commerce, it\u2019s like, yeah, it\u2019s a square. Okay, it\u2019s,I sell, you know, this widget and that widget, and I crop them all to be squares. But it\u2019s like, dothose images stand out?Do those images have more information? So it\u2019s like, if I go to the website, there\u2019s all theinformation next to a photo. But on Twitter, if I put that photo up and it\u2019s just a picture of awidget, it doesn\u2019t list the benefits. It doesn\u2019t, you know, so it\u2019s not, um, a compelling bigger, andthis is where, you know, um, I think one of the things that really clicked for me was you sent me.The, on the, on the post status blog, one of the threads there is, or tags or something is, youknow, here are all the [00:13:00] people we\u2019ve featured. And I was like, wait, all of these bannerimages not only are the same size, but they\u2019ve all got the same treatment. They all have thepost status logo on the left. Um, you know, and we look at, and that, and that, that solidifiedsomething for me that you\u2019d touched on, but I, I couldn\u2019t relate to as much.Like, you, you really liked slides, um, and talked about using slides again to promote things.And, and we sort of went, wow, what if, you know, you have, um, uh, your product images, youor your, your, your blog post banner, image featured image, um, that had bullet points on it or,you know, so it was like taking these, I guess what I\u2019m trying to do is summarize, um, veryspecifically, A little bit of how we got here, but also what we\u2019re now talking about, right?So we\u2019re talking about image treatment, image generation, um, based around one post quoteunquote [00:14:00] post, which in WordPress can be a product, can be a blog post, can be anarticle, can be your course if you\u2019re running an l m s, whatever it is. Um, and so that\u2019s kind ofthe, the switch from solving a pain point, cropping an image to this huge value add.And it\u2019s like, and I guess, yeah, uh, it\u2019s, it\u2019s coming together in my head. You brought in opt,brought up Optum Monster. So it\u2019s like you could have a website, you could have great content.Optin Monster is this value add. If your end goal is promotion, money, fame, and fortune, all thatkind of stuff, being a reality TV star, um, optin Monster is this great.You know, the going from, from your Honda Civic to the, the sport version, and then the fins andthe, you know, so now suddenly you\u2019ve got, you know, you\u2019ve gone from a basic way to publishcontent to, you know, bells and [00:15:00] whistles essentially. Um, which isn\u2019t to diminish it likebells and whistles are often it\u2019s, um, not it\u2019s, it\u2019s said in a condescending way or a bad way, butwe\u2019re talking about like, okay, how can you, you know, make the, the basic car that gets youfrom A to B be a fun experience, that kind of thing.Um, enough restraining the metaphors. The point is, um, yeah, OptinMonster adds this extravalue and whatnot. So it\u2019s like if we have, uh, if you write a blog post, what we\u2019re talking aboutdoing is, is. A product in WordPress that can generate slides, can generate images, could cropthe image, but also could add potentially a, a graphical treatment.Um, so it\u2019s always got a blue fade or it\u2019s always got a logo on the left, or it\u2019s always got, and, andthese things would be auto-generated. Um, so you, you finish your post, you click a button and[00:16:00] you\u2019ve got an image for Twitter, an image for Facebook, an image that you know, Imean, taking this to a, um, an extreme no idea if we can yet, if we can do this, but, um, anim ancreating an animated gift that has three slides that go by or, you know, things, so things youcould upload to Instagram.You know, if it\u2019s an animated gif it should be, we could create an MP4 out of it and then it\u2019s, um,a story for Instagram cuz it\u2019s a video and da da da. So all these, all these shareable assets,which again, take that basic blog post and just blow it up to, to create all these amazing thingsthat you could then do something with.\nUm, when we came to, when we were starting to talk about that as a product in our previous callor previous previous call, that was when I said, okay, let\u2019s have a conversation offline cuz I thinkmaybe I\u2019ve got a solution for this. Um, so in [00:17:00] parallel, for a few months now, um, I built.Little SAS app, basically web service, um, called screenshot.express and haven\u2019t launched it.That was if, if you follow me on Twitter, or I think I might have mentioned here too, like this is aproduct that I built, um, and the a p I works, it works as a, is a little screenshotting platform. Um,but what I really wanted it for was, yes, it\u2019s great for taking a screenshot of a website, but if itcan take a picture of, of, of a website.But that website could be the size and shape of a Twitter banner or, you know, could be a, um, aslide. Then we\u2019re now talking about using H T M L to, to define a layout. Whatever we want thatto look like. And then taking pictures of it. And then there you\u2019ve got your image and so, and CRand [00:18:00] generating different types of H T M L pages and also taking advantage of res, theresponsiveness of, of layout.So it\u2019s like if you have a header and some text next to each other, but on mobile, the he, theheader goes above the text with one H T M L output. You take two pictures, one wide and onenarrow. You\u2019ve now got a, uh, a Twitter banner and you know, a mobile screenshot or whatever.So it\u2019s like, I realized that in parallel, I\u2019ve already got this little service that will potentially solvethe technical aspect of this.Um, and so that was where sort of all this came together and we went, wow, that\u2019s, that to me isa much bigger thing. Um, and so as you said at the, the beginning of my ramble, like, we seethis as a, as a much bigger product to me, right away my gut says, okay, that\u2019s much more of a,something we could sell. You know, it\u2019s, [00:19:00] it\u2019s a big packageable thing.Whereas crop Express, it was like, this is a great little utility. It solves a neat little problem. Andwe could probably keep adding some things or, or splashing around in the problem until wefound something that would, people pay, would pay a little bit for. Um, but this to me seems likesomething much bigger.Cory Miller: Yeah, for sure. And I don\u2019t, um, my tendency is always like, oh, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go.And I\u2019m trying to really not do that because I, I wanna be careful, you, you in particular. Me too.But you, um, as a developer on the partner, um, and lead on this, I, I wanna be really carefulwith the time. Mm-hmm. Um, because I, I think we both go, we did something of value here, andI wanna be a little bit more calculated than I have in the past about Okay.Because I can blow these ideas up and go, okay, I see these, what I don\u2019t wanna do is just dothat in a [00:20:00] vacuum. Um, not to like you and I are doing this, but I, I want to, I feel likethere\u2019s something so powerful of getting to whatever the person is trying to do, like havingsomebody in mind, or talking to people and seeing what they.Talk about it\u2019s, it\u2019s funny. So with product at post status, I go, just to give you kind of a parallelabout how I\u2019ve historically think about product and need to change and, and evolve, is I go,okay, for our agency, we, we saw real quickly becoming an owner post status that, um, okay,product people, smaller group of people than you got hosting companies, you haveprofessionals that do all the work.But I really honed in on, there\u2019s a lot of WordPress agencies out there, and I don\u2019t see in thisspace a lot of people that there are really cool companies doing really high-end work foragencies like [00:21:00] Troy, Dean\u2019s work, um, uro, different things like that. But I go, okay, I,for me, Passion and ability and go.I\u2019d love to promote and help people tell stories and draw expertise. So long story short, besidesjust Slack and e and our email newsletter, I think we can offer more to them. Where I\u2019m at in thatproduct is really interesting for me. Frustrating. I shouldn\u2019t say interesting. I don\u2019t wanna sayinteresting.It\u2019s frustrating as hell is I go, we could do mar co-marketing for these agencies. Now you knowhow it is, you bring in an idea to somebody else. It\u2019s so different from the my uh, the, my big FatGreek wedding when he goes, you have to make it his idea. And I go, oh, that\u2019s so true with metoo. But, but I go, if you get to customer and see what they\u2019re doing, um, potential customer andjust talk.So like in my interviews with the agency owners, one of the things they stand up, but I[00:22:00] think there\u2019s a bias cause I\u2019m coming at as post status. Um, and one of the featureswe\u2019ve had in our products is job listings. I go. That\u2019s what they tend to have gravitated toward it.\nAnd I go, well, I don\u2019t know what more else we could potentially offer in that, but keep gettingpros in there.And so that\u2019s like existing product, just trying to make it better, which is valid foundational. Iwanted to do more for them. Now this is where we\u2019re in that process and, but I don\u2019t want it tobe like, I got this cool idea. Cuz then you\u2019re kind of just striking trying to try to hit a hit, a hit awinning lado.Um, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m at, you know? And, um, with this my mind went to, oh, I mean we, wewere talking about our own problems right now, and then we\u2019re using some clients and differentthings to think about that. But before we go, I wanna make sure [00:23:00] specifically first andforemost on your behalf is we. Gets some validation.A little spark of something. Yeah. And collect enough sparks that go, this could be a fire. Right?This could be, I just, I wanna do that cuz my tendency is I\u2019m an DF fair and you know, I dr at theopportunity to work with a great developer like yourself and, and product person like yourself.And, uh, so anyway, that\u2019s where my mind tends to go.But this is interesting to both of us. Um, now it\u2019s like if you got a hammer, everything looks like,like a nail. Uh, I wanna be careful of that in this.Corey Maass: Yeah, sure. And I tend to build first and ask questions later. We know this, so,which isCory Miller: freaking cool. I think that\u2019s better. See, it would be better as an idea person to beable to build it first too.Right. And say, but I just, I wanna be careful cause I don\u2019t have those skillsets.\nCorey Maass: Well, and, and this one is, I think one of the other things I mentioned in the pre-roll is [00:24:00] this is a much bigger lift. Yeah. And so I\u2019m also, my brain is saying there\u2019s, there\nare red flags here to that approach. Crop express, small, you know, crank something out, get it,you know, we, the prototype is going to be straightforward, uh, or was straightforward and, andyou coming in and going start with featured images.Great. Even simpler. So we\u2019ve got one and it turned out to be replicable. So then media library,um, block, um, we did have to hire somebody to get us over a couple of hurdles, but for themost part, Replicable, um, reusable code and all at once. Whereas this, I mean, so I alreadystarted my intention of spinning up screenshot express, which is abstract.And I knew that. I\u2019m like, this is probably isn\u2019t a thing. I\u2019m gonna, [00:25:00] I\u2019m, I\u2019m gonna sellon its own. There are, and there are people who are making progress with, with other productsthat take screenshots. And I admire that because I\u2019m like, this is a, this is a service. This is a,this a hundred percent a solution looking for a problem.And so it\u2019ll be other developers or me as a developer that uses this tool for whatever problem.And so it\u2019s like the, I said about building a, a WordPress plugin, which I think you and I shouldreview and start pulling apart and see what we can do with, um, But it\u2019s, uh, to generate socialimages to accompany a post.Um, and so the good news is, yeah, I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve solved some of the, like, some of the problems,like, what do I wanna say, as a product, it\u2019s more complicated and involving a third party service,like screenshot.express is more complicated. And [00:26:00] then setting up different images fordifferent use cases is complicated.And, uh, and solving the right problems is complicated. It\u2019s like you go to Canva, they\u2019ve got like,not only do they have all the assets and stuff, but they\u2019ve got a gajillion templates. What do youwanna make today? I wanna make an Instagram post. I wanna make a, you know, a musicvideo. I wanna make a dot, dot dot.Like all these things. So somebody had to sit down and, and make templates out of all thosethings. Um, and so it\u2019s building, this is going, you know, as already. Even though I\u2019ve solvedsome of the problems connecting to the p i of Screenshot express and stuff is like, all of that ismore complicated, a much more complicated user experience.Um, before we even get to the fun part of like, okay, now we can just build a gajillion templatesand hope that one of them is the right thing and, and, and on and on. So, um, so yeah, it, itstrikes me that you doing more interviews, re more research, [00:27:00] um, us getting moreanswers, um, before I, like, I\u2019m, I\u2019m inclined to, I keep waiting for you to say, like you saying,featured image early on was such a pivotal point, like, here\u2019s how we simplify this big,complicated thing to start with.\nUm, so no pressure, but I\u2019m waiting for you to come up with that again. Um, but I do think thatsince I\u2019ve got, since I\u2019m close to having s a, an initial. Social image generator plugin forwardWordPress using Screenshot express that maybe we start there cuz it does solve the problem.Um, enough for us to, for, for you to get eyes on it as far as user experience and go, yeah, no,this is, you\u2019ve made it as you, Corey have made it as simple as possible.It\u2019s good enough. You know, we can, we can [00:28:00] tolerate people, people will toleratestepping through this pro progress process, even though it\u2019s a handful of steps to get the valuethat we are creating at the end. Um, and then, and we keep having these conversations like wedid with Crop Express, where we go, okay, wait, but if we put this over here, it makes moresense in context.Or if we mm-hmm. You know, connected to a different service or we put it in front of certainkinds of people, um, then. It\u2019ll take us, it\u2019ll take us to it. It\u2019ll help us grow.Cory Miller: Yeah. Uh, I just asked ChatGPT what are the most popular features of Canva?Hmm. So that, that\u2019s interesting. Um, excuse me, because we\u2019ve mentioned that a number oftimes and different photo editing tool.Um, I think so two parts, making sure I really understand what Screenshotted Express can do atthe moment. Um, [00:29:00] but two, I think in this next experiment is having, having a defaultcustomer in mind. Yeah. And, you know, sizing that market, the, the person that we know, thatwe think we understand or have some connections with.And then seeing how that market is. Because it cur, it occurs to me like I told you with backupbuddy. I go, well, that\u2019s a hundred percent. Theoretically, theoretically, everyone should want a,a backup for their WordPress site, right? Um, that was easy, right? Because the, you know,we\u2019re gonna go into this field and we\u2019re gonna hit something.Um,Corey Maass: But to, but I think to your point, like your average non nerd or non-professionaldoesn\u2019t think about that. You know, there\u2019s a reason why they are automatically that mosthosting companies [00:30:00] offer automatic backups. And even if they don\u2019t, I almost canguarantee that they\u2019re doing at least some periodic, because the majority of their support ticketsare, I broke my site, or somebody hacked my site.What? And I, you know, and, and support. A technician comes back and says, great, whatabout, what do you have for backups? And the person goes, what\u2019s a backup? And then theygo, oh, well you are lucky on our server in a very hidden technical way. I can at least restore itfrom seven days ago or from yesterday or what have you.You know, but you should have thought about this and then mm-hmm. You know, but, but youraverage person doesn\u2019t think about backups. Right. Um, so you still, you were solving a problemthat everybody has, but most people don\u2019t know they have. Mm-hmm.Cory Miller: Yeah. And, and where when we get the main product out, we\u2019re able to do[00:31:00] content marketing around all the reasons why it would be good.We even created a content, um, content replacement calendar or something. We tried to say,what\u2019s the value of all your posts? Because I lost, uh, I lost things from my personal websitewhen we had a server crash. Now, you know, there they weren\u2019t invaluable, but it was, it was aheadache. So we started doing that to try to map that out.But, um, when we talk about avatars for a second, um, we have your clients content journey,and then the, what I hear over, and it\u2019s so interesting, my, my own perception of WordPress haschanged so much. Um, but what I hear over and over from our agencies and owners and thingsis that the people running when they deliver projects, I, it\u2019s really compelling that it\u2019s marketing[00:32:00] specific people.Mm-hmm. I just got outta the, a agency owners meetup and it was again, like they\u2019re turningsites over and typically it\u2019s marketing related type. People are actually the people using theirWordPress sites from enterprise. WordPress does really good in the enterprise becausemarketers go, it\u2019s cheaper, it\u2019s faster, and I can use it.So I, I would say like in this backup buddy thought, I go big market, I am a marketer. I go that,that\u2019s really compelling. Which is why when we talked about screenshotted express, I was likethe social images. I, but I don\u2019t, I gotta admit, make sure I\u2019m honest about this. I don\u2019t do that. Idon\u2019t really post to our website.Um, we have team and content journey and different things that do that. But if we take that a,that\u2019s one big avatar. I can like say, generally speaking, [00:33:00] if we hit the marketing room\nand that\u2019s the, the sexy make you look better, make money kind of realm. Yeah. So there\u2019s one,um, I think about yours as a lot of publishers, um, uh, publishers.But even like a lot of the content journey, you know, clients, um, it\u2019s, it kind of boils down to themarketing people. They\u2019re the ones interfacing with those clients. Yeah. Very.Corey Maass: Yep. Um, yeah, we\u2019ve got, I\u2019ve got a couple of different scenarios. One is on oneteam, we have a person dedicated to social media. Um, and I am, so, so there\u2019s an interview Iwant to have, um, customer interview, like talk to them about how they\u2019re making stuff.I think they\u2019re using Canva. Um, and I think that they\u2019ve got template set up so that, again, it\u2019s,they plug in a featured [00:34:00] image, they plug in a featured image, but it\u2019s got the sametreatment every time. Um, I want to make sure of. And I\u2019d love, we\u2019ll have you talk to them if, ifyou\u2019re following the, um, mom interview methodology.Um, cuz I\u2019d also, I think what would be really interesting would be, I have a history of taking, uh,blue ocean products and, and rebuilding them, repurposing them for WordPress. Um,sometimes with legit value and sometimes just because it\u2019s a smaller market, so it\u2019s easier tofocus. And, and I\u2019m still fascinated with the idea of WordPress being the control panel for a, aperson\u2019s entire business.Um, but I also would be curious if, you know, sorry. Um, if the people are who, if they arejumping into Canva, are they struggling? Like, is it too many choices? [00:35:00] Is it, um,repeatable? Uh, sorry, I gotta let a dog in. Hold on.Cory Miller: Go, go for it. I, I\u2019m opening up a y board to take some notes.Corey Maass: And thankfully my spouse stepped in and cornered him. Um, but yeah, it\u2019s, youknow, so is, is there value in generating these things from WordPress with the expectation that,like I just wrote, wrote a blog post, and as we talked about before, you know, there\u2019s the, the last10% or the, you know, maybe it\u2019s, let\u2019s use 80 20, right?Like 80% of what should be the process is writing a blog post. But at least in our experience,80% of the pain is. Um, the technically speaking anyway is going and finding an image,cropping [00:36:00] an image, all that kind of stuff, which is what we were trying to solve withCrop Express. And so, um, you know, is it, is it parallel here where it\u2019s like, okay, I\u2019ve written ablog post now what?And I think that that\u2019s a big problem, uh, to solve. Uh, or it\u2019s a, a question that, that we wanna becareful. We want to do a good job of defining the question to then come up with the solution.Um, and so it\u2019s, you know, our people. If, if, if we can get to the point where you\u2019ve generated ablog post, click a button, and then you\u2019ve got assets, that\u2019s amazing.Um, is that enough? How hard or difficult is it to create those assets? Because it\u2019s like Canvaoffers creativity. Right. You can do anything all the time forever. But I, for me, um, like I have amusic blog, and so every time I, [00:37:00] or one of my writers writes a review, I go into Canvaand I open exa, I open the same design, I say duplicate page.I change the title. I change the, so that it has the same treatment, right? Like, I\u2019m not doing whatCanva kind of seems to want you to do, which is starting from scratch every single time.Because I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not doing that. I\u2019m not trying to be that creative, and in fact, that takes waymore time rather than, You know, a quick, simple 32nd, copy, paste, change, title, publish.Um, and so I\u2019m, I\u2019m intrigued to find out if I\u2019m right about that. Um, mm-hmm. You know, if, if ourteam, if my teammate, somebody writes a story, publishes a story, like we have professionalwriters who are writing, um, you know, long form content, and then we\u2019ve got, again, a separate[00:38:00] person whose job it is in part to create social media content from that story to thenpublish everywhere.Um, and I\u2019d be interested to know if it\u2019s a simple process for them or, uh, the hypothesis similarto the crop express hypothesis is are they going, you know, the hard part should be. Putting allthis stuff out there, looking at the analytics, like creating a, essentially a, a mini campaign, um, topromote this blog post.But most of the pain is actually going in and, and cropping an image and adding the treatmentand all that kind of stuff. Um, and if, and if there\u2019s value in having that sit in WordPressalongside the blog post, um, you know, whether it\u2019s under media or whether it\u2019s going into thepost and then seeing a little icon that opens up an app or, you know, whatever approach it is,um, you know, to make sure that there\u2019s as much benefit there as we\u2019re [00:39:00] hoping.Cory Miller: Okay. I\u2019m trying to make sure I take all these,\num, okay. So, um, potential avatars, I think we\u2019ve said marketing. I try to put a little bit. Thinghere. We got publishers I added in here. Um, because one thing that kind of, if you, if I justcamp out in this marketing realm, um, I thought about screenshot express, and I go ebookcreation or lead magnet creation.Mm-hmm. Like the covers. Mm-hmm. Um, you know, some kind of cover. Now I think that wouldalso lend to this featured image creation in the sense of those graphics you talked about withpost status. Like we got the featured image graphic that we kind of pulled together, but it justkind of made me [00:40:00] think like outputs, maybe I should put that here.Uh, outputs,um, social images, we said this, uh, featured images, uh, oh e let me just say ebook coverage,just in the realm of possibility here. Yep.Corey Maass: Slides was the thing that got you your gears turning early on.Cory Miller: I was thinking of tip boxes. Lemme see if I can share my screen. Nope. I have toclose the Y board. I was on, uh, CAO\u2019s website looking at their di i y lighting kit and they had apullout with a tip. Oh, okay. So I, I don\u2019t know how to call, like pull out, pull out boxes and Iguess that could be quotesthey call to action. Hmm. Um, like, [00:41:00] well, let\u2019s put ads, ads into Oh yeah. Post etcetera. Wow. Yeah.Corey Maass: Wow. Wow. Ads like auto ad gener, ad ad image generator from a Woocommerce product. Mm. Holy crap.Cory Miller: That could be coupons, like mm-hmm. I, I was even thinking your HTML side, cuzyou\u2019re generating H M L and then you\u2019re taking the snapshot of it.But like, you know, Kohl\u2019s or Bed Bath and Beyond, you know, they have a coupon and it lookslike a little coupon thing. And I mean, if there\u2019s HTML, if we\u2019re generating HTML, don\u2019t even, youdon\u2019t have to go to the screenshot if you don\u2019t want to, but like, you could put that with a littledressing that kind of calls it out, so.Yep. Um,[00:42:00]okay, let me, let\u2019s do this for a second. Let\u2019s take this marketing because I think we, there\u2019s thebig market, bigger market there. It\u2019s a lot of the users. When I think about creating a blog post,I\u2019m thinking about organic search traffic primarily. Um, But so that it gets placed in the searchengine, uh, it gets ranked and then traffic comes to that page.When they get on page, then I want them to do something. This is where, you know, Optummonitor or popup thing is like compelling because it\u2019s, you get attention, like offer free offerinside, right?Corey Maass: Kind of thing. Yeah. It turns, it turns passive into, uh, there\u2019s ac there\u2019ssomething\u2019s actionable. Yeah. So it\u2019s not, don\u2019t just consume, like, and so this is where you\u2019vegot, uh, share these, bookmark these, you know, it\u2019s like, so I\u2019m reading somebody\u2019s article andyet I get a popup that says, [00:43:00] want more great content like this?Sign up. Want an ebook of related content? Sign up. Um, here, share buttons. Please share thison, you know, if you got value out of this, share this on Twitter. Um, email it to a friend. Um, butthinking in terms of, yeah, images, um, so, you know, if we\u2019re just talking content, written words,then, um, my, the featured image that you\u2019d see ideally would be stylized, something that fits inwith your site.But if you ask a guest to share this story on Twitter, big pretty image is obviously morecompelling than just a, a headline. Um, but you don\u2019t want to share the featured image becausethe featured image probably doesn\u2019t have, uh, the title of the post. Uh, it might or might not, butit certainly, what I, what I thought you, a brilliant idea you came up with was, [00:44:00] youknow, a featured image with a, or, or a shareable image, which is the featured includes thefeatured image, the title of the post, and then one or two.It could be the excerpt, it could be one or two bullet points, but, so it\u2019s like if I go to share, if Iread an article, You know, and it has a pretty image of a, some sunset and it says, best placesto retirement, retire to, okay. But if I\u2019m sharing an image on Twitter, the image that I share shouldsay the best places to retire to should have the sunset in the background.And then, you know, a, a tag, an excerpt that says the results will blow you away. Total click bait.Or, you know, the top, you know, should say the top five, Hawaii, Alaska, blah, blah, blah. Youknow, click to read the rest of \u2019em, kind of thing. So then it\u2019s, it\u2019s, um, you know, and that\u2019sdifferent from the featured image and that\u2019s different from, that\u2019s the type of thing you\u2019d run over\nto Canva and, and generate and, and maybe [00:45:00] generate in a number of different sizesand shapes to then push, you know, drag into buffer or whatever you use to schedule yoursocials or to broadcast your socials.I definitely wanna make sure we don\u2019t get into that realm. Um, Because interacting with all thoseAPIs is a nightmare, and there\u2019s a hundred of those tools already. But, um, oh, and, um, Yost, shuh, the OG image, uh, is the other one. So again, if an image that\u2019s different from you\u2019ve gotyour featured image, you go and you, you pa paste the URL into Twitter or into Slack, and youget that little preview card, that\u2019s your open graph image.Twitter now has Twitter cards, which is their version. And so again, having different, differentversions generated for all of these things. And some of this I think we can do even behind thescenes, which I think will be really, really neat. And then some of this I think could be, and thenit\u2019s like, [00:46:00] so maybe that\u2019s where, you know, we\u2019re, we\u2019re, we haven\u2019t yet talked about.I mean, we\u2019re not, we\u2019re not ready yet to talk about business models and that kind of thing, buthypothetically, a. Beginner version that just does a couple of the basic things. Here\u2019s ashareable image. Um, or here\u2019s the, the open graph image for every post, every productautomatically generated, done. Um, and that\u2019s not necessar.That\u2019s maybe something that people can set and forget kind of thing. But then we\u2019re also talkingabout, in my mind at least, we\u2019re talking about something that approaches more of a Canva kindof functionality for marketers. So it\u2019s like, yes, the, the basics are covered, the incoming stuff iscovered, or the quick share, uh, in Slack preview is covered.Um, but then talking about, you know, saying, okay, now I need the list of assets that I\u2019ve[00:47:00] predefined, I wanna slide for, um, you know, for social medias. Cuz it\u2019s like, and ifyou. If you\u2019re doing it right, air quotes, right? You are not posting about a, a blog post once youare not, uh, putting an image into or putting a product into woo commerce, tweeting about itonce and then hoping that it sells a gajillion, you are again, creating a campaign that says, okay,you know, over the next six months, tweet about this every couple of days, every then, everyfew days in it, every once a week.And you sort of, you might peter off, but there\u2019s this arc and you want those images to bepotentially to be different every time. And so it\u2019s like, could you generate a bunch of images thatthen get cued, um, you know, on all different platforms. And so it\u2019s like potentially you\u2019re talkingabout, um, oh, I think the other neat thing that you mentioned in a previous conversation waslike, Answer a few questions, [00:48:00] right?So it\u2019s like word w WordPress is already gonna ask you for an excerpt fine. But it\u2019s like, what arethree bullet points? What are two or three quotes? And then if it auto-generated a whole bunchof images that had the quotes, that had the, um, oh, you know what, uh, uh, what\u2019s analogous?Like there\u2019s, um, what\u2019s it called?Um, I have a book marked, um, avatar Image. Photo.Cory Miller: Oh, yeah. Avatars.Corey Maass: So there\u2019s, um, yeah. Avatars. And so basically kind of creating little avatarimages for, um,Cory Miller: I mean, profile cards, you know, like, right.Corey Maass: So yeah. So p fp maker.com. P fp maker mm-hmm. Profile pick maker. Is whatit\u2019s short for, right? But you upload a photo of yourself, it, it [00:49:00] strips the background out,and then it, and then it just delivers you a page full of avatars.So it\u2019s your photo over and over again, but all these different funky backgrounds. And so youscroll through them and you\u2019re like, Ooh, I like that one. I like that one. I like that one. Um, Ithink, yeah, go to my Twitter account and you\u2019ll see one, and I use this to just like, I go, I uploadthis to, we\u2019ve looked at the, um, sticker mule background remover kind of thing.Um, and I think there\u2019s, remove.bg was one that I just found recently. That\u2019s a great r l. But soit\u2019s like you create an image, you take an image of yourself, you use a tool to strip thebackground, and then you upload it here. And now you\u2019ve got, you know, a dozen or two orthree dozen different backgrounds and they\u2019ve got ones with palm trees and the Eiffel Tower,which is fun, right?But so picturing like, You know, you write a blog post, you create a new Woo commerce product,you go, you, you hit publish. And, and then, you know, our plugin essentially says, okay,[00:50:00] you\u2019re ready to create marketing assets. Um, what do you want to create today?\nTwitter, Instagram, you know, and then, great, what\u2019s, what\u2019s the headline, which we can auto,auto pull.Um, what\u2019s the excerpt? We, again, we can auto pull, um, featured image to start with, right?But maybe you wanna upload other ones. Um, what are three bullet points? What are some pullquotes? What are some benefi, you know, we can sort of customize a questionnaire that says,fill these in, generate. And then now you\u2019ve got essentially a matrix that\u2019s like, you know, animage for Twitter, an image for Facebook, an image for do, do, do, do.And going across. You\u2019ve got quote, quote, Bullet point, bullet point, bullet point, style, style,style, um, you know, light mode, dark mode, play with fonts kind of thing. Um mm-hmm. Youknow, and it, and so you suddenly, you\u2019ve got a catalog of generated relevant images designedto go on a bunch of different platforms and you\u2019d [00:51:00] go, okay, yep, this one works.This one works, this one\u2019s silly. Ignore it, you know, whatever. Um, butCory Miller: so in, yeah, so in this, um, I went to the ChatGPT my researcher Yep. And, um,image SEO came out and I was like, okay, if I\u2019m embodying, um, I\u2019m trying to do this, I\u2019mpublishing site content in order to get ranked in Google. And you get on here, if you\u2019ve done allthe work to do an SEO o keyword blog post, you\u2019re using WordPress.Great platform to do that. You go what was be one extra while you\u2019re already there to get a littlebit extra stuff. Mm-hmm. And this Image SEO thing popped up in the list that I asked. Mm-hmm.And it\u2019s kind of compelling. Um,and I read something just a second ago, uh, and I checked out your profile maker too. That\u2019ssuper cool. [00:52:00] Um, half of all Google searches end on the searcher. So wait, I\u2019m sorry. Ithought I was saying how, how big SEO image SEO is, but we\u2019re kind of saying that with thesocial images too, is you\u2019ve got this thing, there\u2019s ways you can distribute your content in a wayout to the different platforms.But I go Google too. Like I image should be, if we land on this should be a part of thisconversation. Mm-hmm. Because then you\u2019re going, okay, ex. I mean, what if you could takeyour blog posts, they get all this traffic and increase it by 10%? That\u2019s a headline. Wow. Or the,the product. So, you know, well, like you talked about e-commerce, um, what if there\u2019s a way togenerate, easily an image that could be feature post featured image post or [00:53:00]something in, in the thing.But it also gets some SEO ranking when they\u2019re going, and I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t do this myself, but,um, I don\u2019t look for images in Google necessarily, but it just compelling to kind explore that. Doyou? Okay. Yeah.Corey Maass: Like we talked about, I think, I think it would be really interesting to know, like, I, Imake the assumption that Google looks at images more than alt tag, title tag.Like, I think we\u2019re to the point. I, I, I.Safe assumption, I don\u2019t know. Um, but I assume that Google can, if they look at a blog post,they look at the image, they read the alag, but then they actually parse the image and say, yes,this is in fact an image of a sunset when we\u2019re talking about places to vacation. I don\u2019t know ifthat\u2019s true. I\u2019d love to find out if that\u2019s [00:54:00] true.But it\u2019s like, so if you have an image that has words on it, I mean, at this point when I open animage with words on it in, you know, Mac preview or Microsoft Paint, the words are editable. Sothe, uh, algorithm for parsing text in an image is so commonplace now that it\u2019s built into the, thefree image editor on, on Mac Os.So I have to assume that it\u2019s that pervasive everywhere. So, Um, you know, so is there a, anSEO benefit to having words in an image that then gets shared? Um mm-hmm. Or no?Cory Miller: Well, I mean, I would go, if you\u2019re gonna post an image, you know, your tourism,your e-commerce shop, you\u2019re, why not? You\u2019ve already got the images there.Yeah. Um, you should be doing some image sto. I mean, that\u2019s just easy, you know, a little bitmore effort and you\u2019re able to, [00:55:00] I don\u2019t know, cast a net water, but I go, if you\u2019re gonnapost, uh, I don\u2019t know, air compressors in somebody\u2019s trying to find, you know, whatever thereason they might be looking for that.But you post a picture of the image compressor, that\u2019s one thing. But I\u2019ve seen more images toocome up where it\u2019s like, put a little bit of text on there or it branded, you know, or I don\u2019t know. Ilike that mindset of going, how do we help them get a little bit more. Um, reach from somethingthey\u2019re probably already doing.\nCorey Maass: Um, right. I googled how to do image seo and one of the results that came up,so the first sponsored post, uh, is the, the image next to it is dude on laptop. The, the imageadds nothing to the headline, how to optimize images for websites. And [00:56:00] there\u2019s apicture of a dude with a, with a laptop, no value, no context, like if that image came outtacontext, there\u2019s nothing there.Scroll down, um, to another one. 10 steps to optimize images for seo, and next to it is a cardthat has. People, you know, a little graphic of people. Awesome. But it\u2019s in, in text, even thoughthe image is this big in text that almost fills the card. It has the same headline, 10 steps tooptimize images for seo.And there\u2019s a little logo of the website that it\u2019s on, and if I click on it and it gets bigger, there\u2019s thesubtitle that\u2019s like, you know, who\u2019s who. It\u2019s by when it was posted. Um, you know, and it\u2019s likeright there. That\u2019s the image that we\u2019re talking, we\u2019re talking about generating, but somebodyhad to go in and create that card.Well, so I figure if, if, if the, if the third result for searching for Google for [00:57:00] Image SEOis an article about optimizing images for seo, and they include an image that has words on it.You know, and, and like, I mean, we we\u2019re talking about Google, you know, the, the automation,the bots, the algorithms, the, you know, the ai, whatever. But I mean, the obvious benefit is ofjust human stuff is obvious. Like putting something on Twitter, an image that has words ratherthan an image of just a dude on a laptop.Yeah. Obvi, you know, obvious value, but, well, but we do, I thought about Pinterest.Cory Miller: Mm-hmm. Yep. Oh yeah. It\u2019s, I forget about it all the time, but I mean, there\u2019s somany that go, like, it\u2019s a pin and you\u2019re looking for stuff and mm-hmm. You know, taking, it\u2019s away to get a tra traffic back to your post about it.Well put enough detail that entices them to come over. Yep. Um, okay. I wanna get back to[00:58:00] this. Okay. I\u2019m, I\u2019m doing a post and, and may, maybe there\u2019s others, but I think aboutjust. I spent my career with the organic SEO content, um, and I get somebody to the site, andthat\u2019s the first part of the big, the whole process, just getting someone to the site.Um, it talked about like popups help you, you know, do that. Mm-hmm. There\u2019s inbound content,like now that we have patterns within Gutenberg, code editor, block editor, like insertingsomething called a action within that. Um, my traditional has been get \u2019em on the site and givethem some offer that fills irresistible discount, ebook, lead magnet, you know, opt into thenewsletter thing.Corey Maass: Yep.[00:59:00]And I\u2019m, and I, what I\u2019m thinking is, Sim similar to our previous conversations. You know, it\u2019sgonna take a handful of conversations to continue to unearth all of these possibilities, right?This list, which already is 10 points long, is gonna be a lot longer. And so I want someconfirmation, like there\u2019s, there\u2019s an, to me, there\u2019s an obvious benefit of like what I justdescribed.I\u2019m seeing a card, a text on it that somebody had to generate. Do we, can we confirm that youraverage team of one a person who\u2019s blogging, um, recipe, ooh, recipe cards, um, do they.[01:00:00] More of these images generated and or are they already trying to generate theseimages? Are they, you know, is, is the average, um, person, you know, a team of one or two,um, who\u2019s got a, a YouTube vlog or a recipe blog or whatever.Are they posting their article with the recipe? And then what are the next steps they take? Like,that\u2019s the broad question. Do they then go generate images to then put on socials and how dothey schedule, you know, all that stuff? What are the images that they actually care about? Um,to me the, the gut assumption is there are enough people doing something as a next step.And so I\u2019m inclined to. Um, again, get to a point where I\u2019ve essentially solved a problem forgenerating something. And to me, I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I have no problem solving this for me [01:01:00] andyou to start with. Mm-hmm. Um, where I\u2019m generating my images from my music blog, I\u2019mgenerating a couple of basic templates for Instagram, whatever, me as a musician to promote.Um, again, I\u2019m looking at my clients like, what do they need? So a basic Twitter image with aheadline that has a logo on it. Um, and then for you, the post status, um, banners make, how dowe make them all look the same? So again, a logo and, you know, if, if these are all, um, I thinkwhat we looked at, right? Were profiles of people.So it\u2019s upload a picture of the person, post status logo on the left, maybe their name and, um,you know, and, and something from the, you know, and, and then. And then it\u2019s, it\u2019s, to me, it\u2019s,\nit\u2019s up to, again, we\u2019re looking for feedback and or you doing some interviews to find out like,yes, everybody, everybody wants Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, [01:02:00] LinkedIn, like theobvious socials.Um, or yes, people desperately wish that there were slides. Like, I love your interest in slides,but you\u2019re the only person I\u2019ve ever heard of that says that. Um, which doesn\u2019t dismiss it. It justmeans like, that\u2019s not the circle I\u2019m in, right? So, um, yeah, that\u2019s, to me, that\u2019s not something wewant to generate first, but go find me 10 people that are gonna find that interesting.Or if I get you to a point where you can sit down and generate pro templates yourself, you\u2019ll belike, cool, let me go build a slide one, because that\u2019s what I want. And then, and then cuz it\u2019s likeonce, it\u2019s kind of like Canva, like, you know, that they have somebody on staff whose job it is tojust crank out templates mm-hmm.To solve all these little problems. Oh, whoops. We don\u2019t have one for podcasts. Great. 3000 by\n\nGo, go generate that. Oh, there you go. Podcast. Um, yeah. Add that to your list. Um, orwe don\u2019t, you know, [01:03:00] people are posting record their, their new album on, onBandcamp. What, how do you know an image generator for Bandcamp that I\u2019m talking aboutback to Canva?It\u2019s like they, because they\u2019re going, they\u2019re going inch deep, mile wide, you know. Yeah. Sothey, they want one of everything, but there\u2019s, you know, and for them, there\u2019s s e o value, like,you know, there\u2019s a landing page for every single template they have. Because that wayanybody who\u2019s googling for anything, you know, album cover template, they\u2019re, they\u2019re hoping topop up.Mm-hmm. We\u2019ll get there once we have the delivery system for templates, essentially. Um, andI\u2019m not saying we necessarily want to, like, we don\u2019t wanna start there, like let\u2019s find some clearanswers of, of what templates to build first, what, what problems to solve first.Cory Miller: I, I\u2019m still, uh, still so compelled by the slide content and I put in the crazy ideascolumn Here is, uh, LinkedIn [01:04:00] slide content.So the AJ told me about, find this link for you. Um, this service, it\u2019s like a LinkedIn. You\u2019ve seenthis on Instagram too. Um, I\u2019ll find it. It\u2019s a LinkedIn image carousel creator. You put your tweet inand it\u2019ll give you the, the slide content. Oh, Uhhuh. You know, when I tested that on LinkedInseveral years ago, my slide content got way more views than anything else I was doing.And, uh, so I think even like for LinkedIn, um, you think about it, it\u2019s like busy professionals usedto a common language of slides. Yep. Uh, and then being able to quickly get the informationwithout having to go through 1500 words. Yep. It\u2019s still compelling to me.Corey Maass: Um, well, and, and a, a neat coincidence, right?I was like everybody else, I\u2019m looking at, um, Twitter threads [01:05:00] about chat g p tprompts. Um, or you know, what, what are 10 neat things that have happened in the 48 hourssince they released ChatGPT four, um, you know, people have generated re had it generate aworking version of pong, uh, in 60 seconds. I\u2019d mean ridiculous things.But one of the things that I saw was that I, that I was like, oh, this is actually relevant to theworld. Um, other than recreating pong, um, Is somebody dumped in an article and said, make,make 10 slides. And it did. And I, yeah, they\u2019re not styled or anything, but it\u2019s just, here are thebullet points that you\u2019d wanna put on each.So it\u2019s like, uh, you know, have this talk to AI that then gen, you know, write a blog post, click abutton, chat, g p t or some other AI generates the slide content. We generate the slide images.Yeah. Yeah. Holy crap.Cory Miller: Yeah. On that [01:06:00] link too for you.Corey Maass: Um, okay, so we\u2019re over an hour. Where do we go? What\u2019s next? How do westart?What do you wanna do? What are you gonna do today? Um, what do you want me to do? Whoare we gonna talk to? How are we gonna get clients? I think,Cory Miller: I think, um, one area to explore is, um, talking to content journey. Seeing the outputof what they\u2019re doing, asking about the problems and challenges they have in that process fortheir clients.Um, I just forgot, I think there\u2019s an opportunity here to potentially innovate in this of here\u2019s howthis is going, here\u2019s how people do, what is the way to help you stand out? Hmm. So thestandout, and that\u2019s why I say innovate, not just helping cure the workflow issue, but I think[01:07:00] one thing I wanna really explore this time is can we innovate with something?\n\nThat\u2019s where I think the slide content, you know, whether it\u2019s a valid thing or not, is in that realmof they\u2019re doing something. What\u2019s way, one way that could help that content stand out evenmore. It, it includes social images, it includes STO image, SEO and stuff like that. Um, I waslike, Lindsay has a mental health treatment center client.And, and that\u2019s probably one of their best case studies because they took a, aside from, youknow, rarely getting any content to, uh, tenant, I mean considerable. And it drove a lot ofbusiness for \u2019em. And, uh, you think about it, like I, I, I remember talking to him cuz I did someconsulting with them, with the client and they\u2019re trying to find images.That\u2019s another issue we\u2019ve talked about, but it\u2019s out, that\u2019s out there. It\u2019s for somebody else\u2019ssaw potentially. But you go, if they\u2019re doing the image, what\u2019s something that could help thatstand out? And it\u2019s maybe a pull quote. [01:08:00] Mm-hmm. You know, from it or something likethat. That\u2019s where I want to dig in is, um, I\u2019ll talk to Emily over there.Um, And, uh, ask some of that. They\u2019ve got another service called my marketing assistant too.And I\u2019ll ask, what are some of the anonymized, um, client requests they get? Yeah, sure. Theydo have a podcaster in their beta program. Um, prolific podcaster who uses a lot of thedistributed media. Um, like I think he probably uses his website as the base, but, um, a lot of therequests he\u2019s getting is, you know, create the thumbnails for those things that they do, use thosetools that we talked about.But, uh, I think one thing that might give us an edge on this is just like creating a new standardwhere everybody\u2019s going like, whoa, whoa, how\u2019d they do that? I want that too. Like I was tellingyou about the Casto little tip box and stuff. [01:09:00] Um, so that\u2019s what I would like to explorein this and then just understand their process a little bit better.And what would be something that doesn\u2019t take a lot of time. But then enhances uh, the contentand makes it stand out a little bit more. And I mean, it could be that whole call to action thing,you know? Um, like a, being able to stylize some, you know, for the treatment center it\u2019s call us.Cuz if they call, if someone calls the treatment center, they can really help them and understandwhat the right fit is and all that kinda stuff.So their call to action is, you know, I think it still is the case, but if they get a phone call, that\u2019sgreat. That\u2019s where they want to be. And then that turns over their sales operation. I\u2019m trying tothink of another client. Um, there\u2019s a lot of b2b, so, um, B2B there too. That seems like[01:10:00] another area where maybe big companies have innovated with the B2B space.Let me put that in here cause I don\u2019t want to drop this. Like, I have a friend that has amanufacturing company. He does the air condit, the cooling compressor stuff. He remanufacturethem. And, uh, I mean, there\u2019s a space with people with money, um, and it\u2019s business money.They go, oh, if it helps increase whatever their KPI is.I mean, that\u2019s, that\u2019s pretty big.Corey Maass: Yeah. And I\u2019ve got, I was just pinging, um, people within my client teams of like,okay, who generates social media content so that I can line up an interview, talk to them about,okay, what\u2019s your process? Um, and I, and what\u2019s kind of neat is, is again, I\u2019ve got. It\u2019stechnically the same, same [01:11:00] client, but I\u2019ve got two websites, two teams that approachthings very differently.One is, um, a lot more tech savvy and a lot more, um, trendy or, or, you know, they are active onTikTok. We are advertising on TikTok, stuff like that. And the other one is, is a fairly traditionalnews content magazine. Um, and, uh, with, and the, and the team is a lot less technical and we,and we don\u2019t need to be nearly as cutting edge or edge or trendy.Um, and so I\u2019m, I\u2019ve kind of got a young hip social media marketer wizard, and then I\u2019ve also gotpeople that are like, I write the article and then I go put it on Twitter. Um, and, and so I can kindof see how, how two of these very different approaches go about solving more or less the sameproblem. Yeah.Cory Miller: And that featured image summary card type thing I think is still [01:12:00] reallycompelling. I\u2019m gonna highlight that. Where\u2019s that? Yeah, I,Corey Maass: I, that\u2019s a very quick, easy win for anybody, not for us specifically. It\u2019s like makeyour featured image more compelling and, and much more valuable when shared.Cory Miller: And because again, you know, look at outputs for that, you go, well that\u2019s aPinterest thing. I mean, maybe that doesn\u2019t get pinned, but it\u2019s a social card. It could havepossibilities for the Pinterest stuff. It\u2019s a visual thing that en might entice someone to go, oh,that\u2019s interesting. Um, and that stuff like to just do that pull image from post add overlay of.\nThere you go. Print, you know, I mean, as simple as that with the brand logo. Yep. Dacon orsomething like that. Yep,Corey Maass: yep. [01:13:00] Okay. Yeah. And there\u2019s, and there\u2019s, yeah, and there\u2019s, there\u2019s acouple of plugins out there that do something that touch on that. Um, and I\u2019ve, I messed aroundwith one, not the other of the two that I know of, but they, they were, at least at the time, were,were limited to generating, um, an open graph image.I was like, generate image, paste it into Slack, you see the image. And I, and I was like, great,but I, where do I write? Click Save as so that I can go post it to Twitter. Mm-hmm. It\u2019s like, oh,you know, it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s just in, it\u2019s in your media library. It\u2019s like, okay, well, And thenalso what about all these other solutions or other scenarios?Um, for me, I was just originally thinking the big socials, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,Instagram. The big difference being 16, nine or square. But now we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s like,yeah, either easy ways to generate multiple variations and [01:14:00] stuff. It\u2019s like this could goa lot, a lot further. Um, so, but it\u2019s, but I definitely, you know, there\u2019s to talk about, you know,people talk about competition.It\u2019s like, oh, the competition is Photoshop, Canva, um, nothing, nothing is always a, acompetitor. Um, you know, but also I, you know, there are other WordPress plugins that dotouch on this, so we\u2019ll have to do a little research there too.Cory Miller: Yeah, like the nothing part is me. Um, I created a blog post and then it\u2019d beprobably nice to have some visual.Icon, thumbnail featured image that, um, highlight some points in there, but, um, okay. That\u2019ll be,mine is exploring that with, uh, I\u2019ll start with Emily cause she\u2019s doing a lot of the team interface,[01:15:00] cl team, client interface stuff. She seemed a pretty good volume of work. I like themarketing angle. How do we, cuz that could go across any of these potential avatars if we\u2019rehelping them do better marketing, um, redistribution, that\u2019s the social images of seo, all that kindof stuff.Corey Maass: Yeah. Um, well, and um, again, I,I wanna say I put my foot down cuz I think that\u2019s a hilarious phrase. In a Mad Men 1960shusband sort of way. I don\u2019t make me put my foot down. Um, but I, I, I want to, I very adamantlywanna draw the line at doing the posting or interacting with the socials. Um, other than like, wecan have a button that says, post this to Twitter and it just links, you know, we\u2019ll throw you overthere kind of thing.Cuz I\u2019ve actually even, I [01:16:00] built a plugin at one point that you could queue up tweets,but it\u2019s like, it worked. But, you know, with all the drama around Twitter, a p i lately, let alone forthe last Yeah. 10 years, like, I don\u2019t want to get into that. But, um, you know, one, one of the, wewere talking about. What are we talking about?We must have been talking about, um, integration points with other tools, um, for Crop Expressanyway, it\u2019s like, so if we generate images and then, and then I, you know, let\u2019s, we can look at,um, auto, you know, if you generate an, an open graph image that Yost automatically picks thatup. Um, so there\u2019s an integration point.Um, I use Buffer to post to mild my socials. Maybe they have an API or an integration point. Soit\u2019s like we can, you know, there\u2019s gonna be a potential for not only generating the images, but atleast getting them to the services that use those images. I don\u2019t wanna become those [01:17:00]services, but you know, there\u2019s, we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve got an opportunity there too.Cory Miller: Yeah. Okay. I put integrations with SEO plugins. Um,That, that questionwhen I talk to Emily, I\u2019ll ask, um, what, what are the common goals that they\u2019re, are they trying topush to a phone number? Are they trying to push to, um, an email list? It\u2019s probably one of thosetwo, I would guess is building the appeal, unless social startCorey Maass: higher up. Do they even, you know, are they thinking that strategically, like, not tosay the agency [01:18:00] isn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t, but as a client, like if a client comes to \u2019em as like,we need images for Twitter, like, because everybody else does or because you under, youknow, they understand.It\u2019s the value in including a phone number.Cory Miller: Now I do know, I do know, um, a lot of the clients they work with, and these are notWordPress or tech people, um, social is hot, you know?\nCorey Maass: Sure. Um, social hot, why, I guess, right? Mm-hmm. Cynically, are they doing itbecause everybody tells them to, you know, are there, are there teenage kids telling them, dad,you\u2019ve gotta get your, um, shoe com, you know, your air compressor company on the tos.And dad goes, okay, son, great, I\u2019ll do that. You know, or, or are they measuring? [01:19:00] Youknow, are they like, what, where does our traffic come from? Oh, we sell most of our aircompressors on Twitter, but not, or probably Facebook, but not on Twitter, and we\u2019ve never.Sold anything off of Insta, you know what I mean?Like, I\u2019m curious if, if, if, how companies are thinking about these, what am I trying to say? Weknow in, especially in the context of this conversation, that there\u2019s a potential to turn these patturn to turn passive images into valuable calls to action. Mm-hmm. To actually generate, youknow, it\u2019s like I post an image, I post, I post something on Twitter.It sucks In the featured image. The featured image is, you know, a pretty sunset. It, it might drawa human\u2019s attention, but that\u2019s very different than again the card. Uh, the [01:20:00] s e o cardthat I saw here, that\u2019s like words that are also drawing me in to like a phone number. So it\u2019s like,wow, I don\u2019t even have to click through.To, uh, to find out a phone number. I\u2019m just dialing eight eighty eight, et cetera. Mm-hmm. So it\u2019slike there\u2019s, I, I\u2019m curious how people are thinking about it, if they\u2019re thinking about it, because ifnot, like there\u2019s great opportunity to ask for us to do education, um mm-hmm. And, or cuz it\u2019slike, we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve talked about, this is the first time you\u2019ve mentioned phone numbers.Um, so it\u2019s like, you know, our, our default is like, oh, this is gonna go on Twitter and it\u2019s gonnalook pretty, it\u2019s gonna be the title of the post. Um, you know, with bullet points. It\u2019s a tldr, but likewhat you just said I think is amazing of like, imagine if for a small business, if it included thephone number, the logo, and the phone number.So it\u2019s like nobody ever, or the address, right? Mm-hmm. So people don\u2019t see it on Facebook orsee it on Twitter and they don\u2019t even have to click through.Cory Miller: [01:21:00] Mm-hmm. Then it\u2019s an ad, right? Like, Retail shop coming up withsomething, they\u2019ve got an event, a coupon or something that could, they\u2019re posting on theirwebsite, so it\u2019s RSVPs and then having a card that they could just easily go export or, you know,save or whatever it is, and then they can go post that.Corey Maass: How is the, we have a, a pie shop in town. How are they generating the imagefor their daily specials? Are they going into Canva every day?Yep. The sandwich shop, the, you know, all the food trucks that are posting their location, andthis is taking it way out of the context of a post.[01:22:00]Which is where something like Canva makes more sense. Like people are doing it, generatingan image unto itself. Right. My friend, um, Mike has the epic food truck that makes unbelievablebrisket and meat filled happiness, um, out of his food truck. Um, so he has to consistently postwhere he\u2019s at, what are today\u2019s specials, and this is, and I\u2019ll post them on the local Facebookgroups and people go running us too.So I\u2019m like, okay, I should ask him how he\u2019s generating and I need to think back. It\u2019s like, is hegenerating images? Is he upload? I kind of feel like he\u2019s uploading the same logo every timeand then writing the content, but, and so is there value in all of the content being on the image?I don\u2019t know. I have to think about that.I\u2019m sure you\u2019d wanna include the words [01:23:00] too, but, right. Yeah. I might have aconversation with him.Cory Miller: Yeah, I think that\u2019d be great. Um, I\u2019ll do one with, uh, Emily, see where that goes.And then I, I just shared the, uh, this whiteboard with you in Slack. Great. I have a friend.Thanks so much. This is, uh, this is good stuff.Okay. So I got my marching orders to talk to Emily about that, see what they\u2019re doing, see ifthere\u2019s ideas to like, drive the conversions that they need for post, explore some of the eBookstoo. I put course up here cause I think that\u2019s another thing. Yep. But, um, yeah, I was thinkingthat too.Corey Maass: Okay. Um, yeah, and I think I\u2019m gonna talk to, I\u2019ve got one or two people to talkto.Um, and I think, I think I will try to, I, well, I, like I said earlier, like I do want to. Make sure thatI\u2019m wrapping up Crop express properly. [01:24:00] Um, but then, you know, out of sheerexcitement, I imagine I\u2019ll reopen the, the plugin that I\u2019d started to build and see if I can get itworking enough to send it to you.\nOkay, cool. All right.Cory Miller: Thanks dude. Talk to you soon. I\u2019ll be talking to you.

They also highlight how managed hosting can help businesses focus on their core operations while leaving the technical aspects to the experts. \n\nEstimated Reading Time:  24 minutes\n\nTranscript \u00e2\u0086\u0093\nCory Miller is joined by Jess Friedman from WP Cloud discuss how hosting companies can improve their infrastructure and services to provide better performance and reliability to their customers. They also dive into the importance of customer support, the benefits of using managed hosting services, the ethics of data collection, and more. The experience and expertise offered are sure to inspire you to increase your standards of service\nTop Takeaways:\n\nOutsourcing Infrastructure. WordPress hosting companies can benefit from outsourcing their infrastructure to specialized providers such as WP Cloud. This can free up their customer support team from dealing with infrastructure-related issues and enable them to focus on providing better customer service and value-added services.\nIncrease Customer Satisfaction. By democratizing publishing and providing a superior WordPress experience, hosting companies can reduce churn and retain customers who may otherwise switch to other platforms if their WordPress experience is subpar.\nSet Up for Speed. While many factors can impact website speed, some of the most important ones include optimizing images, using a content delivery network (CDN), and minimizing the use of plugins. By focusing on these areas, WordPress agencies can help their clients improve their website speed and ultimately provide a better user experience for their visitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n Sponsor: A2 Hosting\nA2Hosting offers solutions for WordPress and WooCommerce that are both blazing fast and ultra-reliable.

I\u2019ve got a longtime friendof mine in the WordPress space. I think we met like 10 years ago, Jesse. Um, but we\u2019re gonnabe talking about WP Cloud today, and this is part of our product people series. Um, I heardabout WP Cloud, I know Jesse and I was like, Hey, I wanna know more about WP Cloud.It\u2019s really compelling from what I\u2019ve heard. Um, but first and foremost, welcome to the podcast.Jesse. Could you tell us a little bit about your.Jesse Friedman: Yeah. Thanks Corey. And yeah, it probably has been a decade. It\u2019s, it\u2019s, uh,it\u2019s awesome to, to be able to, uh, know people like you and be able to work with people like youfor so long.Um, and that\u2019s one of the great things about the WordPress community, right? Oh, yeah. Uh,yeah. So, uh, I, I, uh, got started in WordPress, geez, back in 2005, I think. Uh, I was, uh,working as a professor at a university and, uh, trying to teach, [00:01:00] uh, students, uh, wellactually I was a student at the time and then later I became a professor and started teachingWordPress.Uh, but my professor, Hillary Mason, who\u2019s actually, used to work at Bitly and is pretty worldrenowned, uh, data scientist. She, she turned me onto WordPress and, uh, I never looked back.Uh, prior to that I was building like static websites. Um, and, uh, and WordPress, uh, is not just apiece of software, right?It\u2019s a community of people that, uh, help to kind of raise the level of everyone who works on it.Um, and that, that\u2019s where I got my career jump off. It was, uh, it was definitely with WordPressfor sure. That\u2019s awesome.Cory Miller: Well, we met when you\u2019re part of Brute Protect and uh, I was asking in the pre-rollabout your art in the background.I\u2019m a big fan of art. Yeah. I wanna get some from the walls, but tell me, tell me more about theart in the background cuz I was like, Hey, we met when you were part of Brute Protect before itwas acquired by automatic. And you kind of pointed to the [00:02:00] lightning in the back. So,yeah, tell me more.Jesse Friedman: Yeah. So actually before we jump in here, this is an not an, uh, chronologicalorder, but I was actually working for a company called Astonish, uh, where I actually got to builda, a, a large web team.I actually still work with one colleague from that company, Jeff Kalinsky. He works at Automaticnow. Uh, when we were tasked with building, um, or converting a. source.net based cms, uh,from an old product called Blue Squid, uh, to a new WordPress powered multi-site. And it wasgonna house like 4,000 sites.Um, and so we, I found this at like a art show. Uh, bought it, hung it on the wall, and uh, and wespent a year building this new platform. The funny thing about it, this is a really unique story.Didn\u2019t give us access to the source files. Uh, and they kind of held everything hostage. This thirdparty company that we were host, host, hosting everything with.Um, so we actually had to build a, like a [00:03:00] w get scraper. To scrape our own websitesand convert them into WordPress themes. So we didn\u2019t even like turn them into Ion out, weturned them into full blown WordPress themes on a multisite. And, uh, we were able to move allthose sites over very quickly. Um, and so I asked that same artist, I said, Hey, can you paint a, aharpoon now that Blue Squid is dead?It\u2019s this old product. And so we hung that up on the wall and that, and that was that. I left thatcompany and co-founded Brew Protect. Uh, brew Protect was a cloud powered. Um, Uh, botnetprevention service. So like anyone who\u2019s trying to brute force into your website, we used, uh,data that we would gather from attack vectors from different various, uh, areas.And it was really the first time that I was able to say like, we\u2019re building something that leveragesinformation that we gained from multiple hosting partnerships to better the entire WordPresscommunity. Because everything that was happening before then was hosts would gather attackvectors against their own infrastructure, and that was the only thing they could [00:04:00] learnfrom.But what we did was we grabbed that information from across different hosting companies, uh,across customers who were around the globe, and we were able to really do a better job of\nthwarting those attacks. Um, and so that represents cloud data raining down on a, a botnet, uh,going outta business there.And then, uh, yeah, and so then we got, uh, acquired by Automatic back in 2014, and I joinedthe Jet Pack team. Uh, I\u2019ve been working on hosting partnerships and. Product development forJet Pack for almost nine years now. And, uh, then we started, uh, you know, launched WP Cloudlast year.Cory Miller: So it has been 10 years.Because I met you all right before the automatic acquisition. Acquisition. Yeah. Yeah. Um, man,well, some nostalgia there. Um, so what\u2019s, what\u2019s, uh, really compelling, what you just said too,is Jet. So when I knew you all got required and got got to meet you and Sam [00:05:00]Hotchkis, and then at some point I realized, Sam, and you were on the jet pack team and at Ithewe.Felt like we were competitors to Jet Pack in many ways, um, from backups and security. And Iwas like, oh no, these, these guys are gonna take jet pack to the next level. And I\u2019ve definitelyseen, I think, what is probably the product of your work over the years where it\u2019s like, oh no.Okay, Sam, Jesse getting in there, um, with Jet Pack.So, uh, that\u2019s a, I wanted to mention that cuz I\u2019ve thought that many times. I think I\u2019ve expressedthat to Sam. Um, but. Anyway, thanks for that background. That\u2019s, that\u2019s really compelling. Backto the old static h CML days. Woo. Thanks WordPress. Yeah. So Jesse, let\u2019s talk about WPCloud. I know, um, we\u2019ve talked a couple times about this and I, what, I know I can throw this atyou and you\u2019ll, you just, you just hit it out of the part and, uh, but tell me really succinctly, whatdo you [00:06:00] think? What is WP Cloud?.Jesse Friedman: WP Cloud is a WordPress focus cloud platform that we built within automaticto power the highest and most trafficked websites in the world. Um, and to provide a very uniquesolution, uh, that gets very close to, if not a hundred percent up time. Um, and so we\u2019re doingsomething that\u2019s a little bit different than what you see with other cloud platforms.We provide vertical scaling and automated real-time fail. So what we want to do is provide asolution that, again, is 100% WordPress focused, but allows you to stop thinking about hostingaltogether. You don\u2019t have to worry about it anymore. We\u2019re gonna take care of all theinfrastructure, keep it up and running, keep it high performance, and, uh, let hosting companiesor others focus on what they do best, um, to provide a, a fantastic experience to customer.Cory Miller: Well, anytime you say something around wordpress.com infrastructure, I alwaysgo, holy [00:07:00] cow. Yeah. When you can say, pretty near, I know you\u2019re being humbled too,but like that, that system is renowned because it\u2019s incredible. I mean, people that work on, uh,the platform and what it does, but. Now, who\u2019s it? Who\u2019s it really for?When you think about WP Cloud, you kind of maybe mentioned this, but I wanna drill down onthat. Who do you think it\u2019s really for?Jesse Friedman: Yeah. All right. So if we look at the actual, uh, hosting, uh, platform itself, it\u2019sfor anyone who wants to have high availability, high performant websites. Uh, but if we look atthe brand WP Cloud, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve decided to take, um, the entire platform and, andgive.A brand that we can then go to hosting companies with and, and provide services to hostingcompanies. So WP Cloud is not interested in individual customers, uh, small agencies, thingslike that. What we\u2019re actually interested in doing is providing services to hosting companies[00:08:00] to help them provide. Better hosting.Um, you can think about WP Cloud as a utility service, like the electrical grid underground, uh,providing services to customers all, all around the globe. But, um, allowing those hostingcompanies to, uh, maintain their experience, the things that differentiate themselves, all of. But ifyou\u2019re, if you\u2019re listening to this and you\u2019re thinking, oh, I have one website or 10 websites and Iwant to host them and I don\u2019t want to have to worry about, um, downtime or, or speed issues oranything like that, I would suggest going straight to one of WP Cloud\u2019s partners, pressable, forexample.Mm-hmm.Cory Miller: So when we were prepping for this, I said, Hey, so this, this pa uh, this isleveraging the.com platform, and you corrected me. Share a little bit more about that.Jesse Friedman: Yeah, sure. So, uh, so what we did was we took the minds and, and thepeople behind wordpress.com powering hundreds of millions of sites there.\nWe took the [00:09:00] same, um, experienced individuals who were helping to power some ofthe, um, most powerful websites on v i p. Uh, we took the experience that we had from RunningPressable, which is, um, like a, uh, a managed WordPress host that we, uh, use to, um, really.Test and grow our own product base. And so we took all those things and we said, what, howcan we build a cloud platform that\u2019s gonna service all of the needs that we have internally, um,and, and provide the absolute best experience?And so when we did that, we ended up launching, uh, what we called internally, uh, productcalled Atomic, uh, and that is now powering uh, wordpress.com business and e-commerceplans. Pressable News Pack. And so that was, uh, similar to like how a w s got born. You know,a, uh, Amazon was an e-commerce platform that was dealing with scale issues.They couldn\u2019t compensate for [00:10:00] the amount of the influx of traffic, so they had to reallysit down and think about how they can rebuild their entire platform. Um, and so then that\u2019s howaw w s was born. It\u2019s not too dissimilar from what we\u2019re doing. We have built a platform that isnow powering, um, 13 billion page views.Um, and, uh, with sites that are experiencing incredibly fast speed under load. Um, and, andnow we\u2019re saying to ourselves like, well, we know we built something amazing here. We knowthat it\u2019s something that we can really give back to the community as a way to raise the bar forcloud hosting across, across the board.Um, and so now that, that is the, that is the effort there is we\u2019ve powered. Internally what weneed to, to make sure that everything runs smoothly. So again, if anybody wants to try out WPCloud, sign up for a wordpress.com business site, sign up for pressable. Um, you\u2019ll feel thespeed, [00:11:00] uh, the proof is in, in the, uh, experience right there.Um, but then WP Cloud is really now focused on how it can provide services to hosting.Cory Miller: Yeah. I love that I\u2019ve observed from the industry being in as long as both of us havethat, you know, there was this day where you started seeing some of the really big hostingcompanies start go moving. There WordPress stuff over to the cloud.Yeah, there\u2019s a lot of bumpy roads along that way, but um, your comparison with aws forinstance, cuz I\u2019ve heard Google Cloud, aws, some of those offerings kind of moving over andthat\u2019s the way it feels like it\u2019s shifting. I\u2019m not a technical person, but I\u2019ve been in the space along time and I go, it makes sense to have cloud-based hosting, especially for WordPress.And then you get specific WordPress expertise. That knows that application better than anybodyI\u2019d, I\u2019d, I\u2019d challenge anybody to say, do you know more about WordPress and automatic teams?Yeah. Um,Jesse Friedman: we definitely leveraged our, our own internal expertise to solve for that. And,and you\u2019re right. I [00:12:00] mean, you look at hosting companies and they\u2019re trying to figureout ways to differentiate themselves outside of the infrastructure.A lot of them are moving to Google Cloud or aw. Um, the shared hosting is still, you know,mostly the same kind of solution, um, that everyone is kind of racing to the bottom on pricing on.Mm-hmm. Um, and so, so how are hosts differentiating themselves? Well, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019smade on top of promises of speed and performance and, and security.But the reality of the situation is the, the infrastructure underneath is actually not. That different.So hosting companies are really focused on trying to differentiate themselves now in the way inwhich they market themselves. The onboarding experience that provide the partnerships thatthey can leverage to provide a better experience to customers.The speed at which you can launch your site, the customer service, those are all things thatHUS hosting companies really f are, are focused on, and. Frankly, the places where they can,they can really win. One of the conversations I had at cloudfest, uh, which was a conferencethat we went to, um, [00:13:00] two weeks ago, was about the power of diversity within hosting.Um, and so I think that it\u2019s really important to recognize that, especially when we\u2019re talking aboutWP Cloud, helping to power those hosting companies in terms of like a utility. Um, you look atsomething like shop. And or, or w and they have these global solutions for every single, um,customer across the world.Um, but you know, we, we know why that\u2019s not, uh, advantageous and why WordPress is better.But one of the major advantages that WordPress has is that, um, the hosting companies candefine the niche that they wanna solve. They can solve problems specific for geographicallylocations. WordPress has seeded itself into hosting companies around the globe.\nSo the solutions you get from a hosting company in let\u2019s say the Netherlands, is completelydifferent than what you might get in Malaysia or Africa. Um, and so that\u2019s an advantage that thathosting companies have in that diversity. And so, uh, you know, if we can come [00:14:00] inand try to help and provide better services at that infrastructural, Then that frees those hostingcompanies up to think about ways in which they can differentiate themselves and provide theabsolute best experience to those, to those customers.Cory Miller: Take care of wordPress, you got the power of WP Cloud, the.com top experienceand do other stuff on top that adds value for your customers. Yeah, exactly. So. I know havingbeen acquired, our company was acquired by hosting company, uh, been on the inside of thatand realizing how much, you know, they, they really worry all, all hosting companies about price.Um, yeah. Anytime you, you know, c panel was this big conversation in the industry for a longtime because they started cranking at prices and everybody started fleeing because they\u2019re like,they felt held hostage. But I know every penny accounts in hosting. So Can you talk a little bitabout the pricing structure for WP.And I know that this is still early.Jesse Friedman: It is still early, and I [00:15:00] appreciate that and, uh, I probably shy awayfrom getting into the super specifics of pricing right now, but what I can tell you is this, is that theway in which WP Cloud Scales is based on the number of pH p workers, uh, CPUs. Uh, andstorage that you want.And so what we want to create are ways in which hosting companies can come in, um, andcreate bespoke offerings to either power their managed WordPress offering now, or to start byoffering the higher tier hosting that they haven\u2019t been able to offer before. If you look at most ofthe hosting companies in the world, a lot of them cap out at a hundred bucks, 150 bucks amonth.Um, and so then you leave, uh, the super high end. Hosting customers to, to either fend forthemselves with their own cloud platform to go to, uh, you know, higher, higher end managedhosting. Um, or something like W P V I P. What we wanna do is be able to provide services thatgo from that range, from, uh, 25 bucks a month to [00:16:00] $2,000 a month, um, and to beable to provide consistent uptime throughout all of that.So hosting companies will be able to come in and use WP. Um, and, and if they want to go witha lower tier, like two PHP workers, two CPUs, this is getting super technical. That\u2019s still built forlike 400,000 sustained visitors a month, uh, which is gonna compensate for, you know, most.Customers that\u2019s only gonna cost that hosting company a few bucks a month with WP Cloud.Um, and then, and then it scales up from there. And since we\u2019re talking about scaling, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll, I\u2019lljust say one thing is, is that we offer something that\u2019s pretty unique in that we don\u2019t, uh, we don\u2019treserve, uh, we, we don\u2019t have any limitations on visits. So if you take a look at other hostingcompanies, you\u2019ll see that they create, uh, they\u2019ll create really robust, powerful servers.And then they\u2019ll put traffic limits on it. Mm-hmm. I\u2019m thinking of a hosting company right now[00:17:00] that has, um, a robust amount of power, uh, allows for up to 40 WordPress websitesand only, uh, and stops at like 400,000 visits a month. Mm-hmm. Well, if you only have 10,000visits a month, you don\u2019t need all that power anyway.Uh, even if you\u2019re not sharing it across all of those things, that\u2019s just a waste of power. That\u2019s aLamborghini on the, on the back of a flatbed pickup truck. You know what I mean? Like you\u2019renot taking full advantage of that. WP Cloud is gonna come in and, and basically say, uh, we\u2019regoing to create bespokes solutions that are designed to house the amount of traffic that you\u2019re,or serve the amount of traffic that you\u2019re bringing.Uh, but we\u2019re not gonna limit you on, on the amount of traffic that you have there. Um, so thereare no real, uh, traffic limitations with WP Cloud, unlike other hosting companies.Cory Miller: Yeah, it, I don\u2019t know all the specs, but I know enough to go when they put a trafficthing, there\u2019s something underneath that they\u2019re trying to be careful of when they put limits andthings.But, um, [00:18:00] so that, that\u2019s a conversation for another well, unless you.Jesse Friedman: Well, I was just gonna say that it\u2019s a way for them to mitigate their, their, theirrisk and their costs. Yeah. Um, but we, we have built a platform that we know can scale to anyamount of traffic. So, uh, we\u2019re, we\u2019re gonna differentiate ourselves there.\nCory Miller: Yeah. Um, so I think you said fully managed performance security and WordPress.What does that mean?Jesse Friedman: It means that we\u2019re literally gonna take care of it all for you. So in terms ofsecurity, uh, it has built-in backup solutions. So it\u2019s actually pretty unique in the way in which wedo backups. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re gonna touch on automated failovers soon.But the way we do our backups is that we do, um, daily file backups and hourly databasebackups, but we don\u2019t just store that on the same box. What we do is we put it onto another datacenter. On another box that actually has power ready so that we can switch to that if we need to.We can talk about that in a second.Um, but we [00:19:00] do, it comes with s ssl, it comes with, uh, TLS encryption. It comes with,uh, WAF DDoS protection. I\u2019m telling you. Like we harden the heck out of it. Yeah. Um, and thenin, in addition to that, we automatically build in a c. No extra cost. It has a CDN built into it. Um,and it, uh, also resizes your images.So you\u2019re only serving the size of the image that you need high resolution, but you\u2019re not servingthese 10 megabyte images that people upload straight from their phone to their WordPressinstance, right? We\u2019re resizing it and only showing the size that you need for the device that\u2019srequesting it. Uh, we also do, uh, automated caching built in too.Um, and. It\u2019s all run by our team internally, so there is really no tweaking or configuring oranything that you have to do. Um, it\u2019s 100% fully managed outta the box. That also includes themanagement of things like P H p, uh, database. Um, it manages, uh, WordPress core [00:20:00]files, certain plug-ins. It allows for templating and staging.Um, and again, we handle all of that. It\u2019s not, these aren\u2019t things that you\u2019re gonna have to.Cherry pick based on price or anything. It\u2019s all 100% inclusive in the product.Cory Miller: So I, you mentioned principle way earlier. I\u2019m a paying, and I wanna say that reallyloud and clear. I\u2019m a paying customer principle.Yeah. So I\u2019ve seen this, the performance, all these things. And, uh, so that, that\u2019s, that\u2019s prettyawesome. But I, I wanted to push in on that because I\u2019m a, this is my comment, not. But whenyou say managed, you always, I always go, tell me what that really means. Yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s like,you know, the Tommy Boys, like you can slap a label on the side, but it\u2019s, you know, whatactually happens inside.And I think that\u2019s one thing that differentiate, differentiates, uh, any automatic brand is it\u2019s not alabel on the outside. Um, yeah. Okay. So tell me what automated realtime fellows.Jesse Friedman: So we touched on this briefly, right? [00:21:00] So if we, if we back up yourentire site to another location and we put that back up on a box that has power, um, and you\u2019reserving traffic to one location, we can automatically detect some kind of, any kind of issue.So even if there was catastrophic failure, uh, you know, a pipe got cut. Uh, the data centeractually you. We have tons of redundancies in terms of power and things like that, but like, let\u2019sjust say like a volcano erupted or something like that, you know, something really catastrophic.We can in real time redirect that traffic to another data center that already has your site live on itand already has, uh, the, the power behind it.So we can in real time, switch that traffic and people will not experience any downtime. And thatis something that is nearly impossible with other cloud platforms. It is possible, but it\u2019s incrediblyexpensive. And because of the scale that we operate at, uh, and the WordPress efficiency thatwe [00:22:00] have, um, we\u2019ve been able to, to build that into the platform.Cory Miller: See, when you talked about backups earlier, it\u2019s something to know about havinghelped lead our product, uh, for backups. And when you said that one thing, it\u2019s not on thatserver. It\u2019s somewhere else within a vast infrastructure. That\u2019s really compelling to me becausewe would tell customers all the time, don\u2019t just don\u2019t back up on that server because what\u2019s,what\u2019s it gonna do for you when it crashes?Um, so like, I love the secure, the backup feature of that. It\u2019s not just a. A backup if somethinghappens. And this was way before all this technology existed today, but that\u2019s how we got thebackup is like into our product. Is it crashed? We didn\u2019t have, we had backups maybe on thatserver. And literally the hard drive was like capoot.And so that was our mantra. Always remote, offsite, you know, so that you can restore and. IncaseJesse Friedman: we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve seen this, I, I\u2019ll [00:23:00] leave hosting companies names out ofthis, this conversation, but we\u2019ve all seen hosting companies that have had. Catastrophic failure.\nUm, data center fires, for example, things like that.Uh, and if you\u2019re not backing up, this is getting into like a conversation about Jet Pack two, butlike, if you\u2019re not backing up your, your website offsite, you\u2019re susceptible to that. Mm-hmm. Um,and that, that can be, um, unbelievably painful. I can\u2019t tell you how many conversations I hadwith people who say, well, I\u2019ll worry about security later, or I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll, you know, I don\u2019t really careabout backups right now.I just wanna get my site. But all the time you\u2019re investing in that, right? You\u2019re building yourwebsite. Think about the dozens of hours of time that you\u2019re spending tweaking all those things.And if you lose that, it\u2019s, it\u2019s not just catastrophic failure for the host, it\u2019s catastrophic failure forthe site owner too.It\u2019s, it\u2019s incredibly painful and to, you know, some, some people out there have stronger will thanI to start all over from the beginning, but I don\u2019t, but that\u2019s, [00:24:00] sometimes I felt that painyou left with doing.Cory Miller: Yeah, I, I felt that. Yeah. Um, we were, we were scraping. We had some clients atthe time and scraping data from Google Cash to redo websites, and so I felt that pain.Yeah. So we\u2019ve talked about, um, the power, performance, security, all these things that arebaked into WP Cloud, that powers.com business, eCommerce plans. But how about the,Preserving and growing the hosting experience. What are your thoughts on that? So key, keyclient for this is our hosting companies, um, to be able to really leverage all of this for, I mean,when you said utility tool, it really rang a bell for me.It\u2019s like, okay, all of this at a re, very. Reasonable price, and I know they need to talk to youabout all those things. But yeah, let\u2019s, let\u2019s talk about that hosting experience a little bit. Tell me,tell me your thoughts on that related to WP Club.Jesse Friedman: So every single [00:25:00] host that, and I\u2019ve worked with a lot of hostingcompanies, every single host has a unique experience.Uh, the signup flow is typically about the same, but the second that you get into that WordPressinstance being launched, Unique onboarding flows. You get unique sets of tools. Um, thedifferent combinations of the way in which they combine, uh, partnerships they have withsecurity or performance companies.Um, And then the platform, the platform is always really unique. Um, a lot of them are built ontop of cPanel or Plak. I think something like 70, 80% of all hosts use that technology. Mm-hmm.Um, and sometimes you feel it and sometimes you don\u2019t. Like, there are certain hostingcompanies that are just using cPanel.It literally says cPanel and you, and you know what you\u2019re on. But then there are other hostingcompanies that have built a completely custom bespoke solution that\u2019s layered on top of. Nomatter what it is, um, that, that again is how you\u2019re differentiating yourself. Um, so if I look at sixhosting companies that are using the same [00:26:00] basic boxes to do shared WordPresshosting, they\u2019re the only difference.There is price, but we\u2019re all. All hosting companies are racing to the bottom on price, and we\u2019re,we\u2019re talking about a difference of a few bucks a month. Um, so then what is it that you get withthat hosting that\u2019s really gonna differentiate \u2019em? And so most people are either makingdecisions based on the fact that they have a recommendation from a friend, or they\u2019re taking alook at, uh, you know, the, the, the bespoke solutions that are coming bundled with that.The great thing about WP Cloud is that it has no platform. It has no user interface. It is 100%API driven. So for any hosting company to use it, it has to work underneath every single thingthat they\u2019ve already built. Um, and so it can work with C Panel, it can work with Plesk, uh, or itcan work with whatever bespoke solution you have.Um, but your, um, Unveiling of the use of WP Cloud is up to you as a host and company. You[00:27:00] can go one way and say, Similar to, I think like WP Engine does this with like a w s orGoogle Cloud. They say like, you know, proudly like we\u2019re partnered with this company to, tolaunch this. Um, and the same way that Pressable does this with like WP Cloud or Grid Pain,uh, you know, they say proudly powered by WP Cloud.And that\u2019s starting to mean something as we start to have more of these conversations andmore people understand what WP Cloud really is. But, um, WP Cloud also offers a completely.Uh, an option that allows you to basically use our infrastructure without ever mentioning us. Youcould even bring your own IP addresses if you wanted to, um, and then take use of the entire\ninfrastructure underneath it, uh, without having to disclose that it\u2019s not something that\u2019shomegrown.Um, so however the host and company wants to work in that, in that area makes sense to us.Uh, what we want to do is just really. Allow them to refocus their efforts away from things like[00:28:00] managing WordPress or handling security or dealing with uptime. The other thing I\u2019lltalk about too is, um, cost to serve.Cost to serve is something that\u2019s on the mind of every single hosting company. Uh, whenPressable moved onto WP Cloud, we saw a dramatic decrease in, um, support tickets related toanything infrastructure rate, limiting DDoS, anything like. Um, and the same thing withwordpress.com, uh, wordpress.com business and e-commerce customers.They\u2019re not, uh, reaching out and asking for support on anything related to the box or how fasttheir site is performing. What they are asking questions about is more things around how canthey be successful. How can you know what plugins should I use for this? Or, or that that\u2019s yourdecision as a host and company decide pr provide support in that area or not.But I can tell you that when you relieve your host, your, your happiness engineers, yourcustomer service team, from the burden of having to figure out why a site is down or why it\u2019s[00:29:00] performing so slowly, it gives them the ability. You know, focus on what keeps thosecustomers there for the long term, reducing churn, which is what every host and company thinksabout.Pressable had something like 36,000 tickets last year. Less than half of a percentage of themwere even associated with anything, uh, related to to infrastructure. And I even read some ofthem. And a lot of them were just questions about how, how Pressable goes about handling.Um, so we\u2019ve basically eliminated support for, for hosting.Cory Miller: That\u2019s the headline right there for, for WordPress hosting that, that\u2019s the headline ofthe interview today. For sure. Well, um, Jesse, we\u2019ve covered a lot, but I wanna make sure wedidn\u2019t miss anything. Um, I think it\u2019s an incredibly compelling service. Could help really raise thestandard of the hosting industry for WordPress.Um, that\u2019s exactly. So what, uh, [00:30:00] and, and this is the note I wanted to say about thehosting experiences like that, uh, I think that frees a hosting company to also innovate on thatapplication labor. What things, whether it\u2019s plugins, themes, services on top that add value forwho their customers are and what they\u2019re trying to get.And I think that\u2019s, that\u2019s pretty dang cool. If I were in that seat hosting product, uh, manager, I\u2019dbe like, okay, this is taken care of. It\u2019s base lever, le level here. Now how can we set ourselvesapart by adding value to who our customers are? But is there anything with that, um, we left at,or you wanna mention?Jesse Friedman: Well, I\u2019ll actually just pick up right there where you, uh, you mentioned about,uh, hosting companies. I think one thing to remember is, is that, Our mission at Automatic morethan anything is to provide, um, and democratize publishing. We know that, but it\u2019s, it\u2019s alsoabout making sure that WordPress is not only [00:31:00] readily available, but performing at alevel that, um, allows you to focus on getting the word out about your business or your politicalviews or whatever it might be.Um, but hosting companies, uh, are experiencing incredible churn right now. Uh, we. This waslike the number one topic at that conference I mentioned earlier. Cloud Fest, um, hostingcompanies are seeing extreme churn, and the problem is, is that when someone churns from ahosting company that is specifically for WordPress, they don\u2019t churn and go, they don\u2019t tryhosting company a.Say, oh, my WordPress experience wasn\u2019t so great there. I\u2019m gonna go try hosting company Band try WordPress there, and then I\u2019m gonna try hosting company C and try WordPress there.That\u2019s not really What happens is that they give WordPress a shot on whatever hostingcompany they\u2019ve chosen. And if that fails, uh, or that doesn\u2019t work out for them, a lot of themend up going to something else.And so that one opportunity to provide a [00:32:00] superior WordPress experience is reallywhere we want to help, right? So if we can take care of the, the infrastructure, the hosting, thesecurity, the performance, and make sure that everyone has this like level set, amazing hostingexperience in terms of the infrastructure.I wanna touch on the exact, like, I wanna reiterate what you just said, which is that that allowshosting companies to innovate on what they can do to provide better onboarding, reduce time to\nlive, which is how fast they can launch their site, helping to make sure customers aresuccessful, focus your time on marketing so that customers sites, once they\u2019re launched, theycan actually gain traffic and, and really help them to achieve their business goals.And the other thing that I just wanted to touch on real quick too is, is just, uh, we talked a little bitabout scaling, but one of the things I do wanna mention is, is that, um, so these are bare metalboxes that we built up that we own. They\u2019re, we\u2019re not outsourcing anything at all. Um, and wehave 28 data centers around the globe already that are ours, uh, powering this entireinfrastructure.[00:33:00] Um, and then, uh, when someone. Hit with traffic, an extreme amount of traffic. Whattypically happens with other, um, cloud platforms is that they replicate everything onto aseparate box and they try to throw additional boxes at the problem. But the problem is that ifyou\u2019re down, because you can\u2019t service the amount of traffic that you\u2019re handling, you have towait for that extra box to spool up, or you\u2019re paying for it to be laying in weight.Right. What we can do actually is what we do is vertical scaling. So we have the option to throwmore PHPs and more CPUs at the problem until we\u2019ve compensated for the amount of trafficthat you have. But this is where things get really unique. We go when we build out hostingplans. As I said before, hosts can build plans between two and say 30 PHP workers and CPUs.That\u2019s built for sustained traffic of 400,000 visits to 15 million visits. Um, but now let\u2019s say youhave an e-commerce website that got featured on the wire cutter, or you have, uh, a productthat you\u2019ve been [00:34:00] ready to release and you have a huge wait list, uh, and everyone\u2019sgonna slam your site at the same exact time.WP Cloud has a very unique opportunity that we can burst to 110 PhD P workers in CPUs. Andthen what we\u2019re talking about then is, is handling the type of traffic that like the Washington Postgets when they release an article about what\u2019s happening in our, in our government, or. C n ntraffic, you know what I mean?Mm-hmm. Um, and so those, those are the types of things that we\u2019re, we\u2019re mainly focused onso that we can provide, you know, v i p level hosting, um, and allow hosting companies to breakout of that shared hosting and the cheaper managed hosting, and to really offer something to,you know, to any of those customers that are, that are experiencing incredibly high.Cory Miller: I wanna go back to something you said because I absolutely, it rings true with me,is that if the hosting experience is not good, particularly on the WordPress as an applicationlayer, [00:35:00] um, yeah, we\u2019re, we\u2019re not, we\u2019re doing a disservice to the entire industrybecause we\u2019re. Turning a WordPress person into another Com competitor.And you know, I\u2019ve been in this space a long time and I go, you know, I woke up a year ago andgo, wow, there\u2019s very solid competitors to WordPress now out there. And if we want to, as thebusiness eco ecosystem of WordPress continued to have this incredible thriving grow.Ecosystem and the software. Then we, you know, we used to say like, you need two things.You need a domain name and you need WordPress hosting to Yep. To buy our products. Andthen again to those agencies out there who we serve, um, at post tennis and are building onthat, that love, that inflow and growth that we\u2019ve all enjoyed with the growth of WordPress, thenwe need to be serious about this conversation in the hosting experience because, You hit it righton the nail.They\u2019re not leaving the hosting [00:36:00] company. Just the hosting company. They\u2019re leavingpotentially WordPress. And that\u2019s the bell I want to keep ringing, is that as an industry, we needto do things like this. This is, this is a key pillar. I think. Um, there\u2019s other things that we need tobe doing as a WordPress business ecosystem to keep this healthy, thriving, growing.And, uh, I\u2019m glad you mentioned that because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve seen, um, too, but that justgives a real world experience of like, if these hosting companies are having churn, it\u2019s not justthem, it\u2019s all of us. And there, there\u2019s a brand that we\u2019ve had with WordPress that has beenawesome and I\u2019m incredibly grateful for the brand and the open source software.So I appreciate you mentioning that .Jesse Friedman: Yeah, of course. Yeah. If you remember the old days of the five minute install,um, I do. That was basically, uh, yeah. And for anyone who\u2019s listening, who, who may not befamiliar with that, cuz it\u2019s, it\u2019s been enough years now. Uh, when you used to get a, [00:37:00] a,a new hosting account, it never really came pre-built with WordPress, uh, out of the box, you\u2019dhave to.\nDownload WordPress from wordpress.org, re-upload it, sftp, build a database. Um, and then thefive minute install came out and it was like this brilliant way of like launching a WordPresswebsite super fast. And that was the moment I think that husband companies decided like, waita minute, we can actually like really create custom WordPress experiences.Because it\u2019s no longer in charge of the customer to actually launch a WordPress website. It\u2019snow up to the, the host to actually launch that instance. And that\u2019s when they started packagingtheir own plugins, their own themes into it, providing their own unique solutions. And that\u2019s allwell and good. Um, but I think there is a responsibility to those hosts, to the larger ecosystem tomake sure that we\u2019re, we\u2019re furthering the mission across the board.Um, and so their churn is definitely a reflection of the larger ecosystems. Hundred percent.Cory Miller: I mean, that affects all of our members that post us from product companies,[00:38:00] professionals that do WordPress love, being able to do pre WordPress as their careerand the agency serving their clients out. Across the world.So a hundred percent agree. And this, this is something we\u2019ll have to change the headline a littlebit and add to it because it\u2019s my personal viewpoint that we need to, all of us collectively look atthe industry and go, what makes it healthier for everybody? And this is a, this is part of theconversation, so it matters, this conversation today, even if they don\u2019t choose to go with WPCloud, that we need to be thinking about this experience for the overall health of, of the industry.Yeah. Absolut. For sure, Jesse, my friend. Um, so if somebody\u2019s interested and wants to talkmore about W Cloud, what do they do?Jesse Friedman: So if you\u2019re a hosting company and uh, you wanna partner with WP Cloud, goto wp.cloud. Uh, it\u2019ll load so fast, you think it\u2019s a local site. Uh, so that\u2019ll be your first taste of thepower of WP Cloud.Uh, funny [00:39:00] enough, that site is actually hosted by Pressable on just a regular account.Nothing special. Um, so, uh, you\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll see how that works if you\u2019re thinking. Moving yourown personal sites or your businesses sites, um, and you\u2019re not a hosting company, but youwant to, you want to try out WP Cloud, take a look at our partners.So we have, uh, wordpress.com Pressable, uh, if you\u2019re a news site, you could try News PackGrid Pain now offers, um, uh, WP Cloud as well. And, uh, and uh, yeah, we have some otherpartners coming down the pike too. Uh, that will be, uh, will be.Cory Miller: Let me know when the newpartners come in.
