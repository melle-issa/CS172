The university's planning process, as designed, represents\n                        the first comprehensive initiative around the development of a university-wide strategic\n                        plan.\n                     \nThe Strategic Planning Steering Committee, with support from nationally-recognized\n                        experts, has developed and is leading the university-wide process, which will lead\n                        to the development of the strategic plan. The Strategic Planning Steering Committee\n                        is charged with overseeing and supporting the planning process, and includes a number\n                        of sub-committees and working groups focused on data and assessment, mission and vision\n                        and also diversity, equity and inclusion. Learn more about those involved by visiting\n                        the Teams section.\n                     \nThis strategic planning process is also unique in its attention to the Senate Resolution\n                        in support of unit planning for diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the\n                        planning process includes key campus constituents not represented in past planning.\n                        \n                     \nSan Diego State University\u2019s strategic planning process will include:\n\nA series of campus events and discussion groups tailored to main campus and Imperial\n                           Valley community members who are: students, faculty (including lecturers and University\n                           Senate members), staff, administrators, and representatives from the auxiliary units\n                           as well as alumni and community members.\n                        \nReview of the previous strategic plan and mission statement.\nRegular campus-wide communications, to include information and updates and opportunities\n                           for feedback.\n                        \nDevelopment and oversight of planning documents for the vision, mission, value statement\n                           and the eventual strategic plan, to include an implementation plan.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement of Community\nAs San Diego State University is re-imagining its mission and vision, the full participation\n                  of students, faculty and staff is critical. Every single university division, college\n                  and auxiliary must be involved in the process that will lead to the development of\n                  the university\u2019s strategic priorities.\n               \nThrough this process, we commit to open and transparent communications in line with\n                  our Shared Governance priorities, which serve to encourage responsibility, communication and respect. By\n                  extension, we agree to promote compassion, care, equity and civility through this\n                  process. It is important to recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating\n                  who we are individually, and what we contribute to our own departments and, overall,\n                  the university and extended community. Our differences and similarities will enrich\n                  our critical thoughts and conversations as we imagine the near future and beyond.\n               \nWe also will allow for respectful conflict to emerge over the course of this process,\n                  understanding that when we come together, we will make decisions fully aware of the\n                  issues and concerns.\n               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5500 Campanile DriveSan Diego, CA 92182\n619-594-5200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA-Z Index\n\n\nCampus Directory\n\n\nMaps\n\n\nParking\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment\n\n\nMedia Relations\n\n\nGive to SDSU\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Contact\n\n\nNetwork Status\n\n\nStrategic Plan\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright\u00a0\u00a9\u00a02023 San Diego State University\n\n\n\n\nRequires SDSUid\n indicates links which require an SDSUid.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nSDSU Digital Privacy Statement\n\n\nFeedback\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDocument Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Updated 7/8/21\n",
