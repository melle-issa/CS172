Among other things, the Clery Act requires all colleges and universities that participate in federal student aid programs to disclose information about specific campus policies, and to publish crime statistics reported to Campus Security Authorities that occur on specific campus geography. We invite you to browse this website to learn more about the Clery Act. You'll learn how Chico State complies with the regulations by ensuring that appropriate safety programs are in place, and that the campus community has access to relevant information to stay safe.Clery Act HistoryIn April of 1986, at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, a student named Jeanne Clery was raped and murdered in her dorm room. At that time, there was no requirement for universities to publish statistics about campus crime. Jeanne\u2019s parents, Connie and Howard Clery, lobbied Congress to pass legislation that would help provide information to current and prospective members of campus communities to aid them in making informed decisions about their safety. The Clery Act was signed into law in 1990 and has undergone numerous amendments since that time.\u201cThe best education in the world is useless if a student doesn't survive with a healthy body and mind.\u201d-Connie and Howard Clery\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jeanne Clery; photo provided by Clery CenterClery Center CollaborativeChico State partners with the Clery Center to improve our campus safety and compliance with Clery Act regulations.
