Stanford assumes that students understand and will honor this financial obligation. While the university acknowledges parents\u2019 and guardians\u2019 financial support, payment is the responsibility of the student. Students may authorize others to access their Stanford account and make payments on their behalf through Axess, the student database system.\nVisit the Student Financial Services website to learn more about such subjects as the University Bill, tuition insurance plans and tax information.\nFinancial Aid\nStanford has one of the strongest financial aid programs among U.S. colleges and universities.\nStanford\u2019s financial aid program is need-based, meaning that all aid eligibility is determined by a family\u2019s financial circumstances. While you and your students have the primary responsibility for paying for college, financial aid can bridge the gap between the total costs and the ability to pay.\nVisit the webpages of the Financial Aid Office. A special webpage has been designed especially for parents.\n \n\n\n\nStanford + Parents/Guardians\n The student is at the center \u2014 and is the focus \u2014 of this important partnership.\n\nOur Policy\nProspective Parents\n\n\n  \n\nParents' Helpline\n\nmykidis@stanford.edu\n650-725-0649\n \n\n\n  \n\nIn an Emergency\n\nemergency.stanford.edu\n650-725-5555\n 844-ALERTSU (844-253-7878)  \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Home\nMaps & Directions\nSearch Stanford\nEmergency Info\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy\nCopyright\nTrademarks\nNon-Discrimination\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University,  Stanford, California 94305.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n",
