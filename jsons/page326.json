The undergraduate balances work and school, work, procrastination, and mind blanks.\nTry to stay productive because undergrad is almost over. You\u2019ve almost made it! Wildfires swallow the surrounding communities. Sit and stare at articles for hours without processing a single thing.\nSit bare naked and exposed in front of the laptop screen. There\u2019s nothing to hide but no words to write. Barricaded by the barriers of a traumatized mind.\nWait and worry about those pre-requisites instead.\nLet the pain dissipate gradually.\nGraduate.\nThe virus hits right as the imposter syndrome was starting to subside. Second-semester spirals. Home becomes school becomes work which became a cage as we scramble searching for a separate space.\nThis is grad school\u2014keep up the momentum. You\u2019re a grad student\u2014keep up the momentum. This is grad school? This is your kitchen, your living room, and your cat who won\u2019t stop getting on top of the counter.\nSummer swells with the exhaustion of the last semester and the scattered sentences of a thesis yet to be written. Autumn comes. Those page counts need to be reached soon if those deadlines are to be kept.\nThose deadlines are being pushed back again.\nA flash-fiction collection concept. Pages that seem to add up with every editing attempt. Try to expand on this. Please provide further explanation for your reader. We need more context. More inner dialogue, please.\u00a0\nFluid short fiction flows from the fingertips with ease. A larger commitment comes with wordier literary works. Suddenly the piece has inner faucets that need tending to like those loose ends and pacing problems. You\u2019d better revise any problematic plot holes or faulty character arcs as well.\u00a0\nDiscussion Questions to Consider:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20031. Who\u2019s the killer of the story?\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20032. Which twists and turns are too trope-thick?\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20033. Is this influence-soaked work even yours anymore?\u00a0\u00a0\nPiles of papers containing comments keep the thoughts flowing but at too rampant of a pace. The revision process returns once again. Try to reestablish what the work was hoping to accomplish before being dissected. Is it still the same story? Is it successful? What does successful art look like?\nWait. Worry about what happens after all this and after your defense.\nGet it together and let these extra months be your saving grace.\nGraduate.\n\n \n\nMarch 2, 2022watershedcsuc\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nWR Intern Spotlight: A Charge of First-Degree Writing: Almost Objective Notes from a Slush\u00a0Reader \n\nBy Morgan Konefal\nTwenty chapbook manuscripts. Hundreds of poems. Hours reviewing, pitching, and selecting pieces to share with a world. As an editor, this is the delicious bread and butter sprinkled with inspiration and cheddar cheese, lots of cheddar cheese. And believe it or not, depending on your astute knowledge of the enigmas of the publishing world, us editors are writers as well.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs verbally inclined artists, we are plagued (or blessed depending on your state of being) with a need to give a fraction of our jotted-down soul to anyone willing to hold it. Books. Zines. Facebook posts. A message in a bottle. Bathroom graffiti. A mother\u2019s day card that only one person in the entire world willingly wants to read.\u00a0\nMost importantly (and subjective to both you and me) are the beautiful forms of poetry and the literature that falls under the umbrella term \u201cshort stories\u201d. And as an editor, I am often asked by invisible and imaginary enthusiastic submitters: \u201cHow do I go from hopeful applicant to slapping Take That, Doubters! onto my list of published praised places?\u201d My answer? Maximum effort. Purpose. Passion. Think you\u2019ve got all the ingredients mixed without lumps or an accidental addition of Chemical X? Look into the mirror and interrogate your reflection with the following script before pushing the \u201csubmit\u201d button.\u00a0\n\u2003\u2003Why are you submitting? \n\u2003\u2003To get published. \n\u2003\u2003Don\u2019t we all?\n\u2003\u2003I want to get published so I can go on and on and on and on and on and on \u2003\u2003about it at the office Christmas party.\n\u2003\u2003Wrong.\n\u2003\u2003Why is this poem going first in the collection? \n\u2003\u2003It\u2019s the titular piece.\n\u2003\u2003Is it the strongest one?\n\u2003\u2003No.\n\u2003\u2003Wrong.\n\u2003\u2003Why does this character need to die?\n\u2003\u2003Because I hate my mother-in-law.\n\u2003\u2003But does it complicate the story? Does it produce that sweet, sweet nectar of \u2003\u2003character development? Is there a lesson learned at her expense? Will the \u2003\u2003reader be impacted? Think hard about it.\n\u2003\u2003You mean is this only a way to force my readers to live out a fantasy that is \u2003\u2003concerning as it is cliche? \n\u2003\u2003Yes. \n\u2003\u2003Yes. \n\u2003\u2003Wrong.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003Why\t\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003are\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003the\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003words \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003placed\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003this \n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003way?\n\u2003\u2003It\u2019s a poetic, artistic choice.\n\u2003\u2003Yes, but does the form make sense with the message? Are the white spaces a \u2003\u2003way to denote the slowly melting polar regions in a poem about poisons \u2003\u2003pouring into the elements? Are alignments given to show the divide between \u2003\u2003two lovers as they realize their whirlwind relationship truly should stay in \u2003\u2003Vegas? \n\u2003\u2003No, it just looks cool.\n\u2003\u2003Wrong.\n\u2003\u2003Did Grammarly correct all your grammar mistakes for you?\n\u2003\u2003Mayb.\n\u2003\u2003Wrong.\nIs this really a piece containing an idiosyncratic, beautiful voice that sings lyrics to awaken the soul of a nonbeliever? Did you really spend hours and hours rehearsing it before declaring it could not possibly have a higher potential for greatness? You\u2019re really auditioning this work of magnificence because it means something to you and you hope it can to others?\nYes.\nCongratulations, you\u2019ve been selected for this edition of _______.\n\n\n \n\nMarch 2, 2022watershedcsuc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll\n\nDiscuss\nGet Inspired\nGet Polling\nGet Support\nLearn WordPress.com\nTheme Showcase\nWordPress Planet\nWordPress.com News\n\n\nTopics\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nUpcoming Events No upcoming events\nArchives\n\nMay 2022\nMarch 2022\nMay 2020\nOctober 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nOctober 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nApril 2017\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nDecember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nApril 2014\nFebruary 2014\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nAugust 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\n\n \n\nFollow me on TwitterMy Tweets \n\n\n\n\nCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
