Courtesy of Annie MeederMeeder plans to continue researching in this field and to pursue a doctorate on island vegetation communities and their response to historical, current, and future disturbances. She hopes her research can be used as a model for assessing vegetation dynamics and management strategies in both island systems and mainland areas where vegetation has undergone alteration from overgrazing \u2014 and that work can be used to help predict island vegetation response to climate change.\n\u201cMy first exposure to ecology and science was in high school on a trip to Santa Cruz Island doing volunteer research,\u201d Meeder said. \u201cI now help lead those trips and mentor high schoolers. As a researcher on Santa Cruz Island, I have had an incredible opportunity with Dr. Yost to just collect awesome data, do meaningful work, and give Cal Poly students and faculty alike an incredible research experience.\u201d\nSavannah Weaver, a second-year graduate student from San Jos\u00e9, plans to continue to study the water balance of reptiles, specifically how water requirements and water-conserving adaptations vary over time and among species and different habitats.\nSavannah Weaver holds up a lizard while out in the field. Brittany App\u201cAs the climate crisis continues and drought and heatwaves become more frequent and intense, understanding the water requirements of reptiles, and all animals, will be essential for conservation management,\u201d she said.\nWeaver has studied the abundant Western Fence Lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis) under the mentorship of Emily Taylor, professor in the Biological Science Department. Weaver hopes to study other lizards and snakes in her doctoral program.\n\u200b\u201cI've always loved nature, and I\u2019ve become increasingly passionate about the conservation of wildlife and wild landscapes,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cWhen I started graduate school with Dr. Taylor, I realized that very little was known about reptile water balance, despite its importance. I read everything I could about it and was immediately hooked, because there was so much information that I felt was missing and that I could try to figure out.\u201d\nTwo Cal Poly alumni, Gabriel Medina-Kim (Computer Science, \u201920) and Nicole Siguenza (Biochemistry and Microbiology, '20) were also awarded fellowships.\nMedina-Kim is in the second year of the doctoral program in science and technology studies at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. He was previously selected for the CSU Chancellor\u2019s Doctoral Incentive Program, a program to support the development of future faculty and support doctoral education. Siguenza is in her second year at UC San Diego, pursuing a doctorate in biomedical sciences.\n\u201cI am thrilled to see our students and alumni be recognized for their outstanding work in their fields and receive support from the NSF to continue that work,\u201d said Bob Crockett, Cal Poly\u2019s administrator in charge of Research, Economic Development and Graduate Education. \u201cThese students are tremendous examples of what can be done at Cal Poly when our students and faculty can collaborate.\u201d\nThe NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students in NSF-supported science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines who are pursuing research-based master\u2019s and doctoral degrees at accredited U.S. institutions.\nFellowships provide students with a three-year annual stipend of $34,000 along with a $12,000 cost of education allowance for tuition and fees, as well as access to opportunities for professional development available to NSF-supported graduate students.\nWant more Learn by Doing stories in your life?
