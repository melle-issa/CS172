It took nearly a decade for this vision to become a reality, but in 1879 Widney formed a board of trustees and secured a donation of 308 lots of land from three prominent members of the community \u2013 Ozro W. Childs, a Protestant horticulturist; former California governor John G. Downey, an Irish-Catholic pharmacist and businessman; and Isaias W. Hellman, a German-Jewish banker and philanthropist. The gift provided land for a campus as well as a source of endowment, the seeds of financial support for the nascent institution.\nWhen USC first opened its doors to 53 students and 10 teachers in 1880, the \u201ccity\u201d still lacked paved streets, electric lights, telephones and a reliable fire alarm system. Today, USC is home to more than 48,000 students and over 4,400 full-time faculty, and is located in the heart of one of the biggest metropolises in the world.\n\n \nIn this section \nHistory\nThe Era of the Founders\nGallery of USC Presidents\nUSC\u2019s Olympic Heritage\n\nTrojan Olympic Gallery\n\n\nUSC\u2019s Commencement History\n\nPast Speakers and Honorary Degree Recipients\nUniversity Marshal\n\n\nTradition of Support for the Armed Forces\n \n\n\n\nTimeline\n\n2020s++2021: President Carol L.
