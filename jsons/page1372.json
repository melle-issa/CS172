To properly join the fun, please head to #fse-outreach-experiment in Make Slack for future testing announcements, helpful posts, and more will be shared there.\u00a0\nOverview\nWhile the release of 6.2 brought loads of new features to the site editing experience, feature development has continued in the GutenbergGutenberg The Gutenberg project is the new Editor Interface for WordPress. The editor improves the process and experience of creating new content, making writing rich content much simpler. It uses \u2018blocks\u2019 to add richness rather than shortcodes, custom HTML etc. https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/ pluginPlugin A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party, leaving us with the next lineup of cutting edge features to test and refine. This includes looping back on the new navigation section that was removed for WordPress 6.2. The aim of this call for testing is to both get feedback on what\u2019s landed in 6.2 in the pursuit of continuous iteration and to dig into what\u2019s being worked on for the remainder of phase 2 items including:\nPatterns in template creation.\nExperimental Grid Layout.\nAs always, these calls for testing will also explore current features that have been staples since the beginning of the introduction of the site editor, like the Navigation blockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. or Template Part blocks.\u00a0\nFraming\nYou run a site that captures \u201cDaily Delights\u201d about the power of everyday moments to create joy. You want to create a new front page of your site that\u2019s more colorful to reflect the nature of your content. When you chose your theme, you knew it came with a few front page options thanks to patterns so you decided to check out what\u2019s possible. Once you have a new front page option in place, you decide to make some additional changes to your template and navigation to better personalize this new experience of your site.\nTesting Instructions\u00a0\nTo use a prebuilt test site:\u00a0\nOpen this link only once: https://app.instawp.io/launch?t=fse-call-for-testing-21&d=v1\u00a0\nPlease do not repeatedly open this link as it creates a new site each time and there\u2019s a limit of 50 sites that can be created.\u00a0\nThis will launch a site for you to use for up to 24 hours. Select \u201cMagic Login\u201d to log in to the wp-admin dashboard.\u00a0\nSave the link to your site so you can access it again during the test.\u00a0\nTo set up your own test site:\u00a0\nHave a test site using the latest version of WordPress. It\u2019s important this is not a production/live site.\u00a0\nInstall and activate the Twenty Twenty Three One by going to Appearances > Themes.\nInstall and activate Gutenberg 15.5.1. From there, head to Gutenberg > Experiments and turn on the Grid variation for Group block experiment.\nHead to Tools > Import and import this file to have access to the same content as above. From there, create a simple menu and add a few widgets.\u00a0\nIf you have any issues with manual setup, just comment on the post or pingPing The act of sending a very small amount of data to an end point.  Ping is used in computer science to illicit a response from a target server to test it\u2019s connection. Ping is also a term used by Slack users to @ someone or send them a direct message (DM).

Click through a few of the templates to get a feel for your site and notice how a preview is shown of each template when you do so. To go back to view all templates, select the > arrow.\u00a0\nClick the + next to Templates in the dark gray sidebarSidebar A sidebar in WordPress is referred to a widget-ready area used by WordPress themes to display information that is not a part of the main content. It is not always a vertical column on the side. It can be a horizontal rectangle below or above the content area, footer, header, or any where in the theme. and select \u201cFront Page\u201d.\u00a0\nThis will open up a modal where you can choose between different patterns to begin building your template. Select the second pattern with various green colors depicted. This will bring you to the Front Page template with that pattern inserted automatically.\nUse the Grid layout\nUsing List View, select the second Group block that contains the Query LoopLoop The Loop is PHP code used by WordPress to display posts. Using The Loop, WordPress processes each post to be displayed on the current page, and formats it according to how it matches specified criteria within The Loop tags. Any HTML or PHP code in the Loop will be processed on each post. https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop. block.\u00a0\nOpen the block settings and choose to transform it to a Grid layout. Here\u2019s a visual.\nAfter doing so, under Layout in block settings, change around the values of MINIMUM COLUMN WIDTH until you like how it looks.\u00a0\nUnderneath this Group block, add an additional Grid group block variation by either directly searching for \u201cGrid\u201d or adding a Group block and selecting the Grid variation.\nExplore using this block. This is intentionally an open ended item to encourage you to explore what this experimental block can do. For example, you could add a section of images or different sections of Headings and paragraph blocks grouped within a Grid block or a section of hashtags you want folks to use. Here\u2019s an example of this last item.\nSave changes.\u00a0\nCreate a new page (or pages) for navigation\u00a0\nSelect the Navigation Block in your headerHeader The header of your site is typically the first thing people will experience.

It may also look different on different screen sizes. and select the option to \u201cEdit\u201d converting your menu to individual blocks.\u00a0\nAdd a new item to the menu by clicking the + button in the editor itself (not in the settings sidebar).\nInstead of adding a current page, search for \u201cInspiration\u201d and notice the option to create a draft page with that title. Select that option.\nCreate as many draft pages as you\u2019d like using the same process.\nAdd a search block to your menu and customize it.\nSave changes.\nManage your navigation and explore your pages\nSelect the WordPress icon to open up the dark gray sidebar and use the > arrows to go back to the overall Design section.\nNotice there is now a Navigation section. Select it and rearrange your menu items from there.\u00a0\nSelect a page in your menu and notice that you can edit it directly either by clicking on the canvas or selecting the pencil icon in the sidebar. Make changes to this page and don\u2019t save in the editor.\u00a0\nInstead select the WordPress icon to open up the dark gray sidebar and notice a Save option in the sidebar itself.\u00a0\nSelect the save option there and select Save again from the modal.\u00a0\nRepeat this process with another page in your menu, saving where you\u2019d like.\u00a0\nWhen done, go back to wp-admin > Pages and publish your pages to ensure they appear correctly in the navigation of your site.\nWhat to notice:\nDid the experience crash at any point?\nDid the saving experience work properly?\u00a0\nWhat did you find particularly confusing or frustrating about the experience?\nWhat did you especially enjoy or appreciate about the experience?\u00a0\nWhat would have made this experience easier?\nDid you find that what you created matched what you saw on your site?\nDid it work using Keyboard only?\nDid it work using a screen reader?\nDid it work while using just a mobile device?

Thank you to everyone who joined in!\nAttendance:\n@elblakeo31\u00a0@beckej @annezazu @paaljoachim @rbest Lauren Gray, @FahimMurshed, James Riordon, Micro.\nVideo Recording:\n\n\nNotes:\nIntroduction\nWe kicked off the call with an introduction from @elblakeo31, a member of the FSE Outreach Program who has long been seeking to use the latest and greatest as soon and as much as possible. As an early adopter himself, part of his work is helping people adopt new technology too. \n\nClients are now reaching out to me about FSE features and want to use it. We\u2019re starting to see a transition from people being very wary to really wanting to use the CoreCore Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress. features that WordPress has offered.\n@elblakeo31\u00a0\nGeneral Approach\nThey have had seven different sites moving to the Site Editor in production. They are purposefully not trying to create themes for these projects and are trying to use as much of the site editor as possible. Currently, they are using child themes for some of the projects but mostly just taking Twenty Twenty-Three and using that outright. Blake sees a huge advantage in using the Site Editor directly as a design tool rather than using figma before replicating in WordPress. There are some challenges here in that folks are used to Figma and the Site Editor has a learning curve, along with some limitations (like a more dynamic navigation experience). Alongside this, a lot of work is done to evaluate what plugins are needed on a site and to ensure whatever they might want to use has support within the Site Editor. Generally speaking, they try not to build that many custom blocks and instead rely on patterns with an emphasis on employing as much as possible from the curating the editor experience doc. This is especially true with larger organizations, like a big university, where they need to lock things down more.\u00a0\nWhat does a web agency look like in a site editor universe? \nHow can we provide services when clients can do so much on their own with the Site Editor? This naturally came up as a point of conversation with Blake sharing how he aims to train clients to use the site editor capabilities and how \u201ca lot of time spent developing is now spent on teaching\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe biggest challenge right now is teaching people a new tool. Coming into GutenbergGutenberg The Gutenberg project is the new Editor Interface for WordPress. The editor improves the process and experience of creating new content, making writing rich content much simpler. It uses \u2018blocks\u2019 to add richness rather than shortcodes, custom HTML etc. https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/, there\u2019s already some \u201ctrepidation and anger\u201d from folks at times. Whatever size website a client is working with them on, if they\u2019ve used WordPress before, they are a bit feature fatigued. To help combat this and bring them into the future, they spend a lot of time bringing them into a culture of collaboration and experimentation which folks don\u2019t normally want. As a result, they specifically choose clients who appreciate some level of experimentation that comes with adopting new tech. \n\nRight now with the latest release, we\u2019re at a point where I can bring projects into production and feel confident that they\u2019ll stick.\n@elblakeo31\u00a0\nWhen are you deciding to use a child themeChild theme A Child Theme is a customized theme based upon a Parent Theme. It\u2019s considered best practice to create a child theme if you want to modify the CSS of your theme. https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/child-themes/. vs TT3? What drives that decision?\u00a0\nBlake shared that he has talked to a lot of folks around best practices and aims to do as much as possible in the editor. He knows too that he\u2019ll get more support from the community if he\u2019s pushing the limits of Twenty Twenty Three than another theme. As he\u2019s digging in, he\u2019ll also document anywhere code is added to keep up to date with what might change in the future. Fonts is a great example of this and comes up a lot. In the future, fonts will be managed more directly in Core but, currently, they are using the Create BlockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. Theme pluginPlugin A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party to handle. \nWhat process do you follow for using the site editor directly as a design tool vs figma?\u00a0\nSince the early days of using a WYSIWYGWhat You See Is What You Get What You See Is What You Get. Most commonly used in relation to editors, where changes made in edit mode reflect exactly as they will translate to the published page. editor, Blake has dreamed of not using anything except an editor to mock things up and to cut out needing to use things like Adobe. It feels like a waste of time to have multiple sources of truth when it could all be in a single editor. In terms or process for this, they\u2019ll follow something like the following:\nAdd content into WordPress using Twenty Twenty-Three with no style changes. \nAdd in some style elements with the site editor and explain various style pieces to a client directly, alongside options they have going forward depending on what they want to do. \nBuild anything custom, like custom elements or adding plugins to improve the accessibilityAccessibility Accessibility (commonly shortened to a11y) refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. The concept of accessible design ensures both \u201cdirect access\u201d (i.e. unassisted) and \u201cindirect access\u201d meaning compatibility with a person\u2019s assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers). (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility) of sites. \nIn the 7-8 sites using site editor, they haven\u2019t gotten to a point where a client says this won\u2019t work for me. Because they have not done any mockups, they\u2019ve ended up literally leading them through with the Site Editor. Metering client expectations is one of the biggest tools for the trade as a result: \u201cThere\u2019s this new technology that will position you better in the future but there are limits at the same time.\u201d\n\nI can relate to everything Blake is speaking on. I\u2019m only an agency of one, but I follow the exact same approach for all\u00a0 my builds, including using TT3 as a base, or the Frost them from Brian Gardner. I mockup in the site editor. Collaboration is via a P2P2 P2 or O2 is the term people use to refer to the Make WordPress blog. It can be found at https://make.wordpress.org/. or a communication page I\u2019ll make, as this gives the clients easy opportunities to work with blocks and get comfortable.\nMicro in the chat of the zoom\nWhat kinds of clients do you work with and how does your approach change depending?\nIn general, there are three kinds of clients:\nCreate something from a template: Someone comes with a full design mock up saying they want X. This is becoming more and more rare as their agency is known to create things from scratch. Often times take a design and use either a custom block or an HTMLHTML HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a markup language that is used in the development of web pages and websites. block if they want a pixel perfect match. \nSmall build out: Wants a website designed and built from scratch that isn\u2019t a large organization. They\u2019ll work with folks to get all the content into WordPress. Set up 1-3 hour calls to talk about content, look at different WP sites, and see what the client wants to do (drop it in a google doc or wants to get into the WP editor right away). Then have a meeting that\u2019s more design focused to emphasize and create patterns, find sites they like, etc. That iteration process then just continues.\u00a0\nBig organization like a university. At this level, focus more on features and act as almost consultants working alongside an IT team that\u2019s aware of WP. For larger orgs, it\u2019s whatever they want. Recently, built 80% of the site then did a teaching piece and eventually will do a finishing piece. For other orgs, it\u2019s more about giving lessons and guidance on how to use it to employ best practices. These can often take longer.\u00a0\nOn the education piece, a lot of time is spent getting folks comfortable with the editor, including designers. Having folks get comfortable with site editor, including designers. Each block has different controls, etc. once you have some of that in place, can have folks go wild.\u00a0Blake shared how he tries to get folks to think about being designers themselves of the block editor and thinking about blocks as the fundamental level of a design. \nWhat clicked to make you feel confident in using the site editor in production?\nAnother attendees asked this and Blake shared how every time there\u2019s a new release, he spends a ton of his own time testing things. Often times, he\u2019ll spend a weekend seeing if he can get a project to work in the Site Editor and share it ahead of time for a client to see if it will then work for them. He\u2019s finding increasingly that things are working and he can just give things to the client. With the latest release, he has always moved away from using the Gutenberg plugin as a stop gap (\u201cIt\u2019s been liberating to move away from that\u201d). \nOther\nWe talked through some aspects of maintenance, the broader adoption of the Site Editor within the WordPress community, and looked to the future with a few GitHubGitHub GitHub is a website that offers online implementation of git repositories that can easily be shared, copied and modified by other developers. Public repositories are free to host, private repositories require a paid subscription. GitHub introduced the concept of the \u2018pull request\u2019 where code changes done in branches by contributors can be reviewed and discussed before being merged be the repository owner.  https://github.com/ issues. This include a more in depth discussion around template parts, patterns, and reusable blocks with a look at a recent discussion on ways to unify. \nResources shared:\nThe following documentation was shared:\n\nCurating the Editor Experience\n\nTools & Resources\n\n@wordpress/create-block\n\nPropagating updates for block types\nThe following GitHub links were shared:\nVIP\u2019s design system bridge repo that contains a tool making it easy to sync figma design system values with theme.jsonJSON JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a minimal, readable format for structuring data.
