In light of this change, as well as current guidance from the CDC, CDPH and Cal/OSHA, President\u2019s Directive No. 22 will no longer be in effect as of April 17, 2023.\nAll university employees who test positive for COVID-19, have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive, or are experiencing symptoms they believe are related to COVID-19 are strongly encouraged to submit a\u00a0COVID-19 Self-Reporting Form. No members of the university community should come to any university property or participate in any university-related activity if they are experiencing symptoms they believe are related to COVID-19. In addition, campus community members who develop symptoms they believe are related to COVID-19 while on University property or participating in any University-related activity should leave campus or remove themselves from the activity.\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n Report Case, Exposure, or Test Results\nCOVID-19 self-reporting form\n\n\n\n\n\n Case Counts & Exposures\nExposure locations and weekly case counts\n\n\n\n\n\n Testing & Vaccinations\nTesting, vaccine policy and exemption information\n\n\n\n\n\n Safety Protocols\nCOVID-19 safety protocols, resources and PPE\n\n\n\n\n\n For Students\nInformation for prospective and current students\n\n\n\n\n\n For Employees\nInformation and resources from HRDI\n\n\n\n\nLatest Updates & Messages\n\nMonday April 17, 2023\nPresidential Directive 22 expired on April 17, 2023.\n\n\n\nThursday September 15, 2022\n[Expired on 4/17/23] Presidential Directive 22: COVID-19 Mitigation Measures and Guidelines\n\n\n\n\nThursday March 17, 2022\nHRDI Email to Employees: Face Coverings and Testing\n\n\n\n\nWednesday February 16, 2022\nPresident\u2019s Directive 22: Indoor Face Covering Extended\n\n\n\n\nFriday February 11, 2022\nFace Covering Policy Reminder \u2013 In place until Feb. 28\n\n \n\n\nPersonal Health Assessment\nPrior to arriving on any University property or participating in any University-related activity, please\u00a0complete a personal health assessment for possible COVID-19 related symptoms.\n\nView Personal Health Assessment\n\n\n\nCares Act\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided funding to higher education institutions.\n\nView CARES Act Information\n\n\n\nOn Campus Event/Activity Approval Request\n\nSubmit Event Request\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          This site is maintained by University Advancement.\n          To report problems or comments with this site, please contact stratcomm@fullerton.edu.\n          \u00a9 California State University, Fullerton.
