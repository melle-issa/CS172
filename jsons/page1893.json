If you\u2019re of a certain age, you saw this when it was broadcast, or if you\u2019re slightly younger, you saw it on reruns on Saturday mornings, or you might even have come across the 1990s remake, which I haven\u2019t watched yet. Anyway, the theme song was great. [\u2026]\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblogging\n\nMixed feelings Clearing Out my Feeds \n\nI started to use Netnewswire in the last few months. I didn\u2019t do much with it until a few weeks ago when Feedly made the headlines about their AI protest control thing. I learned they have an exporter so I exported the OPML file of my feeds and there were [\u2026]\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTech\n\nChatGPT wrote a script \n\nIf you ask ChatGPT to write a script to do some computer operation, it will. It will write an actual script with an actor and narrator and then add a Python script to do what you wanted in the middle of it. [INT.

The creator of the film, Devon Avery, uploaded it to his own channel last month, and I think it\u2019s worth another [\u2026]\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndemoscene\n\nTry the tiny 8bit emulators in your browser \n\nEven if you\u2019ve never been curious about what computers in the 80s looked like, you might like to see all the emulators on this page. Multiple computers are covered here, including the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, the Spectrum 48K and a few others I\u2019ve never heard of. The nice thing [\u2026]\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMovies\n\nThe miniatures of The Fifth Element \n\nThe Fifth Element is a great movie. One of my favourites. Here\u2019s a video about the miniatures used. Apparently lots of the people they hired to build the sets never worked in that business again. Everything went digital\u2026 And now? Would you ask Midjourney to create the set for you?\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\nThree years ago the schools closed \n\nI was reminded by this Reddit thread that it was three years ago today that schools closed in Ireland because of a new virus that caused an illness called COVID-19. Later that week I started posting some of the news here in a series of blog posts. It didn\u2019t last [\u2026]\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic\n\nOpen Cubic Player and Mods \n\nOh dear. This will be so niche that nobody is going to read. Anyway. Long before MP3 files were a thing, the world had mod files. It had s3m, xm, and it music files. There was a thriving scene of musicians creating music for the love of it.

Despite their potential, I rarely use them, leading to some forgetfulness about configuring their wireless transmitters. A helpful YouTube video brought back memories of the necessary [\u2026]\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotography\n\nUh oh. Is adobeyourshotyourstory.com gone astray? \n\nThis morning I saw a notification on the Adobe \u201cCreative Cloud\u201d app I can get pro tips for photographing people\u2026. etc etc. I thought it was the usual material Adobe brings out, which to be fair, is quite good, so I clicked it.

The races started at 2 pm and continued until 4.30 pm, and I went with some of my buddies from the Blarney Photography Club. We positioned ourselves near the second last jump, and it was a super fun day filled [\u2026](no title)April 30, 2023 Avoid Ballydehob on the jazz weekend there. Parked cars along the road for as far as the eye can see today. Never, ever saw it so busy!(no title)April 30, 2023 As I strolled towards our apartment, the tantalizing aroma of Spanish cuisine filled the air. My eyes scanned the street and landed on a cosy restaurant, where the lively chatter of people enjoying their meals echoed through the evening air. Among them, I spotted a couple fully engrossed in a deep conversation, savouring the last [\u2026](no title)April 30, 2023 Jane Fonda is amazing.https://pca.st/episode/3feca9f7-ddc0-48e5-98ba-c6ec50f5e9e7#JaneFonda #podcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tTheme Fourteen Blog by Kantipur Themes \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy continuing to use the site, you agree to the use of cookies. more information AcceptThe cookie settings on this website are set to \"allow cookies\" to give you the best browsing experience possible.
