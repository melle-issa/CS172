Cal State Apply assists students in planning for college, in selecting the appropriate CSU campus to attend, in planning how to finance their education, and in applying for admission.\nCal State Apply is free to use. The student will only pay the application fee charged by the CSU campus when an application for admission is submitted. All personal data entered by the user is not released without the user's express consent, and data entered in a planner can be transferred easily to an online application for admission.\nQuick Links\n\n\n\n\n\nCal State Apply\n\u00a0\n\nCal State Apply Tutorial\n\u00a0\n\nMeet Our Program Admissions Advisors\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nApplication Support Workshop\nAre you struggling to complete your application for a College of Education program on the CAL STATE APPLY website?\u00a0 Attend a workshop to learn shortcuts to expedite your application process and receive support.\u00a0 Workshop attendees will log in to their CAL STATE APPLY applications and College of Education staff will help with challenges you may be experiencing.\u00a0\nAPPLICANTS MUST ATTEND AN INFORMATION SESSION PRIOR TO REGISTERING FOR A WORKSHOP.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nCredential Programs\n\n\n\n    There are no scheduled upcoming events at this time.\n        \n\n  \n\n\n\n\nMasters Program\n\n\n\n    There are no scheduled upcoming events at this time.\n        \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight Content\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n May 2\n\n\nMA in STEM Education Information Session\n\n 3:00pm - 4:30pm\n Zoom Meeting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n May 2\n\n\nMath & Science Single Subject Information Session\n\n 3:00pm - 4:30pm\n Zoom Meeting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n May 3\n\n\nMultiple Subject Information Session\n\n 3:00pm - 4:30pm\n Zoom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n May 3\n\n\nMA in Instructional Design and Technology Information Session\n\n 4:00pm - 5:00pm\n https://csusb.zoom.us/j/83966552977\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive to COE\nApply Now\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege of Education - Office of the Dean\n\n\n\nPhone Number (909) 537-5600 \n\n\n\nLocation:CE-221\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\n\nMonday - Friday: \n 8:00 am - 5:00 pm\n\n\n\n\nSaturday - Sunday: \n Closed\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Services\nOffice: CE-102\nPhone: (909) 537-5609\nEducational Leadership & Technology\nOffice: CE-374\nPhone: (909) 537-7404\nSpecial Education, Rehabilitation & Counseling\nOffice: CE-243\nPhone: (909) 537-5606\nTeacher Education & Foundations\nLocation: CE-261\nPhone: (909) 537-7405\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media\n\n\n\nCollege of Education Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege of Education Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege of Education Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege of Education LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Region\n\n\n\nCSUSB\n\n\nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino\n5500 University Parkway\nSan Bernardino, CA 92407\n+1 (909) 537-5000\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Social Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso of InterestSan Bernardino University Office of AdmissionsSan Bernardino University AdmissionApplication \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1 \n\n\n\n\nLogin\n\n\n\n\nmyCoyote\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\nStudent Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB  \nDrupal Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Interest to...\n\n\n\n\nFuture Students\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Students\n   Interests\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nFull-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nPart-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & Visitors\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nAlumni & Friends\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Partners\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nMilitary/Veterans\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 2 \n\n\n\n\nEmployment\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB \nJob Listings\n - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nFaculty Jobs\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nCareer Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHuman Resources\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Employment\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nContact\n  CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nClery Act\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Safety Reports\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTitle IX Notice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure of Consumer Information\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 3 \n\n\n\n\nCampus Services\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Advising\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHousing & Residential Life\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nOmbuds Services\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nParking\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPolice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPsychological Counseling\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nServices to Students with Disabilities\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Health Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Support\n\n\n\n\nTranscripts\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\n\n\n\nNon-Discrimination Notice\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Copyright/DMCA Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
