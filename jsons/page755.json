It was during a spring semester performance of the Mariachi Panteras.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was during the last song of the mariachi concert. I could see people in the audience and a lot of them were crying,\u201d she says.\u00a0\nShe found out why after the concert. \u201cMany of them went to Chapman and never actually felt like they connected here, because of their Latino heritage. This was the first time that they felt seen as Hispanic people at Chapman,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was very touching because I was able to be a part of the creation of the ensemble, and I was able to lead it. I\u2019m glad that I saw that people who had been at Chapman years ago were able to come back and that there\u2019s this community here at Chapman for Latinos.\u201d\nSanchez leads a Mariachi Panteras practice session in Chapman\u2019s Hall-Musco Conservatory of Music. (Photo by Mark Arditi)\nSanchez, who started playing music when she was just four years old, was instrumental in establishing the mariachi ensemble during her time at Chapman. Though her primary instrument is saxophone, the performance and music education major also plays violin, harp, saxophone, piano and clarinet, plus the guitarr\u00f3n and vihuela \u2014 specialized guitars used to play mariachi music. She also sings.\u00a0\nHer passion for mariachi has deep roots.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was something that I knew from a very young age. It\u2019s obviously something that connects to my culture, and my parents, so that always brought us together as a family. And it also made us connect with other families like mine, and other friends that I had met later in school as well. If it weren\u2019t for mariachi, I actually probably wouldn\u2019t have entered the band program in junior high and then continued it in high school,\u201d she says.\nAfter years of performing mariachi with her family, it seemed natural to major in performance when she started college. Along the way, she realized that teaching music could be fun, too.\u00a0\n\u201cI had experience being a class leader and section leader and things like that. I decided that I wanted to do more, and that it would be a great career,\u201d she says.\nAfter graduation, Sanchez will continue at Chapman to earn her teaching credential and Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) Music Education.\nRead more about Chapman University\u2019s Class of 2022.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nalumni news class of 2022 commencement Commencement 2022 features Hall-Musco Conservatory of Music mariachi panteras music education \n\n\n\n\n \n\nStaci Dumoski \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAraceli Martinez Named Executive Director of Chapman\u2019s Cross-Cultural Center and First-Generation Programs\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman University Celebrates Honorary Degree Recipients During 2022 Commencement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle Tanimura \u201923: Leadership That Spans the Campus Jack of all trades Kyle Tanimura is leaving quite the lasting mark on Chapman, where he has taken on multiple leadership roles as a double major in political science and strategic and corporate communication, with a...\n\n\nMay 1, 2023 Jennifer Winfield\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Pacific Islander Desi American Heritage Month Events at Chapman University Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Heritage Month, which runs from May 1 to 31, celebrates the identities, histories and experiences of the APIDA community.
