She was 94.\nAllred grew her business, Pool Water Products, from a $500 starter loan to the largest woman-owned business in Orange County. She was generous in her support of Chapman, including by funding the Olympic-quality Allred Aquatics Center. In 2009, Chapman awarded an honorary doctorate to Allred, who had left college to raise her two sons.\n\u201cZee exemplified leadership in all its forms and undeniably saw everyone at Chapman as family,\u201d said Chapman President Daniele C. Struppa.\nPool Water Products, headquartered in Irvine, expanded into four other states. The Orange County Business Journal, when awarding Allred its Women in Business Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014, said she grew the company \u201cwhile nurturing a family, thereby raising the glass ceiling for women in all workplaces and setting a meaningful example for those who face difficult decisions regarding the balance between family responsibilities and professional life.\u201d\nZee was also an equal partner in two companies, Pentagon A Investments and Aqua Tri.\nHer community involvement was just as impactful as her professional life. Allred was appointed to Chapman\u2019s Board of Trustees in 1989, and was active in Women of Chapman and Town & Gown. In addition to athletics, she supported Fish Interfaith Center, Leatherby Libraries. Chapman Celebrates and Economic Forecast.\n\u201cZee\u2019s amazing entrepreneurial ability built a business powerhouse,\u201d said Chapman President Emeritus Jim Doti. \u201cMore importantly, she used that success to transform our university and community.\u201d\nAllred served on other boards, including Segerstrom Center for the Arts. She supported the Assessment and Treatment Services Center, UCI Medical Research and Education Society, Bowers Museum, Pacific Symphony, South Coast Repertory, Orange County Trauma Society, Orange County Philharmonic Society and other community organizations.\n\u201cI\u2019ve made a good living in Orange County,\u201d she told Pool and Spa News. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me to give back to the community that\u2019s given me so much.\u201d\nAllred is survived by her children Vern, Dean and Carol Ann, 16 grandchildren \u2013 who include Chapman alumni \u2013 and her companion, Drago Gligic.\n\n\nAllred Board of Trustees Chapman University Board of Trustees Women in Business \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJoy Juedes \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw Students Negotiate Their Way to Dubai\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Memoriam: Beverly Weatherill \u201950\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumna Implements Sustainability at Happiest Place on Earth A Chapman University alumna is helping Disneyland Resort meet its ambitious goal of sending zero waste to landfills by 2030.
