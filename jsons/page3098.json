It can be seen as somewhat complementing\u00a0https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/04/05/wordpress-6-2-performance-improvements-for-all-themes/, at a higher level however without looking as much at specific improvements.\nDiscussion regarding the\u00a0decoupling of the SQLite pluginPlugin A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party\u00a0from the performance lab work. In reference to\u00a0this conversation that came up in a previous performance chat. Would love to have an open discussion about peoples preferences here and whether we do decouple this?\n@olliejones I favor that approach. It will usually be deployedDeploy Launching code from a local development environment to the production web server, so that it's available to visitors. independently of the stuff in PL.\n@10upsimon I tend to lean more toward an agreement with\u00a0@rmccue in that SQLite is not necessarily performance improvements focused (or at least that is not the primary goal), and probably belongs outside of the realm of the performance lab work.\n@spacedmonkey To be clear, I think that performance team should continue to support SQlite getting into coreCore Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress., to much sure it done in a performant way. But SQlite is not a performance benefit on the face of it, so it is confusing why we part of performance lab plugin.\n@rmccue Yeah, that was basically my thought; I think it\u2019s beneficial all-round to separate it out (but with performance still consulting as @spacedmonkey says)\n@olliejones yes, having SQLite headed for core is good. I believe the issue is about monorepo and multifunction plugins on the one hand and a separate repo and plugin on the other.\n@aristath I agree with what was mentioned above 100%. SQLite\u00a0can\u00a0be related to performance, but is not in itself a \u201cperformance\u201d module/plugin. It should be developed in collaboration with the performance team since it can have a big impact, but I\u2019d vote to decouple it from the performance-lab plugin\n@olliejones Maybe in a parallel universe or another year, there can be a separate database team. But for now the perf. team has the talent.\n@spacedmonkey If you want to setup a meeting for a database team, that could work. Many component meetings have less than 5 people.\n@flixos90 To clarify, this conversation is slightly different and mostly unrelated to the \u201cunbundling Performance Lab plugin\u201d effort. While we are publishing other PL modules as standalone plugins, those standalone plugins will still be directly associated with the performance team, developed in the monorepo, referenced from the PL main plugin etc. Removing / decoupling SQLite from PL would be different: We would still support getting the plugin towards WP core of course, but it wouldn\u2019t be in any way connected to PL anymore. Maybe that was clear, but just in case.\nNext steps clarification:\n@aristath I think the only thing to do here would be to remove the module from PL, and add a notice so in case the user previously had the module activated, they\u2019ll be prompted to install the standalone plugin\n@joemcgill I assume we\u2019ll remove the module from the performance lab plugin in the same release where we remove other modules. How we handle the transition so as to not break any active sites, is not clear to me at the moment.\n@olliejones Do we have any usage telemetry to help guide that decision?\n@flixos90 Potentially. As mentioned, I think this conversation is decoupled from the general PL unbundling effort, so we could do it at the same time, but also sooner. I would love to find a way to make the transition smooth though. For sites that already have the SQLite module active, we should probably recommend activating the SQLite plugin before deactivating the feature.\n@aristath That\u2019s a good idea\u2026\n@flixos90 Has anyone tried yet to activate the SQLite standalone plugin on a site where the PL SQLite module is already active? We need to make sure it doesn\u2019t throw fatal errors\n@aristath Adding it on my TODO list for tomorrow, though from what I recall I tried it last month and I there were no issues. I\u2019ll need to test that again just to be sure, it\u2019s been a long time\n\n@10upsimon I feel strongly about not intentionally breaking users sites, however few are using it. Perhaps we need to defer the removal to 2 versions from now, and raise a notice or similar in the adminadmin (and super admin) making it very clear that from version\u00a0n\u00a0it will no longer be supported as a core PL module.\n@flixos90 agreed @10upsimon adding though that for a smooth transition the plugin should be activated before deactivating the PL module, so we have to make sure that that is actually possible\n\n@joemcgill A similar transition plan will be good for all of the modules, to be honest, even though SQLite is the most critical due to potential breakage.\n@flixos90 @joemcgill I think for the other modules we\u2019ll handle that in a central effort as part of unbundling, but with SQLite it will now be bit different, since that plugin will not be referenced directly from PL in the future. But I agree it\u2019s most critical there to have a smooth transition since switching back to a MySQLMySQL MySQL is a relational database management system. A database is a structured collection of data where content, configuration and other options are stored. https://www.mysql.com/. / MariaDB database accidentally will break any site that actually relies on SQLite right now\n\n\nPriority Projects\nServer Response Time\nLink to roadmap projects\nContributors: @joemcgill @spacedmonkey @aristath\n@spacedmonkey I landed lazy loading term metaMeta Meta is a term that refers to the inside workings of a group. For us, this is the team that works on internal WordPress sites like WordCamp Central and Make WordPress.https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/commit/2c6bf77a9e7532c6ac3a03502b44d108cae86179\nI hope to get comment meta in the next week.https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/4128\u00a0\u2013 Code review welcome\nRelated to term meta,\u00a0https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/4259\u00a0also need code review\nThis saves around 15k calls to sanitise term function per page load\nTLDR, there was no need to call\u00a0get_term\u00a0, we already had the term id, so just remove that\nI also reviewed this \u2013\u00a0https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/4097 (amazing work @oandregal)\n@joemcgill This is a huge one that I had noticed in my profiling research, so nice to see this already addressed!\n@10upsimon Call me cheesy, but 15%\u00a0server time\u00a0alone across many WP hosts is a positive contribution to the environment alone\n@mukesh27 With all this improvement, 6.3 is faster than 6.2\n@flixos90 Yeah, this alone will make blockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. theme performance in 6.3 almost as much faster as it got faster in 6.2\n\n@flixos90 Certainly the highest performance improvement in a single PR that I\u2019ve seen so far\n@joemcgill Worth noting that the 15% improvement on that PR is compared against WP 6.1.1, not the commit prior to that one, so it would be interesting to A/B against the commit prior (if I\u2019m reading the workflow correctly)\n@flixos90 No, the 15% is against today\u2019s\u00a0trunk. The original metrics on the PR are incorrect, but then I measured it against\u00a0trunk\u00a0and that\u2019s where the 15% come from\n\n\nDatabase Optimization\nLink to roadmap projects\nContributors: @aristath @spacedmonkey @olliejones @rjasdfiii\n@olliejones I\u2019ve been on the SQLite Object Cache, making it more useful for @spacedmonkey hopefully \u2013 Nothing on the bigger SQLite project.\n@spacedmonkey Not related to database, but object caching.

Thanks @joemcgill @adamsilverstein and @westonruter\u00a0for the invaluable feedback thus far (and to @spacedmonkey)\nWe\u2019ve established a mostly approved documentation plan/roadmap, with slight ongoing tweaks thereto. Draft documentation and documentation updates can commence soon\n\n@flixos90 One more thing regarding JSJS JavaScript, a web scripting language typically executed in the browser. Often used for advanced user interfaces and behaviors. & CSS, last week I opened\u00a0https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/49927\u00a0to optimize how block CSS is loaded in classic themes (it\u2019s great in block themes, but not so much for classic themes, and we can probably improve that). There have been some great conversations on that.\u00a0@aristath has pointed out a detailed code example with how we could improve this by printing inline styles per block type right before the first block of each type is rendered\n@aristath If you have some capacity to work on a PR, I think that would be a great next step\n@flixos90 If we can find a solution that works reliably, maybe we can eventually even change the default behavior so that it\u2019s no longer opt-in but just works out of the box\u00a0\n@spacedmonkey I have a PR for the above \u2013\u00a0\u00a0https://github.com/spacedmonkey/wordpress-develop/tree/try/inline-styles It might be useful in discovery\n\nImages\nLink to roadmap projects\nContributors: @flixos90 @thekt12 @adamsilverstein @joemcgill\nNo updates this week\nMeasurement\nLink to roadmap projects\nContributors: @adamsilverstein @olliejones @joemcgill @mukesh27\n@joemcgill I\u2019ve been working to prioritize a set of \u201cnext steps\u201d for automated performance testing.
