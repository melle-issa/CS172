Students with meal plans can contact email maiywhite@chapman.edu or cedavis@chapman.edu\nKosher food for Passover will be available for breakfast, lunch and dinner April 6-13. Information will be posted at @chapmanjewishlife on Instagram.\nStudents without meal plans, faculty and staff can buy five meal tickets at a discount. Those interested can contact interfaith@chapman.edu or Speight for Ramadan, jspeight@chapman.edu and Siegel for Passover, ansiegel@chapman.edu\nStudents fasting during Ramadan \u2013 the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, which starts the evening of March 22 \u2013 can sign up for meals each day. During the 29 to 30 days of the lunar month of Ramadan, which commemorates the revelation of the Quran, able Muslims must fast between dawn and sunset.\nFor the first time, students can pick up a snack to break their fast at sunset, a nighttime meal and a pre-dawn meal for the next day, says Speight (LLM \u201920).\n\u201cThis is definitely an improvement as far as anything we offer,\u201d he says.\nInterested students can fill out an interest form that will lead them to a meal request form. Speight is working with residence life and Sodexo to designate places students can pick up meals outside dining hall hours \u2013 like the basement of Henley Hall and at Rinker Health Sciences Campus \u2013 and ensuring there are microwaves available.\nStudents at Rinker don\u2019t need to sign up for meal pickup. Meals will be available daily around the clock at two grab-and-go stations and 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the Aspretto station.\nAdditionally, students, faculty and staff can attend a community iftar, the Ramadan post-sunset meal. Fish Interfaith is hosting the dinners \u2013 including Chapman\u2019s first Eid al-Fitr, the end of Ramadan celebration \u2013 and distributing a flier with an RSVP QR code. The Muslim Student Association will promote meals on social media.\n\u201cIt speaks to Chapman\u2019s desire to tell students, \u2018If you\u2019re Muslim, consider going to Chapman because this is here for you,\u2019\u201d Speight says. \u201cWhen I was in school and converted to Islam, I didn\u2019t have access to any of this \u2013 I had to fend for myself.\u201d\nDuring Passover, Randall Dining Commons will serve kosher food for Passover April 6-13. Passover commemorates the Jews\u2019 exodus from slavery in Egypt as told in Jewish scripture. In addition to food being prepared kosher, it must also be unleavened during Passover.\u00a0\nPreparing an area in the dining hall for kosher food prep has been a \u201clabor of love,\u201d Siegel says.\nSodexo staff worked for months to outfit an area of Randall for kosher food preparation, source ingredients and plan the menu, she says.\n\u201cAll the extra hours put into this have been done with care and kindness \u2013 it means a lot to the Jewish community,\u201d she says.\nAny student with meal plans can try kosher breakfast, lunch and dinner during Passover.\u00a0\nStudents without meal plans, faculty and staff who want to eat Passover and Ramadan meals can buy packs of five meal tickets at a discount.\nIt\u2019s the first year Sodexo will make fresh meals on site \u2013 in the past, pre-packaged kosher meals were brought in from a vendor, Siegel says.\n\u201cThis is a really big deal because there just aren\u2019t that many kosher caterers in Orange County,\u201d she says.\nChapman\u2019s Chabad and Hillel student groups will have seders and will promote the dining hall meals on social media. Chabad\u2019s rabbi worked with his contacts to ensure kosher supervision at all times during Passover, Siegel says.\n\u201cI really want this to feel like an all-campus effort to promote a sense of belonging for Jewish students; that the university is listening to the needs of the Jewish community on campus and working really hard to meet those needs for Passover,\u201d she says.\nShe and Speight both hope faculty, staff, students and visitors from all backgrounds try the food.\n\u201cThe menu looks delicious \u2013 I hope people come,\u201d Speight says.\u00a0\nSiegel says she\u2019s gotten emails from students, faculty and staff \u201cexcited that this is happening.\u201d\n\u201cWhen the directors of Muslim and Jewish life approached us for assistance in bringing this to a reality for our community, we believed it to be a natural fit for our work in promoting a more inclusive campus community,\u201d says Gabriela Castaneda, Ed.D., director of Latinx achievement in the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. \u201cIt was clearly a DEI initiative, and we were happy to provide leadership.\u201d\n\n\ncampus diversity dining Director of Jewish Life diversity and inclusion diversity equity & inclusion Eid Fish Interfaith Center Food kosher meals Muslim life office of residence life Passover Ramadan Sodexo \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJoy Juedes \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAngela Ramirez\u2019s Journey as a Chapman C-TAG Student\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrating the Life and Legacy of C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership That Spans the Campus Jack of all trades Kyle Tanimura is leaving quite the lasting mark on Chapman, where he has taken on multiple leadership roles as a double major in political science and strategic and corporate communication, with a...\n\n\nMay 1, 2023 Jennifer Winfield\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Pacific Islander Desi American Heritage Month Events at Chapman University Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Heritage Month, which runs from May 1 to 31, celebrates the identities, histories and experiences of the APIDA community.
