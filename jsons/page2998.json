Students who have a final on Friday of Finals Week are required to move out no later than 11:00 a.m. on May 20, 2023. Before you move out, make sure to change your mailing address, recycle, donate, and, throw away trash, and restore your residence. For more information, visit the Move Out\u00a0webpage.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are hereREACH Home \u203a  \nContinuing SSU Student Application Process\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications for Continuing SSU Students\nPriority application\u00a0period February 7 - 16, 2023. Even though the priority housing application period is over, you can still apply to live on campus for the next academic year!\u00a0Because capacity has not been reached, students who apply by 2/26 will be assigned a lottery number on 2/27 so they can participate in the room selection process.\n\nLet\u2019s put the myth to rest - you CAN live on campus for multiple years!\u00a0\nOur Tuscany Village townhomes and the Beaujolais Village and Sauvignon Village apartments are popular, but that doesn\u2019t mean we will not be able to house you!\u00a0 Below is a brief description on how the application process works for Fall 2023/Spring 2024 Academic Year or Spring 2024 semester ALL\u00a0for our continuing Seawolves (currently living on campus or living off campus wanting to move on).\nEnsure you are meeting deadlines by checking your SSU email daily.\nWhen you apply, you will make a $300 Housing Down Payment.\u00a0 The $300 will be applied to your first-semester rent charges. (Students who have a financial hardship should contact the REACH Office\u00a048 hours prior to any deadline for alternative payment options).\nStudents must be in good financial standing in order to secure/maintain a room assignment.\nRoom assignments are NOT GUARANTEED.\u00a0 Priority is determined by your lottery/waitlist number for the Fall/Spring application\u00a0or the date you apply to live on campus for Spring.\nPriority Applications for the 2023/2024 academic year open on February 7 and will close on February 16 at 4:00 p.m.\u00a0See the 2023/2024 drop-down menu below for instructions.\nStudents who apply during this time will be assigned a lottery number for assignment.\nPriority is given to students currently living on campus for Spring 2023.\n\nContinuing students who miss the deadline can still apply!\u00a0If capacity has not been reached, students will be assigned a lottery number, otherwise, they will be placed on a waitlist based on when they applied after the deadline.\nApplications for Spring 2024 ONLY open October 1.\u00a0 Apply early for the best chance of getting your preferred room type and location.\nPlease note housing applications are accepted until capacity is reached. In the event that we reach capacity, we will continue to accept applications and payments. Students will be placed on a waitlist. In the event that we are unable to house you one week after the semester begins, we will refund the payment in full.\n\u00a0\nBefore you begin...\n\u00a0We encourage students to research their options ahead of time:\nIs there a Living Learning Community or Village that interests you?\nWhile not required, students can join a Living Learning Community (LLC) to get connected and continue to participate in building a thriving living environment (LLCs are connected to specific villages/room types).\u00a0 Others may prefer a specific village or building. Note: Alsace will not be available as it has been designated as the Transfer House.\nWhat room type fits your budget?\nTake a look at our\u00a0On Campus Rates & Installments. \u00a0It is important to know the cost of where you are going to live and what is affordable. Meal Plans are not required for sophomores and above, but are encouraged.\nWhat room type are you looking for?\nDo you prefer a single, double or triple occupancy room?\u00a0 Check out the\u00a0Housing Options. (some room types are limited).\nEligibility?\n\nBe enrolled in at least 9 units each semester.\nHave a $0 housing rent/food balance from previous semesters.\nNeed to Cancel?\nCancellations received by June 1 for Fall applicants, and December 15 for Spring only applicants will receive a 50% refund of the Housing Down Payment; no refund thereafter.\u00a0 Students who complete the application process and receive a room assignment from REACH will be charged a $250 fee for not providing thirty (30) day notice if they cancel after August 1 for Fall January 1 for Spring, or fail to check in seven (7) days after the start of the semester.\n\u00a0\nApply for Housing & Assignment Process\u2026..\nSelect the Term you are wanting to apply for below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    2023/2024 Academic Year  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    2023/2024 Application Timeline  \n\n\nIncoming students are assigned a residential space in June, therefore, room selection for continuing students is generally available before the incoming first-year, transfer, and graduate students are assigned. The general room selection process, in March, is a lottery-based process. General room selection is not a first-come, first-served process. Late applicants will be assigned based on when they apply.\nLog into the Housing Portal (you will need your SSU username and password) and click on \"2023/2024 Academic Year Housing.\"\n\n\tApplications are available February 7 - 16 at 4:00 p.m.\u00a0 While the application process is NOT first come first serve, if you choose to apply on the first day, to prevent overloading the system, we need to stagger the application process. Please apply during your designated time:\u00a0\n\nCabernet & Zinfandel resident @ 10 a.m.\nVerdot resident @ 11 a.m.\nSauvignon resident @ 1 p.m.\nBeaujolais resident @ 2 p.m.\nTuscany resident @ 3 p.m.\nSSU Student living off campus 4:00 p.m.\nMake the $300 Housing Down Payment.\n\tIf you are experiencing financial hardship, please email our office for an alternative payment option.\n\nComplete your profile information and agree to the terms and conditions of the student housing license agreement. You will receive a confirmation that this step was completed. Students who do not complete this process will not receive a lottery number.\nSelect your preferred Living Community (optional)\n\tMake sure you reviewed the Housing Options and On Campus Rates as some Living Communities are limited to certain room types.\n\nReceive your lottery number on February 27 with instructions on when and how to self-select your Fall & Spring room assignment.\nCreate a Roommate PIN.\u00a0 Students wanting to live with others will need to create a personal Roommate PIN prior to the start of the room selection process.\nRoom Selection: March 7 - 9\n\tRoom Selection is available only to students who have received a lottery number. The lottery number represents the date and time a student can participate in the room selection process. During this time, students will select the specific apartment and bedroom \u201cletter\u201d for the full academic year.\n\nMarch 7: Room selection for a complete group that can FILL an apartment (Beaujolais 4 residents total, Sauvignon 6-7 residents total, Tuscany 6 residents total).\u00a0 Choose from any available apartment.\nMarch 8 & 9: Room selection for individuals or non-complete groups. Choose from any available apartment/bed spaces.\nPlease note, room types and location are not guaranteed and are based on inventory.\nStudents are encouraged to select a room regardless if it is not their first choice. Students will forfeit their space and have their application canceled if they fail to select a room.\nAgain, we strongly encourage students to book a room, although their preferred room type or location is not available, at their lottery time. Students can participate in a room change process that will open in the following weeks.\n*Need to cancel? Cancellations received by June 1 for Fall applicants will receive a 50% refund of the Housing Down Payment; no refund thereafter.\u00a0 Students who complete the application process and receive a room assignment from REACH will be charged a $250 fee for not providing thirty (30) day notice, if they cancel after August 1 for Fall, or fail to check-in seven (7) days after the start of the semester.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    General Room Selection Information for 2023/2024  \n\n\nStudents will be self selecting a bedspace for the following Academic Year March 7 - 9.\u00a0 Please see our General Room Selection webpage for more information\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Roommates  \n\n\nOur housing system requires you to select your roommate BEFORE you choose your room. If you want to make sure you have the roommate you want, you will need to create a personalized access code in order to room with friends. In the Housing Portal, click on \"Current Resident,\" then \"Roommate/Group Access Code\" to create your personalized code. Give this to the person/group with whom you want to live. This is only available to those who have been offered a space. Students not offered a space for the General Room Selection will not be able to participate in this process. When you select your room, the first roommate in the process will pull the other roommate into the selected room using the PIN code.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Further Questions?   \n\n\nPlease read through our Reapply Process FAQs for all your questions about down payments, room selection, and offers.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Spring 2024 Only  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Spring 2024 ONLY  \n\n\n\nLog into the Housing Portal (you will need your SSU username and password) and click on \"Apply Spring 2024.\"\n\n\nMake the $300 Housing Down Payment.\n\nFinancial Hardship? Please email our office for an alternative payment option.\n\n\n\nComplete your profile information and agree to the terms and conditions of the student housing license agreement.\n\n\nSelect your preferred\u00a0Living Learning Community.\n\nMake sure you reviewed the Housing Options and On Campus Rates & Installments as some Living Communities are limited to certain room types.\n\n\nYou can return to this section up until November 30 to update your preference without it affecting your priority.\n\n\n\nRequest a specific roommate *please contact the REACH Office for Spring only application instructions.\n\nRequests must be mutual (same living area and ranked room type). Roommates must request each other. Mismatched requests will not be processed.\n\n\nRoommate requests are viewed as a priority over room-type requests.\u00a0 This means we will do our best to assign you with your requested roommate first, regardless of the room type preference.\n\n\n\nRoom Assignments will be emailed to the student SSU email address in early December Spring only students. *Students must have paid the Housing Down Payment in full in order to receive a room assignment.\n\n*Need to cancel? Cancellations received by December\u00a015 for Spring\u00a0applicants will receive a 50% refund of the Housing Down Payment; no refund thereafter.\u00a0 Students who complete the application process and receive a room assignment from REACH will be charged a $250 fee for not providing thirty (30) day notice, if they cancel after January\u00a01 for Spring, or fail to check in seven (7) days after the start of the semester.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidential Education and Campus Housing\n\nREACH  Home\nApply for Housing\nHousing Options\nOn Campus Rates & Installments\nHousing Portal\nMove In & Move Out\nResident Services & Resources\nFire Safety Report\nEmployee Housing\nLiving Off-Campus\nParent/Guardian\nWhy Live at SSU?\nAbout REACH\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFacebook for REACH \n\n\nInstagram for REACH\n\n\nYouTube for REACH\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSU Facebook\nSSU Twitter\nSSU Instagram\nSSU Youtube\nSSU News RSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Ave\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n707.664.2880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact SSU\nPrivacy Notice\nCalifornia State University\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSafeSSU\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\nEmergency Information\nJobs\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
