March 8, 2023, was the first time in three years that the David Nazarian College of Business and Economics hosted the speaker series in person. Photo by David J. Hawkins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was standing-room only at CSUN\u2019s Orchard Conference Center on March 8 as the David Nazarian College of Business and Economics welcomed its first in-person distinguished speaker\u00a0since 2020.\u00a0Investor, philanthropist and alumnus Ramesh Damani \u201979 (Business Administration), M.S. \u201981,\u00a0 joined the esteemed ranks of the college\u2019s Younes Nazarian Distinguished Speaker Series, which aims\u00a0to inspire students and alumni by bringing high-level executives to campus.\nDamani\u2019s extensive career\u00a0has encompassed global technology, business and innovation. He currently serves as the Chairman of the Board at DMart.\u00a0He also hosts CNBC\u2019s long-running \u201cWizards of the Street\u201d program.\nIn his prepared remarks, \u201cLeadership in a Global Economy,\u201d Damani advocated for a closer economic partnership between the United States and India. \u201cIndia\u2019s importance to the U.S. and the world rests on the three-legged stool of demographics, democracy and digitization,\u201d \u00a0he said. Adding that an economic partnership between the two nations could bring much-needed reciprocity, allowing each country\u2019s strengths to shore up the other\u2019s weaknesses.\nAs India has developed pathways for foreign direct investment, attracting companies such as Apple, Airbus and Boeing, this has opened opportunities for job-seekers. Damani encouraged his audience to think of themselves as global citizens and familiarize themselves with the nuances of other cultures.\n\u201cSee opportunity wherever you see it in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just within the 50 square miles or so where you live.\u201d\nFollowing his speech, Damani sat down with moderator Wendy Greuel, executive-in-residence in the CSUN Nazarian College, and\u00a0took questions from her and the audience.\u00a0Their discussion covered topics that ranged from Damani\u2019s first job in the tech industry to his investment advice. Throughout the evening, Damani returned to the idea that immigration plays a critical role in maintaining the health of any economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s symptomatic of the greatness of America,\u201d he said, \u201cthat you allow merit to rise to the top. That you\u2019re not judging people who are fit for the job based on ethnicity or on whiteness, or\u00a0based on how long they live in this country \u2014 but by saying: \u2018Who is the best person for this job?\u2019 It\u2019s an extraordinary culture you\u2019ve created by attracting the best and the brightest in the world.\u201d\n\nThis prompted Greuel to ask the room, how many in the audience were immigrants. Nearly 40 percent of those in attendance raised their hands.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the story of America,\u201d Damani said, marveling. He himself was \u201ca middle-class kid from Mumbai, India, who grew up with a few dollars of pocket money.\u201d His mother worried he\u2019d never make a living. He said that coming to CSUN opened up the world to him and provided the skills and the confidence to become what he is today. \u201cIf I can do it, so can you,\u201d he said.\nOne student raised his hand\u00a0and asked what it would take to get just 2 minutes of the executive\u2019s time.\n\u201cBuy me a cup of coffee,\u201d Damani answered, laughing. Then added, \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll give you my business card.\u201d Damani has mentored students at CSUN and provided educational services to students throughout India for decades. He believes that mentorship and the right educational opportunities for everyone will create a better world for us all.\nIn 2009, Damani joined\u00a0the Avenue Supermart grocery store chain and, as chairman of the board, took the Indian company public and led it through a multi-year expansion. Using\u00a0Walmart\u00a0as a model, Damani led Avenue Supermart, now DMart, to become India\u2019s highest valued retail chain.\u00a0Damani credited the American values of openness and honesty that he learned at CSUN for his business success.\n\u201cThe influence of America runs deep within me and within the companies I serve,\u201d he said.\nPast speakers in the college\u2019s Distinguished Speaker Series\u00a0include Jane Wurwand, founder of Dermalogica, and alumni Steve Rabuchin, head of Amazon Alexa Voice Services, and Michael Grillo, executive producer on the Marvel\u2019s \u201cAvengers\u201d films.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Featured\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n\n\n\nCSUN Success Story: How Malachia Hoover\u2019s Time as a Matador Put Her on the Path to Saving Lives\n\n\nStudying Away \u2013 Get to Know the International and Exchange Student Center\n\n\nNew Tech and a Sense of Community: CSUN\u2019s Assistive Technology Conference Celebrates 38 Years\n\n\nCSUN to host multimedia performance that explores climate change\n\n\n\u2018Ghosts\u2019 Stories: On a Hit TV Show, CSUN Alum Uses His Voice\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u2190 CSUN Prof\u2019s Research Helps Uncover Clues About the Lives of European Hunter-Gatherers Who Lived Tens of Thousands of Years Ago\nTriennial Presidential Review by CSU Board of Trustees Underway \u2192\n\n\n\n\n Top Stories\n\n\n\nFeatured Tag\n\n\n\n\n\n \u2018Ghosts\u2019 Stories: On a Hit TV Show, CSUN Alum Uses His Voice\non April 26, 2023in Alumni, Arts and Culture\n\n\n Tribal Leader, Philanthropist and Acclaimed Author to Receive Honorary Doctorates from CSUN\non April 25, 2023in Alumni, Community, CSU News, CSUN Events, Education, Faculty and Staff News, Graduation Ceremony, Honors & Awards, Media Releases, University News\n\n\n CSUN Breaks Ground on Autodesk Technology Engagement Center, a Project with National Impact\non April 24, 2023in Donor Profile, Giving\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCSU Resources CSU Leader\nCSYouCSU News\n\nTopicsArts and Culture\nAthletics\nBusiness\nCommunity\nCSU News\nEducation\nFaculty and Staff News\nHealth and Fitness\nMedia Releases\nPolitics and Society\nScience and Technology\n CSUN in the News\n\nCalifornia State University Northridge President Dr. Erika D.
