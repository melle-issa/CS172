They saw that failure may offer more learning potential than success. They discovered that the path to one\u2019s career isn\u2019t always direct, and that a \u201cdream job\u201d might not be the right fit, after all. They found that defying norms and expectations can lead to profound, personal transformations.\nFor some faculty, even ordinary jobs led to extraordinary experiences that changed how they viewed the world, inspiring questions about social justice, democracy, artificial intelligence and gender equality \u2013 topics that became the foundation of their research and academic career.\nFrom summers in 1963 to as recent as 2007, here are some of their stories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAudrey Shafer\nProfessor of anesthesiology\nRead story\n\n\n\n \n\nWah Chiu\nProfessor of bioengineering\nRead story\n\n\n\n \n\nKathryn Olivarius\nAssistant professor of history\nRead story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI wanted to do something with my career where I could, at the end of the day, come home, look myself in the mirror and say that I took a tiny, little step to make the world a better place.\u201d\n\u2013 FORREST STUART, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nKarl Eikenberry\nDirector of the U.S.-Asia Security Initiative, Walter H.

(Photo courtesy of Audrey Shafer)\n\nIn the summer of 1978, between graduating college and starting Stanford Medical School, I needed to make some money. But I also wanted to learn how to drive. While I had a driver\u2019s license, I probably had no more than three hours of driving experience. Our family could not afford a car when I was in high school when most kids learn how to drive.\nI took a job at a travel agency delivering airline tickets in the Boston area. Back then, particularly in business, airline tickets were booked through a travel agent who printed the physical ticket required for boarding the plane. The ticket would then need to be delivered to the office where that person worked.\nThe travel agency gave me a car to use, insurance and gas. Navigation was different then \u2013 it was way before GPS \u2013 so I always had a map open on the passenger seat. There were times I had no idea where to go. Boston drivers were quite quick to hit their horns at a 21-year-old learning to navigate traffic circles or rotaries \u2013 of which there were a lot of in and around the city.\nThere was one blunder I remember in particular. I was in a rush trying to parallel park on Massachusetts Avenue, a very busy city street by MIT. I accidentally hooked the car\u2019s fender to the parked car in front of me. The owner of the vehicle owned a pizza shop across the street and he came out yelling at me. I thought for sure I was going to get fired \u2013 but the manager of the travel agency was so kind after I explained what happened. He told me it was OK and not to worry. His response was a huge lesson to me about being a boss: how to judge the emotional level of your employees when they\u2019ve made an error and gauge whether they have already chastised themselves enough for their mistake.\nLooking back, this was a job that simply doesn\u2019t exist anymore. Technology has transformed the travel industry. My summer job has been replaced by customers making a few clicks to get their own airline tickets.\nHaving had a job that does not exist now has made me interested in how technology interfaces with and replaces humans. I think about other tasks people do that will be considered anachronistic in the future. I work in medicine where artificial intelligence is used more and more. There are many studies about the capability of AI to examine images and how technology and algorithms can be more accurate than human analysis for diagnostics. I wonder, where will such advances lead us? I am certain that a future self-driving car will handle Boston\u2019s rotaries far better than I did!\nAudrey Shafer is a professor of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine and director of Medicine and the Muse at Stanford Medicine.\nAs told to Melissa De Witte\n\n\nClose window\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAudrey Shafer\n\n\n\nAudrey Shafer delivered airplane tickets in the Boston, Massachusetts area.

(Photos courtesy of Wah Chiu)\n\nThe summer of 1966, after my freshman year at the University of California, Berkeley, I got my first job ever, working at Yosemite National Park.\nI got the job through the UC Berkeley Job Placement Center; however, I had never heard of Yosemite National Park. I came to UC Berkeley as an international student from Hong Kong and I wasn\u2019t knowledgeable about U.S. National Parks. The only thing I knew was that I had to get a job to pay my tuition. So, I interviewed for the park service, along with a few other students from UC Berkeley, who also joined me that summer.\nWe also didn\u2019t know what we were going to do until we got there \u2013 which was by Greyhound Bus from Berkeley.\nI remember showing up very nervous.

The breathtaking scenery was unimaginable.\nBut at first, I was focused on the work.\nWe had to get up at 6 in the morning. We didn\u2019t really understand why tourists got up so early. As students, we stayed up late and woke up late \u2013 that was our life on campus. But at Yosemite, we had to start really early. We all shared outdoor tents \u2013 there were two or three of us to a tent.

Eventually, after I found my routine, I would hike or rent a bicycle on my day off.\nAt Yosemite, we didn\u2019t get any tips. We did get free food, but only from the cafeteria.

(Photos courtesy of Kathryn Olivarius)\n\nI went to Keewaydin Canoe Camp in northern Ontario for several summers, starting at age 13. Keewaydin is not like other summer camps \u2013 we don\u2019t do arts and crafts, archery or rock climbing. Instead, we canoe through the Canadian wilderness, paddling and portaging for weeks using traditional equipment like wood-canvas canoes; wannigans \u2013 wooden boxes in which we carry food and equipment; and tumplines \u2013 long, leather straps you tie around your gear to carry it across land. The ultimate trip as a camper is a seven-week expedition, thousands of kilometers long, through the remote wilderness of northern Quebec to the Hudson Bay. You don\u2019t see any people outside your group or even traces of other people, except for the float plane pilot who resupplies you with food halfway through. I did this trip as a camper in 2006.\nWhen I began college at Yale University in 2007, I joined the camp staff and worked there every summer as a guide while I was an undergraduate. I remember feeling a lot of pressure in college to get a summer internship in New York City, do academic research or spend time with my family in the UK. But I just kept going back to Keewaydin. My first summer on staff, I led the youngest campers on short trips around the base camp on Lake Temagami. In 2010, I guided 12 18-year-old girls on the Bay trip.\n\nDuring her college summers, Kathryn Olivarius opted for the great outdoors.\n\nAs a staff person, you are both inside and outside the group. You want the girls to have fun and be part of that fun, but ultimately you are responsible for their safety, so have to stay somewhat removed.\nBut from this position of remove, you see the seismic shifts in how a group works. You feel it when morale is low, when people are hungry and tired. You can feel it too as a group gets faster, stronger and more cohesive. There is a special pride you feel when a camper reaches her own individual goal. You get to see all the little moments of growth that make the big, life-changing growth possible.\nWhen I came to Keewaydin in 2002, the camp had only accepted girls for two years. For most of its existence \u2013 since 1893 \u2013 it had been an all-boys camp. It was obvious that many of the men \u2013 whose fathers, grandfathers and great-grandfathers had come of age at this camp \u2013 were not happy about girls being there. They saw carrying heavy loads across the barren tundra, axe skills and smelling like sweat and mildew for 50 days as innately masculine and hardcore.\nBut that didn\u2019t matter to us. Many of the staff women had this almost subversive sense of alternative tradition-building \u2013 that we were somehow defying gender norms by teaching girls to take pride in physical strength. There was an organic, feminist energy about the experience as we worked to make the tradition open to us, too. As we paddled, the staff women talked about literature, history, pop culture and school with our campers. But we also talked about feminism, gender and equality. I\u2019ve heard from many of my former campers that Keewaydin functioned as a kind of training ground for them to think about gender inequality and identity in their future lives.\nWhen you spend seven weeks with a dozen other people in the wilderness, you develop deep bonds and reliance on others.\n\nKathryn Olivarius led girls from ages 11 to 18 through Northern Ontario.\n\nWhat are the lasting lessons? Being bad at things \u2013 even failing \u2013 can be good. Failure gives you grit; challenges make you humbler and stronger. And even when you are floating down a rapid, your boat capsized and all your gear strewn across the river, you have to see the silver lining, laugh and try again. I still try to practice that mindset in real life, only now the challenges are book chapters and lecture writing, not 5K portages or a camper with a sprained ankle. Most of all, it\u2019s important to take a deep breath, physically take yourself out your comfort zone and go off-the-grid for a bit.\nKathryn Olivarius is assistant professor of history in the School of Humanities and Sciences.\nAs told to Alex Shashkevich\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose window\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nKathryn Olivarius\n\n\n\nKathryn Olivarius was a canoe guide in the Canadian wilderness.

(Photo courtesy of the National Archives, photo no. 6663200)\n\nIn 1971, I was a rising junior at West Point, the United States Military Academy. That summer I spent three weeks at Fort Benning, Georgia, at the U.S. Army Airborne School \u2013 also known as Jump School \u2013 for paratrooper training. The Basic Airborne Course is a physically demanding, rigorous three-week curriculum that teaches soldiers how to jump from a U.S. military aircraft in flight and safely land on the ground.\nThere is a popular expression about how life begins at the end of the comfort zone. Before I began the training, my comfort zone certainly did not include jumping out of airplanes. Even after three weeks of intense preparation \u2013 which included a week of jumping from 34-foot towers \u2013 I was nervous about my first jump.\nIt was a one-hour ride from the military airfield at Fort Benning to the drop zone and I remember sitting there inside a U.S. Air Force C-130 transport aircraft, all loaded up with my parachute, helmet and other equipment on.\nAs the aircraft rumbled toward the drop zone, one of the cadre, a very seasoned sergeant, gets in front of me, grabs my two shoulder straps, looks me in the face and because of the deafening engine noise, shouted at me: \u201cAirborne,\u201d\u2013 which is how all students are addressed \u2013 \u201care you nervous?\u201d\nAnd although I was nervous, I gave the answer I thought he wanted to hear.\n\u201cNo, Sergeant,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not nervous.\u201d\nThe sergeant looked at me and very calmly said: \u201cAirborne, I want you to be nervous. This is your first jump.\u201d\nI\u2019ll never forget that expression on his face and his sincerity.\n\u201cEvery time you jump out of an airplane in the future, I want you to be nervous,\u201d the sergeant said to me. \u201cBecause when you are nervous, you are thinking hard about the challenge you are facing. In your mind, you are going through all the training you had \u2013 what is the next thing to do and what to do should something go wrong.\u201d\nAnd then he said: \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want you to do is be afraid. Be nervous, but don\u2019t be afraid. If you let your fears control you, then you are going to make a mistake.\u201d\nAs I waited the several seconds for my parachute to deploy and began my descent to the ground below, I remembered that sergeant\u2019s words of wisdom \u2013 and I focused, focused, focused. You have deep appreciation for the different processes that led you to that moment and all the rules to do it safely \u2013 they teach you certain ways to exit the aircraft, check your parachute canopy for a full opening, steer clear of fellow jumpers, choose a landing point and steer into the wind and how to make contact with the ground to avoid injury.\nIt\u2019s a good life lesson. Whether you are getting ready for a job interview or delivering a presentation, you should feel a little nervous. If you don\u2019t feel nervous at all and are just feeling good, you are probably not going to be on your best game. But also \u2013 don\u2019t be afraid.\nAnd that\u2019s one of the lessons I learned from the U.S. Army Airborne School.\n Karl Eikenberry is the Oksenberg-Rohlen Fellow and director of the U.S.-Asia Security Initiative at the Walter H.

(Photo courtesy of the National Archives, photo no. 6663200)\n\nIn 1971, I was a rising junior at West Point, the United States Military Academy. That summer I spent three weeks at Fort Benning, Georgia, at the U.S. Army Airborne School \u2013 also known as Jump School \u2013 for paratrooper training. The Basic Airborne Course is a physically demanding, rigorous three-week curriculum that teaches soldiers how to jump from a U.S. military aircraft in flight and safely land on the ground.\nThere is a popular expression about how life begins at the end of the comfort zone. Before I began the training, my comfort zone certainly did not include jumping out of airplanes. Even after three weeks of intense preparation \u2013 which included a week of jumping from 34-foot towers \u2013 I was nervous about my first jump.\nIt was a one-hour ride from the military airfield at Fort Benning to the drop zone and I remember sitting there inside a U.S. Air Force C-130 transport aircraft, all loaded up with my parachute, helmet and other equipment on.\nAs the aircraft rumbled toward the drop zone, one of the cadre, a very seasoned sergeant, gets in front of me, grabs my two shoulder straps, looks me in the face and because of the deafening engine noise, shouted at me: \u201cAirborne,\u201d\u2013 which is how all students are addressed \u2013 \u201care you nervous?\u201d\nAnd although I was nervous, I gave the answer I thought he wanted to hear.\n\u201cNo, Sergeant,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m not nervous.\u201d\nThe sergeant looked at me and very calmly said: \u201cAirborne, I want you to be nervous. This is your first jump.\u201d\nI\u2019ll never forget that expression on his face and his sincerity.\n\u201cEvery time you jump out of an airplane in the future, I want you to be nervous,\u201d the sergeant said to me. \u201cBecause when you are nervous, you are thinking hard about the challenge you are facing. In your mind, you are going through all the training you had \u2013 what is the next thing to do and what to do should something go wrong.\u201d\nAnd then he said: \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want you to do is be afraid. Be nervous, but don\u2019t be afraid. If you let your fears control you, then you are going to make a mistake.\u201d\nAs I waited the several seconds for my parachute to deploy and began my descent to the ground below, I remembered that sergeant\u2019s words of wisdom \u2013 and I focused, focused, focused. You have deep appreciation for the different processes that led you to that moment and all the rules to do it safely \u2013 they teach you certain ways to exit the aircraft, check your parachute canopy for a full opening, steer clear of fellow jumpers, choose a landing point and steer into the wind and how to make contact with the ground to avoid injury.\nIt\u2019s a good life lesson. Whether you are getting ready for a job interview or delivering a presentation, you should feel a little nervous. If you don\u2019t feel nervous at all and are just feeling good, you are probably not going to be on your best game. But also \u2013 don\u2019t be afraid.\nAnd that\u2019s one of the lessons I learned from the U.S. Army Airborne School.\n Karl Eikenberry is the Oksenberg-Rohlen Fellow and director of the U.S.-Asia Security Initiative at the Walter H.

(Photo courtesy of Amy Zegart)\n\nIn college, I really wanted a career in broadcast journalism. There was no internet, so at the beginning of my junior year, I sent a shot-in-the-dark snail mail letter to Diane Sawyer, who was a television star at CBS News. The gist of it was, \u201cHi. You\u2019re from Kentucky, and so am I. Will you hire me to be your summer intern?\u201d It wasn\u2019t exactly the strongest pitch, and the connection was a stretch to say the least, but it was all I had.\nTo her credit, Diane Sawyer wrote back and told me in the nicest possible way that no, she would not hire me, but I should write to someone else at CBS. Which I did. Every month. All year long. As time went by, I didn\u2019t get an answer, but I did get endless grief from my friends. \u201cThere goes Amy, writing to CBS again. How\u2019s that internship coming?\u201d\nAnd then, lo and behold, one day near the end of school, I got a call from CBS Evening News saying I\u2019d landed one of the show\u2019s two coveted internships in New York. When I asked why on Earth they hired me without an interview, they said anyone who wrote that many letters had the persistence of a good journalist. So, I moved to New York, armed with three cans of pepper spray my parents gave me.\nIt turned out to be an incredible experience that changed my life, but not in the way I ever expected. One disastrous night I nearly made the entire network go off the air. To be fair, it wasn\u2019t entirely my fault. The lead story was changing, an editor was making last-minute adjustments, and my job was to hand carry the edited videotape from the editing booth to the control room upstairs where it had to be inserted into some equipment to be broadcast.\nThirty years later, I can still picture the scene as I bolted into the control room, panting and panicking, with seconds to spare before the CBS feed nationwide went black. There was screaming. It was bedlam. Smoke was everywhere because the director \u2013 who runs the broadcast \u2013 was so stressed out, he was chain-smoking cigarettes out of both hands.\nIn that moment I realized two things: One, I am not a fast runner; and two, I do not like tight deadlines. Soon after, the show\u2019s executive producer encouraged me to apply for a Fulbright Fellowship and gently suggested that I consider a career with more research and less time pressure. And that\u2019s how I started thinking about becoming an academic.\nAmy Zegart is the Davies Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and a senior fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.\nAs told to Melissa De Witte\n\n\nClose window\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAmy Zegart\n\n\n\nAmy Zegart interned at CBS Evening News in New York City.

It\u2019s like a mini earthquake. You bounce, the ground bounces.\nWe also had to clear brush that we would burn in big fire pits, feeding the fire all day long.

A co-worker was stung so badly that he had to be taken away by ambulance and didn\u2019t return to work for the rest of summer.\nIt was different from Stanford all right. It exposed me to ways of life and work that were galaxies distant from what I knew or what I was preparing for.

So, one day after I cleaned her room, I sat down and took her hand in mine, and chanted \u201cOm\u201d for a few moments. She gave me a look I\u2019ll never forget. She couldn\u2019t really communicate any more, but it was like a light went on in her face that I hadn\u2019t seen ever before.

There was a very cantankerous woman who had the reputation of being really difficult. She was bedridden by the time I got there. It was clear that she didn\u2019t have much longer to live. She was of very tiny stature. She almost looked a child, very disconnected from reality. There was a Buddha statue next to her bed.\nI was interested in Buddhism at the time. So, one day after I cleaned her room, I sat down and took her hand in mine, and chanted \u201cOm\u201d for a few moments. She gave me a look I\u2019ll never forget. She couldn\u2019t really communicate any more, but it was like a light went on in her face that I hadn\u2019t seen ever before. It was such a moving moment \u2013 to realize what it meant for someone to do something as simple as hold their hand and make a sound that\u2019s meaningful to them. I learned that she died about a month afterward.\nDan Edelstein is the William H.

(Photo courtesy of Mary Hawn)\n\nI went to college at the University of Michigan and part of my financial aid package was a work-study grant. So as a young freshman in 1984 interested in science and medicine, I obtained a position in a scientific research lab with Tadataka Yamada, who was then the chief of gastroenterology. My primary task was to wash glassware and make solutions.\nBut I was really interested in some of the experiments that were being done by the other scientists, and I asked lots of questions about what they were doing. The other scientists, including Dr. Yamada, picked up on my interest. Through their mentorship, I applied for a grant from the American Gastroenterological Association\u2019s summer research fellowship to fund my own research project.\nI won one of the awards, which meant that after my sophomore year, I got a promotion from washing glassware to running my own research project on regulation of gastric acid secretion. Our experiments led to some really interesting findings that we submitted to the organization for their annual meeting. Not only was it selected, but I was awarded the best student research project.\nBecause of that, I got to present at the annual meeting, which also happened to my first time attending an academic conference. At the age of 20 I delivered my first scientific presentation in front of over 1,000 people. My talk was at the plenary session, which meant it was in the biggest room with the most people in it. This was before PowerPoint and I had to make three sets of slides for each of the screens in the room.\nI think I was too naive to know to be terrified! However, my mentor, Dr. Yamada, was nervous for me. Prior students who won this award were graduate or medical students, trainees and fellows. I remember he brought me up to the moderators and introduced me and made sure they knew I was an undergrad student so they wouldn\u2019t ask me too many technical questions.\nThat experience sparked and inspired my interest in becoming an academic physician and in gastrointestinal diseases.\nIt also gave me a lot of self-efficacy. It showed me that through hard work and collaboration, I can do this type of work. But I saw that I could not have done it by myself. I worked closely with my mentors and other investigators in the lab in order to accomplish the work.\nI also learned that not every experiment works. I found out why there\u2019s the \u201cre\u201d in research. You end up redoing a lot. Not everything works out the way you planned, but sometimes you learn more in the failure than you do in the success.\nMary T.

(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nIn 1997 I spent a few weeks in Rome interning for costume designer Gabriella Pescucci.\nBut it wasn\u2019t really an internship. Years ago, I had seen Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Age of Innocence (1993), for which Pescucci won an Oscar, and naively wrote her a letter to express my admiration. To my surprise, she replied, as she did to every other message I sent her. After a couple of awkward meetings, during which I was too starstruck to make much sense, she accepted my sheepish request to work as her handyman.\nSo that summer, I went to Rome, where Pescucci was prepping for Chilean director Raul Ruiz\u2019s adaptation of Marcel Proust\u2019s Time Regained. I sleepwalked anywhere she went. I accompanied her to the milliner, who was tasked to cover dozens of wide-brimmed hats with fake bird wings, and quietly sat when she discussed makeup with famous actresses calling from Paris. I carried mannequins, heavy ball gowns whose trains I wrapped around my neck and giant rolls of tulle.\nMostly, however, I was a fly on the wall. I listened to Pescucci\u2019s hopes of being hired for TV shows, which lasted longer and were better paid. (She eventually did work on The Borgias and Penny Dreadful.) I saw her managing deliveries and pickups of costumes for other productions \u2013many outfits for Madonna\u2019s Evita and Cate Blanchett\u2019s Elizabeth had been made in her sprawling, beautiful shop, lined with books and autographs of stars.\nAt lunch, I listened to Pescucci\u2019s verdicts on every single movie she saw \u2013 she went to the cinema every night \u2013 and to her advice of doing well at university since what the movie industry needed was culture, she said. She insisted that only a cultural whiz could produce something truly original in films, so she urged me to study history, history of art, and to devour as many books as I could. I took her words to heart and the following year I decided against majoring in film studies to read literature and philosophy instead.\nBut the change had not just been motivated by Pescucci\u2019s speeches. In truth, I felt burned out. I could not believe that such a famous designer could be jobless for months, and that this flawlessly elegant woman, who wore electric jumpsuits and stilettos, could ever worry about money. Later on, I started seeing her advice almost as a form of rescue. Much of Pescucci\u2019s work, after all, seemed to deal with logistics rather than ideas, but ideas \u2013 pyrotechnic ideas about narrative and visuals \u2013 were the very things that made movies so alluring to me. More than an internship, those few weeks in Rome made me reconsider my interests and my abilities in such a fundamental way that I don\u2019t think I would have become a professor in art history had I not been pushed by such a formidable woman.\nEmanuele Lugli is an assistant professor of art and art history in the School of Humanities and Sciences\n\n\nClose window\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEmanuele Lugli\n\n\n\nEmanuele Lugli interned for an award winning costume designer.

(Photo: Getty Images) (Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn the summers and winter breaks of 1980 and 1981 I worked at a catalog warehouse outside of Chicago. The job was simple \u2013 to unload 18-wheelers full of boxes of merchandise when they arrived, and to move the merchandise to shelves. It could be physical, as some products were much heavier than others. The merchandise was varied and so most of the unloading was by hand, and using pallets and hand-pulled hydraulic pallet trolleys.\nThe camaraderie kept the atmosphere lively and fun when we were hard at work. Indeed, the worst part of the job was the tedium \u2013 hours without a truck arriving nor with shelves to stock, sitting and waiting with endless boredom. It gave me a deep appreciation for the term clock-watching. Having friends to help pass that time was essential. The arrival of a truck always brought great excitement.\nI recall the feeling of disappointment when seeing my first paycheck and realizing that a chunk of it was going to union dues, even though I was earning minimum wage. The job also came with periodic lie detector tests, as a nontrivial source of loss to the company was theft by its own employees. This was clear from the extensive list of questions that were asked about stealing or knowledge of any theft, sprinkled with detailed questions about drug use on and off the job. It was not a nurturing atmosphere.\nOur lunches and dinners consisted of an assortment of fast-food available from nearby outlets \u2013 a steady diet of double hamburgers, tacos and oversized hot dogs. Even a young college student can be cured of any longing for fast food with an endless supply of it.\nLooking back on the experiences, they are very dear to me. When I arrived at school in the fall, my appetite for knowledge and intellectual stimulation was well stoked. And my appreciation for the life that it has led me to has been greatly enhanced. There were positive aspects to the job; especially the friends who helped pass the time, and the fact that the job was completely left behind the moment I clicked out on my timecard. But the monotony, lack of accomplishment, poor work environment and bleak future made me sure that I wanted a career with varied tasks, intellectual stimulation, responsibility, personal growth and, most of all, where my efforts can make a difference.\nMatthew O.
