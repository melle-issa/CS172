most widely used green building rating system.\nStart a project\n\nTTE Innovation Center | LEED Gold | Photo: Shigeo Ogawa\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEED-certified green buildings are better buildings.\nBuildings consume energy and resources at an alarming rate. We can do better. LEED provides a framework for healthy, efficient, carbon and cost-saving green buildings. LEED certification is a globally recognized symbol of sustainability achievement, and it is backed by an entire industry of committed organizations and individuals paving the way for market transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow LEED works\nLEED-certified buildings save money, improve efficiency, lower carbon emissions and create healthier places for people. They are critical to addressing climate change and meeting ESG goals, enhancing resilience, and supporting more equitable communities. LEED categories can also contribute toward meeting the U.N.\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. Explore synergies between LEED and SDGs.\u00a0\nTo achieve LEED certification, a project earns points by adhering to prerequisites and credits that address carbon, energy, water, waste, transportation, materials, health and indoor environmental quality. Projects go through a verification and review process by GBCI and are awarded points that correspond to a level of LEED certification: Certified (40-49 points), Silver (50-59 points), Gold (60-79 points) and Platinum (80+ points).\n\n\nPlatinum\n80+ points earned\n\n\nGold\n60-79 points earned\n\n\nSilver\n50-59 points earned\n\n\nCertified\n40-49 points earned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEED system goals\nLEED is a holistic system that doesn\u2019t simply focus on one building element, such as energy, water or health. Instead, it looks at the big picture, factoring in all critical elements that work together to create the best building possible. The goal of LEED is to create better buildings that:\n\n\nReduce contribution to\nglobal climate change\nEnhance individual human health\n\n\nProtect and restore water resources\nProtect and enhance biodiversity\nand ecosystem services\n\n\nPromote sustainable and\nregenerative material cycles\nEnhance community quality of life\n\n\nOf all LEED credits, 35% relate to climate change, 20% directly impact human health, 15% impact water resources, 10% affect biodiversity, 10% relate to the green economy, and 5% impact community and natural resources. In LEED v4.1, most LEED credits are related to operational and embodied carbon.
