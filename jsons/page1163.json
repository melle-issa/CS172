Learn more about the Integrated Master's in Food Science program at our next Zoom Information Session !\nThe food science program offers an integrated program that enables undergraduate students to begin taking M.S. coursework in their junior or senior year and receive a Master of Science in Food Science in as little as one year after finishing their undergraduate degree. The program is open to all undergraduate majors as long as they have satisfied the prerequisites for the program and meet admission requirements.\nChapman students can apply to a graduate program in their junior or senior year. Students will receive conditional admission to the program, pending completion of their bachelor's degree as stipulated in the graduate catalog (see explanation of conditional admission in the graduate catalog). If accepted into a graduate program, undergraduate students may take up to 15 graduate credits once they have completed 90 undergraduate credits. These 15 credits may also count towards their undergraduate degree credit requirement. Students would complete the remaining credit hours of graduate coursework beginning in the semester after receiving the undergraduate degree. The application process, prerequisites, GPA and graduate program requirements are as specified for the M.S. in Food Science; however letters of recommendation are waived.\n\nIntegrated BS Biology/M.S.
