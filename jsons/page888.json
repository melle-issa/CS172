Grabbed a towel\nshould he vomit again.\nAnd he didn\u2019t whistle on the way\nthat was all green lights.\n\nWhat we can all do to save my third-world country\n\nSupport the donkey show economy\nEnjoy a Nestle jar of cold jarro beans\nTaste the watermelon sweat\nSell your camera phones to wetbacks\nSign the curandera\u2019s appointment ledger\nRub your palm on this doe-eyed rosary\nSwallow little girls\u2019 citrus sweet\nPander to half moon erections\nBuy mercury bracelets\nDrink the mesquite sap off baby\u2019s fingers\nPurge the stomachs of nopales\nSuckle from my wet bedsheets\nOwn my mother\u2019s blind hands\nWitness my father\u2019s hunched back\nRead me your Alamo story\nSave me in your CK jeans and velvet cowboy hats\nSee me gnaw with teeth made of corn\nCount the cancer moles on my back\nTaste the neck of the rattlesnake\nKiss the gray waste of sexed factories\nEuthanize the silver mines\nFeed me the salty semen of your lucent gods\nPlay Mexican bingo with the ghosts of abandoned homes\n\nDrug Runner, or, Random South Texas Town\n\nHeard the men in suits\nSaid no to Target, to Best Buy,\nTo all those indoors\nWith cool-heeled bodies\nPelting you with khaki smiles\nAnd the latest trinket. Heard\nThe men in suits didn\u2019t want\nTraffic, a lit world.\nThe rich don\u2019t mind\nThe dark, don\u2019t even fear\nIt when it floats in every magic\nTheir hands tremble for,\nThe bad shit I hear makes you\nNot even want to fuck.\nI\u2019ve seen the tight heft of it\nGlisten, moonlight touching\nThe tight corners of truck beds.\nDrive it there, they say,\nAnd don\u2019t ask questions.\nAnd when the cop car twinkles\nIts lights from some bank\nsluggish with night,\nI know they like to play it like that.\nNo indoor job for me,\nNothing but the soothing silence,\nThe road past midnight,\nEverybody learning to wait.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MonthlyFeatures\n\n\n\n\nHomeHoppenthaler's CongeriesJuly 2019May 2019March 2019January 2019November 2018September 2018August 2018July 2018May 2018March 2018January 2018201720162015201220132014June 2014 July 2014August 2014 September 2014January 2014February 2014March 2014April 2014 May 2014November 2014201120102009Crazy Rabbit ReviewFeatured ArtistFeatured Guest EditorMusic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n WrittenArtists\n\n\n\n\nPoetryFictionCreative NonfictionBook ReviewWine ReviewTravel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n InformationCenter\n\n\n\n\nMission StatementPrivacy PolicyTerms of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n DonateThrough Paypal\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2022 Connotation Press | All Rights Reserved. | Site Design by Connotation Press\nAll materials contained on this site are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed,\npublished or broadcast without the prior written permission of Connotation Press or in the case of third party materials, the owner of that content.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
