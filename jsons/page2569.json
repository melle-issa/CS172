Family and friends shared remembrances of the late Aztec\u2019s fondness of all things at San Diego State University. They told stories of his relentless ambition, his illimitable humility and his motivation \u2014 his heartiest attribute of all.\u00a0\u00a0\"Hard to discourage,\" said Brown\u2019s widow\u00a0Marilyn Brown, citing a junior-year personality profile.\u00a0Brown\u2019s family\u00a0\u2014\u00a0joined by staff, faculty and students\u00a0\u2014\u00a0helped open the doors to the James Silberrad Brown Center for Artificial Intelligence on Feb. 27 during a private renaming ceremony. The center, located at the Management Information Systems Department, Fowler College of Business, will expand on its theoretical and experimental AI research supported by the\u00a0Brown family\u2019s $5 million grant.\u00a0\u201cJim was really proud of his affiliation with San Diego State and he was really grateful for the excellent education he received here,\u201d said Brown during the ceremony. \u201cThere is no better place to honor his memory and legacy than at the Fowler College of Business at San Diego State.\u201d\u00a0The grant helps establish and operate the center, will support a center director, and will form endowments for future fellowships and scholarships. The grant was awarded based on recommendations from\u00a0Marilyn Brown and Jim\u2019s daughter,\u00a0Kelly Brown, who consulted university leadership to determine funding areas that would best align with Brown\u2019s interests.\u00a0\u201cOne of our challenges is to think about how we educate students for jobs that do not yet exist,\u201d said\u00a0Dan Moshavi, Thomas and Evelyn Page Dean of the Fowler College of Business. \u201cArtificial intelligence we know is going to be on the cutting edge.\u201d\u00a0SDSU AI Lab Director and Associate Professor\u00a0Aaron Elkins\u00a0(\u201903) described the grant to his department as \u201ca vote of confidence\u201d by the Browns that SDSU researchers are value creators in the AI field.\u00a0\u201cThis center is going to provide access to some of the most advanced instruments that we can possibly have at this moment in time for our students,\u201d said Elkins, who founded the lab in 2018. \u201cThe best way that we can say thank you [to the Brown family] is to demonstrate what we're capable of doing at SDSU.\u201d\u00a0Studies and research at the center are underway. Following the ribbon cutting,\u00a0Elkins ushered groups into the AI lab where teams of students presented various projects and state-of-the-art equipment. Undergraduate and graduate students showcased some of their work in cybersecurity, mixed reality technologies, and human-robot interactions using the lab\u2019s unofficial mascot, Pepper.\u00a0David Arteaga\u00a0and\u00a0Corey Ethington, virtual reality (VR) students, demonstrated the VR lab\u2019s latest equipment including a headset with eye-tracking technology and a haptic vest that creates a sense of touch in a virtual environment. They also talked about innovations in VR applications designed to enable users to engineer product prototypes, in healthcare, and in development of immersive virtual gyms offering some forms of physical therapy.\u00a0Brown's determined spirit will linger long at the center. His story is featured on a plaque placed prominently at the center\u2019s doors reminding students to never be discouraged.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cJim's goal for this center would be for it not to be best in class but to be the best center for artificial intelligence in America, and we are confident that will happen\u2026we stand ready to help you achieve that lofty goal,\u201d said Marilyn Brown.\u00a0\u201cBecause this is affiliated with the Fowler College of Business it's appropriate to think in terms of return on investment, so here is one for the ages: In 1966, Jim received the Robert Shields scholarship and award in the sum of $200 and here we are. Well done for SDSU.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\nLatest Stories\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nEmployee Resource Group Sets Sights on a Broader ReachEngineering Professor Emeritus Makes Gift to Start SDSU Space ClubCal Coast Partnership Offers Students an Education in Financial FundamentalsWhat Stephen L.
