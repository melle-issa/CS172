Each student is provided with a campus Seawolf account. We strongly urge you to review the contents of your Seawolf account on a frequent and regular basis. Critical notifications from the University related to enrollment, academic status, and graduation will be sent to your Seawolf account. Students may forward messages from this account to an address used regularly.\u00a0See the IT webpage for instructions. \nRegistration Information\nEmail notification of upcoming registration is sent approximately two weeks before the start of registration. Registration appointments are set approximately one week before the start of registration. The calendar contains an outline of important dates and deadlines related to registration and other enrollment related activities. Reviewing your Academic Requirements Report (ARR) on a frequent and regular basis as well as meeting with your Academic Advisor will help you stay on track.\nMore in-depth information can be found in the Schedule of Classes and the Catalog.\u00a0 To review the policy on Registration Eligibility, please review the Registration Eligibility page.\nOnline Registration\nRegistration at SSU is online through your MySSU portal. Students may use MySSU to add, drop or swap classes through the end of the second week of classes in fall and spring semesters (specific closures will be noted on the calendar). Changes to your class schedule are immediate. Each semester students are assigned an Enrollment Appointment for building their class schedule and registering.\nEnrollment appointments are in order by special groups approved by the Academic Senate, then by class level, and finally by units. Once you are allowed access to registration you may continue to make changes to your schedule until the end of that registration period. During open registration and add/drop periods your access to registration is on first come, first serve basis.\nHow to Get a Seawolf ID\nIf you do not already have a Seawolf username and password, visit the Online Service: Password Tool page\u00a0to obtain one.\u00a0If you are a new applicant to SSU, please remember that the information you submit should match that on your admissions application.\nContinuing students should\u00a0use\u00a0their current Seawolf username and password.\nIf you can't remember your Seawolf username\u00a0or password, go to SSU Online Services:\u00a0Change Password.\u00a0\nRegistration Dates\nRegistration by appointment begins April 17th and ends April 21st.\u00a0\nRegistration continues April 22nd.\nFor the purpose of assigning\u00a0registration appointments, the categories of students are\u00a0defined as:\nSeniors (90 or more completed units)\nJuniors (60-89 completed units)\nSophomores (30-59 completed units)\nFreshman (0-29 completed units)\nUnit Limits\n\nUndergraduate students will be eligible to register for\u00a0up to\u00a018 units\n\n\nGraduate and credential students may register for\u00a0up to\u00a018 units\n\nWait List:\u00a012 units maximum\nRequests for more than 18 units:\nStudents who have filed for Fall 2023 graduation will have requests processed as they are received.\nAll other requests will be reviewed prior to the start of the next registration period (usually in January for Spring semester\u00a0and July for Fall semester).\nThe\u00a0maximum that may be taken in any given semester is\u00a023 units.\nLate Registration\nNo appointment\u00a0required\nLate fee applicable for first-time registrants\nIf you fail to pay your tuition fees or confirm financial aid by the University\u2019s established fee deadlines, you may lose the classes in which you are enrolled.\nRegistration Process\nLog on to MySSU, Student Center\u2028\nOnce you successfully login, it is important that you immediately check:\n\tYour registration appointment\nAny Holds\u2028\n\nDuring your assigned registration times(s) you can:\u2028\n\tAdd\u2028\nDrop\u2028\nSwap\u2028\nChange your basis of grading\u2028\n\nPay your registration fees\u2028\nHow to Register\nView the Registration 101 video\u00a0for instructions on how to add a class.
