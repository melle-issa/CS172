Argyros Endowed Chair in Finance and Economics Vernon Smith answered a range of questions following the ceremony honoring him with the first Doti-Spogli Free Enterprise Award. The prize will be given annually to a faculty member who best promotes free enterprise and was created as part of the Doti-Spogli Endowed Chair of Free Enterprise.\nThe prize and chair, which were unveiled in 2022, are named for Chapman President Emeritus Jim Doti and former U.S. Ambassador Ron Spogli.\n\u201cI feel very good about the honor,\u201d said Smith, who wore a Western bolo tie. \u201cAnd I also feel that all the socialists I grew up with in the \u201930s and \u201940s would be very surprised.\u201d\nArgyros School of Business and Economics Dean Henrik Cronqvist, left, President Emeritus Jim Doti, Professor Vernon Smith and Presidential Fellow Mark Skousen at the presentation of the first Doti-Spogli Free Enterprise Award on April 13.\nSmith, who has joint appointments in Chapman\u2019s Argyros School of Business and Economics and Fowler School of Law, received a share of the Nobel Prize in 2002 for his work in inventing experimental economics. He created Chapman\u2019s Economic Science Institute when he arrived at the university 15 years ago.\nDoti called Smith his hero when giving him the award.\n\u201cOrdinarily when you receive something like the Nobel Prize it\u2019s the culmination of a career and you ride off into the sunset. Not the case for Vernon Smith,\u201d Doti said. \u201cIn terms of bringing the institute together, he also really embodies the mission of Chapman University. And a major part of that is to get students and faculty working together.\u201d\nPresidential Fellow and Doti-Spogli Chair Mark Skousen read a letter from Spogli, who couldn\u2019t attend.\n\u201cBoth Jim and Mark have described to me your pioneering scholarship over the decades,\u201d wrote Spogli, co-founder of private equity firm Freeman Spogli & Co. \u201cWe are delighted to recognize your work and thank you for setting the bar high for future honorees.\u201d\nAfter the award presentation, Skousen asked Smith 20 questions in the classroom filled with students. Smith, 96, mixed personal observations with thoughts on philosopher and economist Adam Smith and the federal deficit, among other topics.\nSkousen asked if Vernon Smith\u2019s mother, a member of the socialist party, forgave him for abandoning socialist thought.\n\u201cShe trusted me a lot and she loved me a lot. That more than anything accounts for my success,\u201d said Smith, who grew up in Wichita, Kansas, during the Great Depression.\nResponding to the most important lesson he\u2019s learned in life, Smith said, \u201cIt really has to begin where I began. And that\u2019s to be born in a free country. Because if you\u2019re not born in a free country, it\u2019s likely to be tough.\u201d\nSmith, who called himself an \u201cincurable optimist,\u201d said he and the people he grew up with were never raised with the idea that they were limited because of the modesty of their circumstances.\n\u201cThey prospered and that\u2019s of course the reason why the whole country prospered, because people are prospering,\u201d he said.\nSkousen asked Smith about the first paper he submitted to a prominent journal on his \u201cdouble auction\u201d experiment, which would later win him the Nobel Prize. The paper initially got two negative peer reports, which Smith rebutted.\n\u201cThe editor sent it out for two more referee reports. And they were negative,\u201d he said.\nThe editor asked Smith what he thought about the negative reviews, and Smith told him.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t know what they were talking about,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBecause we\u2019re about experiments \u2013 that wasn\u2019t part of economics. In fact, that was an argument against the paper \u2026 The important thing about that paper and the fact that other people could replicate it is not some kind of a miracle. It was very easy.\u201d\nAfter this year, the Doti-Spogli prize committee will consider honoring people outside Chapman.\nAdditionally, the Doti-Spogli chair will recognize a student who writes the best paper promoting free enterprise. This year\u2019s paper topic is \u201cCalifornia Dreaming: What can be done to bring back business to the Golden State?\u201d\n\n\nArgyros School Argyros School of Business and Economics Doti-Spogli Chair in Free-Enterprise Dr. Vernon L.
