The time and schedule have not yet been announced but registration is open.\nAttendees can expect to see demos of Human Made\u2019s current AI projects and highlights of what others are doing in the space. The organizers plan to discuss the impact AI will have on the WordPress industry and share predictions and insights.\nHuman Made is among a few WordPress product makers that have been experimenting with Gutenberg-native AI block and content assistants. CTO Joe Hoyle published several videos demonstrating how prompts can work across various blocks with AI natively integrated into the block editor. His prototypes have progressed with the addition of Content Streaming that renders content, blocks, and layout in real time. Users can also cancel the streaming output while it\u2019s in progress to refine the guidance given to the AI.\n\nWe've made some progress on the WordPress Gutenberg AI integration.

WPfront.page is tracking more than three dozen AI products that have popped up in the last few months, so there is no shortage of developers experimenting. Organizers will announce more speakers and sessions ahead of the event on May 25.\nCategory: NewsShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Like thisLike Loading\u2026\n\n5\n\n\n\n\t\t5 responses to \u201cHuman Made to Host AI for WordPress Event on May 25, 2023\u201d\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Neo says: \n\nApril 28, 2023 at 12:50 AM \n\n\nSound interesting. I hope it will show something more practical, not just ideas.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Sally G. says: \n\nApril 28, 2023 at 2:11 AM \n\n\nHow to turn off potential registrants: not accepting e-mail addresses from aol.com or protonmail.com.\nI was skeptical anyway, not sure I wanted to register, so the decision was made for me.  However, it also means that I will soft-boycott Human Made (i.e., I wasn\u2019t using their products anyway, may not have, but now will deliberately choose another option.)\nYes, I am an amateur; yes, I maintain or comaintain 4 WordPress sites.  No, I will never be a big-budget customer.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n jay chuck mailen says: \n\nApril 28, 2023 at 8:51 AM \n\n\nWell, it\u2019s understandable that you are frustrated that your email provider is not supported.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that many companies, including Human Made, have legitimate reasons for not allowing certain email providers due to issues such as security concerns or a higher likelihood of bounced or spam emails.\nThat being said, it\u2019s unfortunate that this decision has led you to boycott their products. We\u2019ve been keeping a close eye on them lately and what we\u2019ve discovered is that they seem to value all potential customers and are working hard to bring some amazing tech to the industry.\nI would encourage you to perhaps explore alternative email providers that are supported. You don\u2019t have to use aol or pronto, but you should at least try and understand the issues those services can cause companies.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that being an amateur or not having a big budget shouldn\u2019t make you any less important to them, their track record thus far supports that.\nI\u2019m just a third party dev that works for a company that has been watching Human Made and what they\u2019re up to and what we\u2019ve seen thus far might just be worth getting a gmail for, especially for a novice wanting to embrace some world changing tech.\nps \u2013 this response was written (mostly) by Fred, the F.reaking R.emarkable E.ngagement D.evice and ultimate marketing expert, powered by ChatGPT 3.5\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Brin Wilson says: \n\nApril 28, 2023 at 3:43 AM \n\n\nHiya, I can\u2019t find the doc \u201c76 ways AI could transform WordPress\u201d.
