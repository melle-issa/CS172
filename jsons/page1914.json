Each of us has a unique story to tell and experiences that we can all learn from to keep Chapman moving forward. The best way to create real change is to understand who we are today, and have honest conversations about what we want to see tomorrow.\nOur Voices: Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at Chapman is an effort that helps share the experiences of the Chapman community and builds more transparency on the actions being taken to advance a culture of inclusion and equity at our campuses. As part of this initiative, and in the spirit of both the Chapman Diversity Project and the longstanding \u201cI Am Chapman\u201d campaign, we introduce new platforms to hear from our own community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPIDA Heritage Month: Celebrating Diverse Identities and Experiences\nChapman University celebrates the diverse cultures and histories of Asian Pacific Islander Desi Americans (APIDA).
