The Core Development Team builds WordPress. features. We\u2019re excited to announce that most of this work is now complete, and there are ample opportunities to get involved in shaping the future.\u00a0\nWhat\u2019s Changed?\nThe following Jetpack features have been removed from the WordPress app and are now only available in the Jetpack app:\nStats\nReader\nNotifications\nActivity Log\nBackup\nSharing (Jetpack Social)\nJetpack blocks (BlockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. Editor)\n@-Mentions and Crossposting (Block Editor)\nIn addition, core features that relied on the WordPress.comWordPress.com An online implementation of WordPress code that lets you immediately access a new WordPress environment to publish your content.  WordPress.com is a private company owned by Automattic that hosts the largest multisite in the world. This is arguably the best place to start blogging if you have never touched WordPress before. https://wordpress.com/ APIAPI An API or Application Programming Interface is a software intermediary that allows programs to interact with each other and share data in limited, clearly defined ways., including People, Themes, and Menus, have been removed from WordPress.com and Jetpack-connected sites. (These features have never been available to self-hosted users without a Jetpack connection from the WordPress app.) Placeholders of Jetpack-powered features will remain in the app for some period of time to allow for a transition for users of these features.\nThere is still some work to be done, particularly with login, which we knew would take some time to decouple. The WordPress.com REST APIREST API The REST API is an acronym for the RESTful Application Program Interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. It is how the front end of an application (think \u201cphone app\u201d or \u201cwebsite\u201d) can communicate with the data store (think \u201cdatabase\u201d or \u201cfile system\u201d) https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/. still authenticates WordPress.com users, and these users should have the option to use the WordPress app if desired. The mobile team will continue to work on this challenge with the aim of eventually removing this dependency.\nHowever, with many Jetpack-specific features now removed, we\u2019re ready to look to the future of the WordPress app.\u00a0\nOne of the goals behind refocusing the app was always to enable larger involvement from the community, and we look forward to seeing all the great contributions and developments that will come from this decision.\u00a0\nHow to Get Involved\nDo you want to help shape the future of the WordPress mobile app? Here\u2019s how you can contribute and make a difference:\nWrite and submit code. If you\u2019re a developer, you can contribute to the app\u2019s codebase by submitting pull requests through GitHubGitHub GitHub is a website that offers online implementation of git repositories that can easily be shared, copied and modified by other developers. Public repositories are free to host, private repositories require a paid subscription. GitHub introduced the concept of the \u2018pull request\u2019 where code changes done in branches by contributors can be reviewed and discussed before being merged be the repository owner.  https://github.com/:\nWordPress for iOS is ~80% Swift, with Objective C making up some parts of the codebase.\nWordPress for Android is written in Kotlin (~66%) and Java (~34%).\nIf ReactReact React is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to reason about, construct, and maintain stateless and stateful user interfaces. https://reactjs.org/. Native is your jam, you could consider contributing to the editing experience in both apps with Mobile Gutenberg.\nTest and review new features. Fortnightly calls for testing are posted to this blog, with steps you can take to participate.\u00a0\nReport bugs. This can be done through the WordPress for Android, WordPress for iOS, or Gutenberg GitHub repositories. If you\u2019re unsure where to file your report, you can get guidance in the #mobile channel on SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform https://slack.com/. The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at https://make.wordpress.org/chat/. or add your comment to the fortnightly calls for testing.\u00a0\nSuggest or design new features. If you want to get further involved in the app\u2019s design, check out the #design channel on Slack and follow +design.\nOpen GitHub tickets with your proposals for the path forward.\nTranslate the app. If you\u2019re fluent in a language other than English, you can help by translating the app so more people can use it.\nHelp others. You can answer questions and help others in the new WordPress mobile app\u2019s support forum.\nHave questions? Not sure how to contribute? Comment on this post or ask in the Slack #mobile channel. We\u2019re excited to continue building something great together!\u00a0\nLogin to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonny Harris\n\n7:32 am on April 12, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nIs there anything that can be done to the rest apiREST API The REST API is an acronym for the RESTful Application Program Interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

Are these being used? Is there anything else the rest api team can do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Von Schrottky\n\n7:57 pm on April 19, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nThese are great questions! \nThere were the blockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor.

The editor improves the process and experience of creating new content, making writing rich content much simpler. It uses \u2018blocks\u2019 to add richness rather than shortcodes, custom HTML etc. https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/ Mobile\u2019s focus areas: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38407. \nWas there an additional use for this when it was added?\napplication passwords\nI chatted with @jkmassel about this the other day.
