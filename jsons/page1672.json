Make sure your clients are covered with their store taxes.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWell, it looks like until I get this Friday show in the groove and more people know about the opportunity, you will be listening to just myself. But good news, I do have a guest for next week. So hang in there.\nWPSpeakers.com\nSince I am riding solo here I thought I would take this opportunity to share a cool project that my friend Michelle Frechette has released, WPSpeakers.com. Now hear me out here. As a WooCommerce builder or an extended WordPress builder, opportunities to share your insights and knowledge at events is a gold mine. And I know the community is hungry to hear new voices. That's apparent from our show. Think of all the opportunities. As things go back to in-real-life events there are WordCamps, meetups and other focused gatherings that are ripe for your voice and your story.\nAnd what better way to kick it off then to add your name to Michelle's new site. And as the site says,\n\nWP Speakers is a free database of speakers available for WordPress meetups, WordCamps, and other events. If you\u2019re a speaker \u2013 join the database. Whether speaking in person to a local meetup or online to a group halfway around the world, sharing your WordPress knowledge is an amazing thing!\u00a0Join our database for free. Let organizers find you. Speak at their events!\u00a0Add your bio, headshot, location, topics, and expertise.\n\nLooking for speakers\nSomeone that responded to Michelle on Twitter said what a great idea this was. And added that with everyone moving around these days, this could make it much easier to find speakers for event organizers. Yes, that is the other huge plus of this site. It's going to make it so much easier for those who put on events to be able to, either find someone specific with an expertise, expand the diversity of your speaker lineup, or peruse the talent out there.\n\nIf you\u2019re organizing an event \u2013 search and get in touch with potential speakers. WordPress is universal. No matter where you are, your event needs speakers that can relate to your WordPress audience. \u00a0Search our database to find speakers who may be available for your online or in-person event. \u00a0Search by location, topics, and expertise.\n\nSo what are you waiting for.\nNow I'm not through yet.\nIf you are looking for other options, Michelle and Allie\u00a0Simmons\u00a0also have Underrepresented in Tech, that goes beyond just speaking gigs but is a great resource.. Plus, did you know there is a Diverse Speaker Support channel on the Make.WordPress Slack.\nIt may be your time to starting speaking\nWhether you are a seasoned speaker, or just starting, all of these resources are valuable. As a Woo builder, I just know you have a story and insights to share with the world. And if you are a bundle of nerves when it comes to speaking publicly, we have all been there. I remember in my previous life of running a design and marketing business, Judy and I joined the local Chamber of Commerce to help promote ourselves. One of the events they had were networking breakfasts which was a room of tables of 6 or 8 people to get to know each other over breakfast.\nHow it worked was you would go around the room, each person had to stand up where they were setting, and introduce themselves. I would count down as it got closer and closer to me. My blood pressure would go up. My face would start turning red. I may have even felt like puking up my breakfast. But somehow I got through and over the years, things because easier as I forced myself to grow to a comfort level from those moments to speaking at conferences.\nAnd yes, there is still always a bit of nervousness that flitters about even now when I get ready to speak to a crowd.\nA WordCamp speaker story\nThere is one more story I would like to share. Years ago at a WordCamp someone who was starting to get known in the community and would become a household name in WordPress was getting ready to present. I found him sitting against the wall, on the floor, counting the tiles. I knew him pretty well so I sat down and asked how it was going. He simply said something like, \"I am presenting for the first time. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm so nervous. I'm freaking out.\"\nWell, words sometimes are too easy to share and I tried my best to help calm him down. I reassured him that he was an expert dev, and he just need to share his knowledge. I also added that the community is a very forgiving group of people and that they are not there for a star, but hungry to learn. I said that if for any reason you need to pause, you mess up a little bit, just move on. No one really notices most of this except for yourself.\nThe time came and he went to give his talk. I went and did a few things that I needed to do and came back towards the end. He was moving right along and when he was finished, I found a good friend leaving his talk. She was a professor at University of Washington and taught programming. I casually said hi to here and asked her how the talk was.\nParaphrased she said something like this. \"He was great. A little nervous but his talk was packed with valuable information. He knows his stuff and given time he will ace it.\"\nLater I found him and share that bit of info with him. He smiled. And since then has done many, many presentations.\nWell, I got a little sidetracked there with a couple of stories. And trust me, I have a lot more. But for now I do want to swing back and give a final plug for Michelle's WPSpeakers.com. And I will add the note that Do the Woo has become a founding sponsor of her efforts, as this perfectly falls into place of what we are all about here, and that's elevating Woo and WordPress builder voices. So go forth and get your name on that site at WPSpeakers.com.\nAnd if you are interested in being a guest co-host on this show, just ping me here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThanks to our Pod Friends for their support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\u2190 Previous Post\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPodcast\nWooBits\nBlog\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nDev Resources\nBuilder Meetup\nDo the Woo News\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to WooBits\nSponsor\nChangelog\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPartners\nContact\nAbout\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMenu \nHome\nPrivacy Policy\nDisclaimer\nTerms of Service\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDotheWoo.io does not have any affiliate links.
