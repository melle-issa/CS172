But this time, a great idea came straight from the hip, which is where she was carrying her then-2-year-old daughter, Millie.\n\u201cOne day she laughed and said, \u2018Ha, ha, Mama has a mustache,\u2019\u201d recalls Rubin, Chapman University professor and acclaimed director of feature-length documentaries such as \u201cHillbilly\u201d and \u201cDeep Down.\u201d \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018Oh, I have to make a movie to fit that title.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cMama Has a Mustache: Kids Talk Gender\u201d is a lovingly quirky 10-minute documentary featuring audio interviews with a diverse group of young children. In their own charming words, the youngsters reflect on identity and family outside the traditional gender binary.\nDirector Sally Rubin is her element with kids at the HollyShorts Film Festival.\nThe young voices combine with animated clip art and mixed media \u201cto explore and uncover this exciting new frontier \u2013 with lightness, humor, childlike openness and play,\u201d as Rubin says in her director\u2019s statement for the film.\nIt\u2019s particularly exciting for Rubin that the conversations are just getting started. Her film has been picked up by a major streaming service, which for contract reasons she can\u2019t name yet. But she can share that the media company has plans for an additional series of short films in which Rubin interviews youngsters about race, religion, bullying and other subjects.\nFilm\u2019s Inspiration Comes From Rubin\u2019s Personal Experience\nRubin was inspired to make \u201cMama Has a Mustache\u201d \u201cas someone who identifies as nonbinary but who decided to be pregnant and have a kid,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to look at this new gender frontier, especially as I\u2019ve been meeting and working with Chapman students who more and more are identifying not just as transgender but as nonbinary.\u201d\nRubin has long involved her Dodge College of Film and Media Arts students in her process by showing them rough cuts and inviting their critique. This cycle, she compared notes with students as fellow filmmakers \u2013 \u201cas they were working on their cuts, I was working on mine,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s nice for students in any discipline to have a professor who is actively creating new work and is in the trenches with them.\u201d\nThe reception for her latest film, by her students and the film festival-going public, \u201chas been way better than I could have imagined,\u201d Rubin says. \u201cMama\u201d has screened at more than 25 festivals, from Outfest to the Oscar-qualifying New York International Children\u2019s Film Festival to the San Francisco International Film Festival and, most recently, MountainFilm in Telluride, Colo.\nObservations Are \u201cHonest, Hilarious and Always Straight From the Heart\u201d\nIndieWire called \u201cMama\u201d one of 10 must-see films shown at Outfest. Reviewer Jude Dry calls the children\u2019s observations about growing up with trans and gender-nonconforming parents \u201chonest, hilarious and always straight from the heart.\u201d\nOf Rubin, Dry writes that \u201cMama Has a Mustache\u201d \u201cmarks a more playful but just as vital side to Rubin\u2019s work.\u201d\nAfter conducting more than 40 interviews for her feature-length 2018 documentary \u201cHillbilly,\u201d which to a great extent traces the origins of the current rural-urban divide in America, Rubin was ready to show her playful side.\n\u201cAfter \u2018Hillbilly,\u2019 I definitely wanted to offer the world something that\u2019s fun and playful but still gets people thinking,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was really fun to dive into animation without knowing anything about it.\u201d\nNow the impact of \u201cMama Has a Mustache\u201d has a chance to grow even more.\nThanks to Chapman scholarly research and outreach grants, as well as support from the New England Foundation for Psychoanalysis, the Perspective Fund, Chicken and Egg, and private donors, Rubin and her team have created a teaching toolkit and discussion guide for use in classrooms and at conferences on education, child development, psychology and gender studies.\nAs \u201cMama Has a Mustache\u201d sparks a dialogue about gender identity, Rubin acknowledges that other forces \u2013 in legislatures, on social media and elsewhere \u2013 are pushing back against a nonbinary understanding of gender.\nBring on that conversation, too, Rubin says.\n\u201cControversy is great,\u201d the filmmaker adds. \u201cNot everyone has to feel like I do, or like the kids in the movie do. I understand that people have very strong opinions about how kids should be raised. I just want \u2018Mama Has a Mustache\u2019 to be out there as an option for parents and school systems to decide.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nChapman in Hollywood \n\n\n\n\n \n\nDennis Arp \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoss and Matt Duffer \u201907, Hannah Einbinder \u201917 Earn Primetime Emmy Nominations\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Film Student Takes Industry OnRamp to Breakthrough at Tribeca Festival\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Canogar\u2019s \u201cPareidolia\u201d Multimedia Artwork Unveiled at Chapman University On April 13, the Phyllis and Ross Escalette Permanent Collection of Art in Wilkinson College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences unveiled its newest artwork installation, \u201cPareidolia,\u201d by internationally renowned...\n\n\nApril 27, 2023 Staci Dumoski\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman University Appoints Athina Cuevas as Assistant Director of Promising Futures First-Generation Program and Cross-Cultural Center Chapman University\u2019s Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) named Athina Cuevas assistant director of the Promising Futures First-Generation Program and Cross-Cultural Center.
