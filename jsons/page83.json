interest in financial aid has no bearing on admission decisions.\nFurthermore, we work with families to meet the full demonstrated financial need for students who satisfy all deadlines and eligibility requirements.\nMore than 75 percent of aid is in the form of gift aid\u2014money that doesn\u2019t need to be repaid. This includes need-based grants and scholarships from all sources.\n\nTo see your financial aid summary, visit your Financial Aid Summary and Tasks (FAST) page, available in the navigation bar at the top of this page.\n\nHow Financial Aid Works\nWe use available funds from federal, state and university sources to meet your full USC-determined financial need. Your eligibility is based on two factors: the Cost of Attendance and your Expected Family Contribution, as calculated by USC.\nPlease see the How Aid Works page for more information.\n\n\n\n\nWho Receives Financial Aid?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTOOLBOX\n\n\n\nFinancial Aid Calculators\nSubmit Documents\nScholarship Universe\nTips & Resources\nFAQ\nSALT\nLog In to FAST\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\nHow-to Videos\n\n\n\nHow Financial Aid Works\n\t\t\t\t    \t\t    This video will introduce you to the basics of qualifying, applying for, and receiving financial aid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancing Your USC Education\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  This presentation covers scholarships, grants, on-campus employment, and low-interest loans, including eligibility and application procedures.
