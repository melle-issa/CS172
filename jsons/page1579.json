With a tradition of promoting intellectual and personal growth, leadership opportunities and technological proficiency, SSU offers its students a friendly, safe and informal atmosphere on a beautiful campus setting.

With 34 percent of the student body living on campus, it is one of the most residential campuses within the California State University system.\nAcademic Profile\u00a0\nAccreditation\u00a0\nAlumni Association\nAthletics\nAwards and\u00a0Honors\nBuildings and\u00a0Learning Center\nDegree/Program Offerings\nEthnicity Profile\nFounders\nGreek Life and Campus Clubs\u00a0\nHousing\nRegional Resource\nStudent Life\nAcademic Profile\nThe SSU educational experience fosters intellectual, cognitive, social and personal growth.
