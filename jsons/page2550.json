Out-of-state tuition fees are higher than in-state tuition fees. Just because a student is or has been a resident of the State of California does not mean that he or she qualifies to receive the in-state tuition rate. Certain requirements, established under California law, must be met.\nYour campus admissions office will make the determination of residency status based on the information you provide, including information provided on the Application for Admission and/or the CSU Residence Questionnaire. You must contact the campus to receive a final determination of residency status. \nIt is the responsibility of the student to verify all fee balances prior to the start of the term. Out-of-state tuition will be charged if the student did not meet the residency or Non-Resident Tuition Exemption (AB540) requirements. If a student paid out-of-state tuition in previous terms, the CSU is unable to grant retroactive requests or change residency status as evidence of California residency was not provided to the campus by the stated deadlines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPTWCO\n\n\nPublishing Top Two Column 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing Top Two Column 3\n\n\nPublishing Top Two Column 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing Top Three Column 1\n\n\nPublishing Top Three Column 2\n\n\nPTTCT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing Middle One ColumnWhich Type of Student Are You?\nStart here: Are you a new or continuing CSU student?\n\n\nNewStudents \nApplies to all new CSU applicants, including first-time freshmen, transfer students, and new graduate students.\n\n\u200bContinuingStudents\nApplies to students who arealready enrolled at the CSU.After you\u2019ve determined whether you are a new or continuing student, find additional residency resources for students with these unique circumstances.\nFoster YouthGraduate StudentsInternational StudentsMilitary & DependentsStudents Under 19Undocumented Students \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing Middle Two Column 1\n\n\nPublishing Middle Two Column 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing Middle Two Column 3\n\n\nPublishing Middle Two Column 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing Middle Three Column 1\n\n\nPublishing Middle Three Column 2\n\n\nPublishing Middle Three Column 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing Bottom One ColumnExceptions & Exemptions Students not classified as California residents for tuition purposes may qualify for an exception or exemption (e.g., AB 540, military exceptions).\nLearn Whether You Qualify\u00a0 Mandatory Fee WaiversCSU offers Mandatory Fee Waivers for qualifying students (e.g., Alan Pattee \u2013 spouse/child of active law enforcement/fire killed in the line of duty, CalVet Fee Waiver). \nLearn About Fee Waivers Filing a Residency AppealAny student may submit an online\u00a0appeal of their residence classification within 30 days, but\u00a0ONLY\u00a0if certain criteria are met. \nLearn About Appeals Financial Aid Learn about financial aid resources, and find out whether you should fill out the FAFSA or the Dream Act form\nSee Financial Aid ResourcesResidency FormsThese documents enable you to share information about your residency status, file an appeal and more.\nFind the\u00a0Forms You Need Free Immigration Services Free immigration legal services are available\u00a0at every CSU campus for students, faculty, staff, their immediate family (spouses, parents, siblings, and children), and alumni (up to 2 years after graduating).\u200b \nFind \u200bLegal Support Services \u200b\u200bCampus Residency Information Each campus admissions office is responsible for determining the residency status of all new and returning students. \nChoose a CampusBakersfieldChannel IslandsChico Dominguez Hills East BayFresno \nFullertonHumboldt Long BeachLos AngelesMaritimeMonterey BayNorthridgePomona \n Sacramento (Initial Residency) Sacramento (Reclassification)San BernardinoSan Diego \nSan FranciscoSan Jos\u00e9 San Luis ObispoSan MarcosSonomaStanislaus \nGo \n\n \u200b \n\u200b\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing Bottom Two Column 1\n\n\nPublishing Bottom Two Column 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublishing Bottom Two Column 3\n\n\nPublishing Bottom Two Column 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPBTCO\n\n\nPBTCW\n\n\nPBTCT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttend\nCampusesDegrees, Certificates & CredentialsAdmissionsPaying for CollegeFreshmanTransferGraduateInternationalStudent ServicesCounselor Resources\nImpact of the CSU\nDiversityStudent SuccessTeacher and Educator PreparationResearchBusiness & EconomySustainabilityTechnologyAlumniGovernmentCommunity\nThe CSU System\nAbout the CSUGraduation Initiative 2025Why the CSU MattersLeadershipFaculty & StaffAdministrationAuxiliary OrganizationsCSU BudgetData InsightsDoing Business with the CSUTransparency & Accountability\nResource Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply\nDonate\nNews\nCareers\nContact\n\n\n\nCalifornia State UniversityOffice of the Chancellor\n401 Golden Shore\n\t                                    Long Beach CA 90802\n(562) 951-4000\nMaps and Directions\nAccessibility\nTitle IX\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\u2039\n\n\t\t\t\t\u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
