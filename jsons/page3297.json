Rather, our goal is to make every experience,\n                        whether in person or digital accessible to all\u00a0at the point of creation, and in doing so, demonstrate one of our core values: that\n                        all people share equal rights to learn, work, and connect.\u00a0\nWhat is Digital Accessibility?\n\nDigital Accessibility is achieved when\u00a0all people\u00a0can equitably access content on\n                        the web or in applications.\u00a0\nMany of the applications we use\u00a0to communicate, collaborate, and share\u00a0enable\u00a0accessibility, but access for all\u00a0doesn't happen by default. Everyone who shares content\n                        in a digital format (course sites, websites, email, documents, presentations, etc.)\n                        must take action to create\u00a0an equitable experience for all.\n\nFor questions related to accessibility at SDSU, contact [email\u00a0protected].\n\u00a0\n\n\nAccessibility Core Skills\n\n\n\nAcessible Digital Materials\n\n\n\nDesigning for Accessibility\n\n\n\nTools & Evaluations\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessible PDFs\n\n\n\nAccessible Video\n\n\n\nAccessible Canvas Course\n\n\n\nAccessibility at the CSU \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5500 Campanile DriveSan Diego, CA 92182Phone: 619-594-5200\n\nA-Z IndexCampus DirectoryMapsParkingEmploymentMedia RelationsGive to SDSUWebPortalGeneral ContactNetwork StatusStrategic PlanNewsletter Sign Up\n\n\n\n\nCopyright\u00a0\u00a9\u00a02021 San Diego State UniversityRequires SDSUid indicates links which require an SDSUid.AccessibilitySDSU Digital Privacy StatementFeedback\u00a0Document Reader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Updated 4/3/23\n",
