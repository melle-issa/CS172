At SDSU tens of thousands\n                        of small donations have collectively funded programs that can be sustained over a\n                        long period of time.

Generous donor support opens doors to opportunities,\n                        inspires excellence, ignites discovery and delivers promise to students by making\n                        an education possible. Donors are changing lives. Your charitable gift will empower\n                        students to finish what they set out to do.\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\nGreat Institution With The Best Minds\nEndowed chairs and professorships are rewarding. Funding supports the recruitment\n                        of internationally recognized faculty who will have a transformational impact on students,\n                        build excellence throughout SDSU and grow nationally-ranked programs. These legacy\n                        gifts send a message of commitment to academic excellence.\n                     \n\n\n\nExpressing Passion and Interest\nConvey your personal passion or your company's mission with a gift to SDSU. There\n                        is satisfaction in supporting an important cause and the excitement of seeing your\n                        gift lead to tangible benefits. The impact you or your company make, can be transformational\n                        and your investment ensures a meaningful return.\n                     \n\n\n\n\n\nAchieving Long-Term Prestige\nThe naming of a college, department or program provides one of the ultimate vehicles\n                        for assuring long-term program excellence. Endowments of such magnitude enable programs\n                        to sustain national stature. A naming gift to SDSU is a vote of confidence in our\n                        vision and helps us maximize our potential.\n                     \n\n\n\nA Lasting Legacy\nThousands of SDSU students have benefitted from legacy giving brought about by a planned\n                        gift. A gift in your will, trust or estate plan ensures a consistent, long-term source\n                        of funding for campus-wide academic programs and initiatives.
