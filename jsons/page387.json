The creative supplement is usually reviewed by the department that you are applying for.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNov 2nd, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen in app\nFacebook\nTweet\nReddit\nMail\nEmbed\nPermalink \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous asked:\n\nHey!

If I apply ED, and am offered a major that wasn\u2019t on my application, would I still be required to attend?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi, thank you for reaching out! We recommend you reach out to your admission counselor for specific questions like this one!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOct 28th, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen in app\nFacebook\nTweet\nReddit\nMail\nEmbed\nPermalink \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymous asked:\n\nI am finishing up my EA application now.
