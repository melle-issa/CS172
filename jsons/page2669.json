After completing his formal education after eighth grade, Ch\u00e1vez worked the fields full time to help support his family. Farm life in the mid-20th century was noted for hardships and injustices. Ch\u00e1vez began his career in community organizing in 1952 when he was recruited and trained by Fred Ross, a legendary community organizer.\nWorking tirelessly for the rights of farmworkers and immigrants, Ch\u00e1vez co-founded the National Farm Workers Association in 1962 in collaboration with Dolores Huerta, which became the first successful farm workers union in the United States. Moreover, Ch\u00e1vez was a champion for nonviolent social change, education and consumer rights.\n\u201cOnce social change begins, it cannot be reversed,\u201d said Ch\u00e0vez. \u201cYou cannot uneducate the person who has learned to read. You cannot humiliate the person who feels pride. You cannot oppress the people who are not afraid anymore.\u201d\nC\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Day provides a time to reflect on Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s efforts to promote social justice and to renew a commitment to his ideals of nonviolence and unity. His legacy continues to inspire people to work toward creating a more equitable society for all.\nChapman honors C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Day by observance on Friday, March 24, and the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion will host a reception to celebrate Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s legacy in Latinx and Hispanic communities. The reception will be held at the Cross-Cultural Center on Friday, March 31, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Stephany Cuevas, assistant professor at Attallah College of Educational Studies, will discuss C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez during the event.\n\n\nCesar Chavez Day DEI \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFresh Food is Served for Students Observing Ramadan, Passover\n\n\n\n\n\nLiterary Therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman University Appoints Athina Cuevas as Assistant Director of Promising Futures First-Generation Program and Cross-Cultural Center Chapman University\u2019s Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) named Athina Cuevas assistant director of the Promising Futures First-Generation Program and Cross-Cultural Center.
