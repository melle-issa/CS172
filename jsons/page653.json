To achieve these goals, websites often implement marketing campaigns. One tactic that marketers use for these marketing campaigns is creating countdown timers.   Countdown timers in web design are digital timers that display the remaining time until a particular event or deadline. In this article, we\u2019ll discuss how you can use countdown timers to boost your marketing campaigns. Why use countdown timers in my campaigns? Countdown timers are a great tool for marketing campaigns if used properly. Research has shown that using a countdown timer can increase conversion rates. Here are some reasons why countdown timers can make your marketing campaigns more effective: Sense of Urgency Having a countdown timer encourages website visitors to take action before time runs out. It will give them motivation to fulfill a goal you\u2019ve set for your website, whether it is to sign up for a newsletter, make a purchase, or completing an action that will be beneficial to the website visitor and your business. Increase Engagement Countdown timers can also help to increase engagement with your marketing campaign by creating a sense of excitement and anticipation. You can do this by promising a valuable opportunity by the end of a countdown. As an example, when you have a timer counting down until the launch of a product or a sale, it may have your website visitors eagerly waiting for the countdown to reach zero. This may cause them to explore your website more while waiting for the end of the countdown. Increase Conversion By leveraging scarcity, countdown timers can ultimately lead to an increase in your website\u2019s conversion rates. Customers will more likely take action when they feel that they must act quickly to avoid missing out on a valuable opportunity. When you create a sense of exclusivity, it will encourage customers to make the desired action before a timer runs out.  What type of marketing campaigns can i use countdown timers for? There are a variety of marketing campaigns that you can use countdown timers for. However, it\u2019s important to make sure that the timer is relevant to the promotion or event and that it is not overused, as customers may get used to the sense of urgency it creates. Here are some types of marketing campaigns in which countdown timers can be effective: Limited-Time Promotions You can take advantage of countdown timers for limited-time promotions, flash sales, or seasonal offers, like say during a Black Friday or New Year\u2019s Eve sale. By using countdown timers for limited-time promotions, you can increase the number of purchases made during the promotion period. Product Launches You can create a countdown timer for a product launch or even a website launch. By starting the countdown several days or weeks before the launch date, you can generate buzz and excitement, and encourage customers to sign up for email alerts or follow your social media channels for updates. Event Registrations Countdown timers can also be effective in promoting events and encouraging registrations. By highlighting the number of days or hours left until the event, you can create a sense of urgency and encourage customers to register before it\u2019s too late. How to create a countdown timer? It\u2019s important to choose the right countdown timer for your marketing campaign. There are many options available, especially when you\u2019re a WordPress user\u2013from free plugins to paid services, so it\u2019s essential to choose a countdown timer that is easy to install and customize for your website. We suggest checking out Stackable (of course). It\u2019s the ultimate block plugin for the WordPress editor. Our very own Countdown Block has a lot of design controls that make it easy for you to match it with your website. Let us show you how easy it is to add a countdown timer and customize it to fit the rest of your website. Here\u2019s an example of a Pricing page without a countdown timer. It has all the typical sections of a Pricing page but if you notice in the video below, it\u2019s currently having a sale. It\u2019s not really obvious that it\u2019s for a limited time only and a website visitor won\u2019t have any information on when it will end. We should first set a clear goal. The goal could be to increase sales, gain more subscribers, or create brand awareness. But for this page, our goal is to increase sales, to do that, we must create a sense of urgency.  We want to place the countdown timer strategically. An area where it is visible and obvious to customers but where it will not interfere with the customer\u2019s shopping experience. Let\u2019s place it at the top, right before the Pricing section. Let\u2019s first add a Columns / Container block at the top of the Page Content.   In the Layout picker, we\u2019re choosing the 30 / 70 option where there will be one inner column that takes up 30% of the page width, and another taking up 70% of the page width.  Now, let\u2019s make the whole Columns / Container block full width.  Now, we\u2019ll add in some content on the leftmost column. These are added using Stackable\u2019s Heading and Text blocks. For the copy, it\u2019s important to use persuasive language to motivate your customers to act quickly. For example, \u201cDon\u2019t miss out!\u201d or \u201cLast chance to buy!\u201d. So we made sure to include that in the copy of our countdown timer section to cause some sense of urgency.   After that, on the rightmost column, let\u2019s now add the Countdown block.  Here is how it looks like so far! It looks pretty bland and doesn\u2019t really match the website\u2019s design and aesthetics yet. So we should customize it a bit more.  First, let\u2019s make the block\u2019s content Align Wide by selecting the middle option of the Content Width. You can find this option in Style > General > Content Width.   Now, let\u2019s add a background to our block. While with the whole Columns / Container block selected, go to Block > Background and click the toggle to turn it on.  Now, let\u2019s add a color to this whole block using the Background Color control. We\u2019ve selected this custom minty green in the color picker.   Now, let\u2019s customize the text inside the left inner column. We\u2019ve used the Rubik font for the Font Family and set the Font Weight to 300.  Once that\u2019s done, let\u2019s move on to designing the countdown block. Under the Style Tab, you will find various Settings panels, and the first one is the General panel. It is where you will be able to select what date you want the timer to end. Here, we\u2019ve selected April 5, 2023 and the time to 12:00 am.  Scrolling down the General panel, you will find the control where you can set the timezone the timer will follow. We\u2019ve selected the Local Timezone option so that it follows the timezone that the user is on, wherever they are in the world. We\u2019ve also set the Action on Expiration to Display Message Upon Expiration so that when the timer ends, we are able to display a message for the website visitor. We\u2019ll add that message later on.  The next panel in the Style tab of the Countdown block is the Digits panel where we will be able to customize the numbers in the countdown timer. We\u2019ve set the Typography settings to Rubik font, and the weight to 700.  The next panel is called Labels. It is where we will be able to design how the labels under each number will appear. In the image below, we\u2019ve set the typography to the Radley font, Uppercase transform, and Italic font style.  Next is the Container Background. We\u2019ve clicked the toggle to turn it on and set the Background Color Opacity to 0.4. This will make the containers of each digit appear like the other containers in the page.  Now, let\u2019s add some borders to finish the complete look of the containers. We\u2019ve selected the Solid option in the Borders control and set the Border Radius to 20.  Finally, let\u2019s add an expired message! We\u2019ve added the text: \u201cSale finished! Thanks for participating!\u201c  Now we\u2019re done with our very own countdown timer section for this pricing page. Let\u2019s see how that looks in the frontend.  That looks great! We\u2019ve covered all bases\u2013we\u2019ve placed it strategically, aligned it with the page\u2019s goal/objective, and created a sense of urgency. Now, all that\u2019s left is to just wait and watch as conversions and sales increase. Conclusion In conclusion, countdown timers can be a powerful tool for marketing campaigns. By creating a sense of urgency and encouraging customers to take action before time runs out, countdown timers can increase engagement, drive conversions, and ultimately boost the success of your marketing campaigns.  Whether you\u2019re promoting a limited-time sale, a new product launch, or an upcoming event, a countdown timer can help to build anticipation and excitement, and encourage customers to act quickly. However, it\u2019s important to use countdown timers strategically and sparingly, and to ensure that they are relevant to your campaign and your audience. When used effectively, countdown timers can be a valuable addition to your marketing toolkit, helping to drive results and grow your business.
