Team Time\nSQLite DatabaseDatabase A database is an organized collection of data. Access to this data is usually provided by a \"database management system\" (DBMS) consisting of an integrated set of computer software that allows users to interact with one or more databases and provides access to all of the data contained in the database. Because of the close relationship between them, the term \"database\" is often used casually to refer to both a database and the DBMS used to manipulate it. Update\nWP CLICLI A command-line interface (CLI) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text. Today, many users rely upon graphical user interfaces and menu-driven interactions (WordPress WP-Admin). However, some programming and maintenance tasks may not have a graphical user interface and may still use a command line (WP-CLI).
