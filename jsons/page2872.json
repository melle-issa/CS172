It is because of this, Joan decided to give back to the students through her scholarships. Last fall (2018) marked the first year of the Joan Rycraft Bachelor of Social Work and Master of Social Work scholarships, which were awarded to recipients Antonio Carlos Hernandez Rodriguez (BSW) and Soraya Ebrahimi-Nuyken (MSW).\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the support of her father, Joan was fortunate enough to go through her educational career without having to work or rely on student loans. She recognizes that not every student has that luxury and hopes these scholarships will help ease the burden of paying for higher education.In April 2017, Joan returned to Chico to meet with faculty, staff, and students, and guest lectured for a \u201cChild Welfare\u201d class. \u00a0It was a child welfare course taken during her undergraduate program that ignited her passion for working with children and families. She recalls that her interest in child welfare began even earlier as a high school senior learning about child psychology. \u00a0A first-generation college student, she attended CSU, Chico in 1968 and received her bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice and social welfare.\u00a0 She then worked in Redding for Shasta County Children and Family Services. Years later, she pursued her MSW at CSU, Fresno, and then worked as the first MSW in Shasta County Child Protective Services, where she worked her way up from caseworker to administrator. In her 40s, she earned a PhD at the University of Colorado, Denver. She is now professor emerita at the University of Texas at Arlington and was a former associate dean and director of UTA\u2019s PhD Program in Social Work.Her passion for helping children is clear and she had a reputation as the social worker who made all the kids go to school, often walking them into the classroom to ensure they attended. \u201cMost kids, if you support them, will do everything they can to make you proud. This is the motivation, to make them feel like you have their backs,\u201d she said. Joan still receives holiday cards from the now grown children she supported throughout her career.For Joan, her life\u2019s mission is to make sure all children have the chance at a good life, a mission that continues into retirement. Her time is spent providing forensic case analysis on standards of care for consultation firm Park Dietz, based in Newport Beach as their child welfare expert. Joan also serves on the Jackson County Citizen Review Board in Medford, Oregon, where she now lives.\u00a0 Joan\u2019s support of children, education now extends to Chico State social work students as well through her generous scholarships.For more information on how you can help the students and programs at Chico State, please call the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences Development Director, Lise Smith-Peters, at 530-898-3641.Online DonationsMake a one-time or recurring gift online(opens in new window)By Mail or PhoneMail a\u00a0gift form(opens in new window)\u00a0with a single gift or structured pledge, or call 530-898-3641 to submit by phoneStock, Securities &\u00a0Real EstateGive appreciated stock, securities or real estate(opens in new window) and receive a charitable deduction for the full fair market value of the gift, plus\u00a0you may avoid paying capital gains tax on the appreciationGifts for the FutureContact Chico State\u2019s office of\u00a0Planned Giving(opens in new window)\u00a0for help with designing planned contribution strategies that make good sense to you and your financial advisors\u00a0 \u00a0Payroll DeductionSet up an ongoing gift using the payroll deduction form (PDF)\u00a0if you work for Chico State, Associated Students, or the Research FoundationEmployer Matching GiftsTake advantage of your employer\u2019s matching gift program!(opens in new window)Tower SocietyBecome a Tower Society(opens in new window) MemberContact UsTo learn more about giving options and funding priorities please contact the College of Business advancement team.Lise Smith-PetersDevelopment\u00a0Director530-898-3641Generous Donors\n                        George Parrott\n                    \n                        Helping Hands: Valene Smith-Posey\n                    College of Behavioral & Social SciencesButte Hall, Room 701530-898-6171bss@csuchico.eduwww.csuchico.edu/bssSupport Our CollegeProgram PortfolioBSS Majors &\u00a0ProgramsAnthropologyChild DevelopmentEconomicsGeography & PlanningPublic Health & Health Services AdministrationMulticultural & Gender StudiesPolitical Science & Criminal JusticePsychologySocial ScienceSocial WorkSociology\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus.
