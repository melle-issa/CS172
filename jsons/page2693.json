The wide obi\n emerged from the richest patterns, was cinched\n around the tiny waist and fastened\n at the back. Black crepe became hair\n coiled in the style of old Edo, adorned\n with a splash of crimson. Here my mind\u2019s eye\n falters, struggles to complete the image\u2014\nand then I remember: the dolls were faceless,\n a blank oval of white tissue where eyes, mouth,\n and nose should have been\u2014sightless, speechless,\n floating gracefully on their slender frames,\n hothouse orchids, mute and ephemeral.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When I first met Mari L\u2019Esperance on October 7th, 2010, I had recently finished reading her full-length collection of poems, The Darkened Temple. \u00a0Mari was invited to read her collection at California State University, Chico, and I was honored to have been given the opportunity to introduce her remarkable work to a diverse audience of listeners.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Chico heat was slowly laying itself to sleep, as autumn stirred the rustling leaves, and the sycamore trees left the University streets lined with crackling fragments. I remember what Mari said as we made our way to the reading, my palms moist with anxiety\u2013a fear of speaking before others that I still can\u2019t seem to overcome\u2013but in her words, soft and contemplative, she said, \u201cI love the dying season best.\u201d We walked along the University grounds, in near darkness, crumbled leaves underfoot, and I suddenly realized that in those few words, Mari had inadvertently framed the complexities of The Darkened Temple for me, a collection with strong ties to memory, loss, and rebirth. Much like the transformation of the seasons, time and again, the eternal rest of a fallen leaf, this collection spoke to the transformation of the soul, the embrace of grief and its suffering, and the realization of one\u2019s personal legend along the way.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It is wondrous how successful poetry can make the reader feel so suddenly, intimately involved with the poet, as if the words have intentionally inspired a correspondence. After reading Mari\u2019s poems, even yet, I experience so many different emotions: with poems like \u201cThe Dollmaker\u201d, I carry the speaker\u2019s suffering for loss and the nostalgia for her heritage, and I mourn with the speaker in the poem, \u201cTrying to Carry It\u201d. \u00a0I find that all of Mari L\u2019Esperance\u2019s poems are graceful, compelling, and evocative. Please join me for a conversation with Mari L\u2019Esperance:\nSabrina: Can you describe your drafting and revision process for The Darkened Temple?\nMari L\u2019Esperance: First, thank you, Sabrina, for inviting me to participate in this interview and for your kind words about my poems. I also enjoyed meeting you in Chico two years ago and fondly remember visiting your class, taught by the lovely Jeanne E. Clark.\nAs to your question: it\u2019s a tough one to answer, mostly because several of the poems in TDT were written quite a few years ago, so my memory\u2019s fuzzy. What I can say: I was writing poem by poem and did not have a manuscript in mind as I was writing; that came many years later, once I realized I\u2019d amassed enough publishable poems that might cohere into some kind of integrated whole. In terms of revision, I often tweak and fiddle with poems for months, sometimes years after they\u2019ve been drafted and really only lay them to rest once they\u2019ve been accepted for publication (and sometimes even that\u2019s not the end of it!). It\u2019s my obsessive nature, I suppose\u2014not uncommon with poets!\nSabrina: You consider yourself a Hapa poet, so your identity is very much connected to your Japanese heritage. How has that influenced your writing?\nMari L\u2019Esperance: I\u2019d say my Japanese heritage significantly influences my writing and creative process, but in ways that are mostly not conscious to me. Japanese culture has traditionally been an inward-focused culture, where the interior life is deeply felt and resonant. This stance is reflected in Japan\u2019s traditional arts and worldview, although there\u2019s begun to be a shift in recent years, most noticeably post-3/11. I know that poems for me almost always begin with a feeling and an image (remembered or imagined), or an image that invites a particular feeling response. The beginning of a poem is a deeply interior experience for me and needs to evolve just like that\u2014internally\u2014and sometimes over many months before I\u2019m ready to commit anything to paper. Therefore, I am not a particularly \u201cproductive\u201d poet in the sense that I don\u2019t write daily, or even weekly. This inwardness, the internal gestation and shape shifting of emotional and psychological material over long periods of time, could be attributed to my Japanese self, but I also know of Western (and non-Japanese/Hapa) poets who work in a similar fashion. Temperament has a lot to do with one\u2019s creative process\u2014as much as cultural influence, I think.\nSabrina Derr: I understand that much of the inspiration for The Darkened Temple was a coming to terms with the disappearance of your mother. How do you think that has ultimately shaped this collection?\nMari L\u2019Esperance: Yes, the central concern of TDT is the disappearance of my mother in 1995 when I was studying poetry as a graduate student at New York University. Understandably, her disappearance has become a core theme for me and will likely infuse my writing for the rest of my life, in one form or another. There are a few poems in the collection that predate my mother\u2019s disappearance, but in gathering poems for the manuscript back in 2006, it quickly became apparent to me that loss and the integration of loss were central themes in most of the poems. Since the book was published in 2008, I\u2019ve come to realize the collection as a whole also speaks, indirectly and symbolically, to the devaluation of the archetypal feminine in our troubled world, evidenced by the havoc being wreaked on the environment, not to mention human rights violations in many countries and the systematic dismantling of social services, education, and healthcare as we\u2019ve known them here at home. So although the collection is largely \u201cabout\u201d my mother\u2019s disappearance and its aftermath, I do believe it speaks to loss (and transformation) on a more universal scale as well.\nSabrina: I recall you telling me once that when you initially saw the cover of the book, you cringed. Did you have much of a say in the selection process, and looking back on it now that it has been well-received, what do you think of it?\nMari L\u2019Esperance: You have a good memory! Yes, when I first saw the cover, I\u2019ll admit I was taken aback\u2014the colors and design were so bold and graphic and did not at all seem aligned with the content of my manuscript, which I felt was quiet and understated and needed a cover design that reflected this understatedness (that\u2019s my Japanese self speaking!). But over time the cover has grown on me and I\u2019ve come to appreciate its dark beauty and intensity. It really does reflect the transformational aspect of the manuscript accurately\u2014 \u201cBelow the furnace, the ash,\u201d to quote Brenda Hillman\u2014so there was clearly wisdom involved in its selection. The design team at the University of Nebraska Press did not involve me much in the selection process, but were open to my input.\nSabrina: What is your process for submitting new writing?\nMari L\u2019Esperance: I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ve not been sending out work for a while now; I\u2019m not at that stage. But when I\u2019m in submission mode, I\u2019ll send poems to editors who\u2019ve generously invited me to submit or to journals I admire and think will be receptive to my work. I know I\u2019m not alone, but I really do despise sending my work out\u2014there, I said it!\u2014but realize it\u2019s a necessary stage in the life of a poem if one wants it to be read. That said, I\u2019m resigned to being in non-submission mode a while longer. I\u2019m preparing to move to Los Angeles at the end of November and it\u2019ll be some time before the dust settles. I\u2019m curious to see how a change in surroundings, geography, and climate will influence new work.\nSabrina: What advice would you give to new writers beginning the practice of submitting their work?\nMari L\u2019Esperance: As someone who\u2019s spent time on both sides of the transom (until recently, I served as an Associate Poetry Editor for Connotation Press: An Online Artifact), I humbly offer:\n\u2013 Don\u2019t rush to publish. Make sure your work is ready, and then send out only your best work.\n\u2013 Submit to publications whose aesthetics are aligned with your own (which means subscribing to/reading a wide array of journals, as your budget allows).\n\u2013 Follow the submission guidelines! This means: if the guidelines specify \u201cSubmit 3-5 poems,\u201d don\u2019t submit 10. If the submission period is September through May, don\u2019t submit in July. This process is hard enough without making it harder on yourself by not following the guidelines.\n\u2013 Be courteous and brief in your cover letter (if submitting by snail mail\u2014a disappearing practice, it seems) and address the editor(s) by name whenever possible.\n\u2013 Do say something brief about why you\u2019re submitting to Journal X and do mention a small handful of recent publications in your cover letter.\n\u2013 Don\u2019t include a five-page bio; no one will read it and (I think) it\u2019s a turnoff. Your poems should be front and center.\n\u2013 If your work is accepted for publication, send a brief note of acknowledgment and gratitude; editors like to know their often-invisible toil is appreciated. Also: publishing is all about relationships, and editors have long memories; I say this only partly in jest.\n\u2013 Have faith: if the work\u2019s good, it will find a home. Rejection is part and parcel of the writing life. Have your feelings of discouragement and disappointment (I have them often!), but then turn around and resubmit. This is another reason to submit seasoned work rather than work that\u2019s fresh out of the gate; we\u2019re often more emotionally attached to newer work and rejection can sting that much more. Build up that rejection callous!\n\u2013 Believe in your work. If you don\u2019t, no one else will.\nSabrina: Which of the poems in your collection was the most difficult to write?\nMari L\u2019Esperance: I suppose they were all difficult to write, each in its own way. But if I have to choose one, I\u2019d say the 10-section \u201cWhite Hydrangeas as a Way Back to the Self\u201d because I really had to descend to a deep place within myself to access the poem, while at the same time struggle mightily to convey authenticity of feeling and experience; avoid gratuitous sentimentality; and incorporate form and shape and appropriate language/diction, images, and sonic effects that allowed the poem to succeed on the page. I also feared being \u201ctoo self disclosing,\u201d but ultimately let the poem speak the way it needed to speak.\nSabrina: Do you have a special writing ritual?\nMari L\u2019Esperance: It\u2019s not \u201cspecial,\u201d but I do need adequate (thirty minutes to an hour) time and space to daydream and stare into nothingness before writing. Reading, intuitively and without external directives, often has a part in this wool gathering phase. I\u2019d call this process \u201ccreating transitional space,\u201d which is necessary (at least for me) to access the deeper layers of my psyche, where the beginnings of poems reside. I do carry a small notebook in which I\u2019ll occasionally jot things down, but I don\u2019t necessarily translate my jottings into poems; it all simply goes into the pot and somehow results in Art\u2014somehow, sometime.\nSabrina: This is kind of a strange question, but what is your favorite animated film?\nMari L\u2019Esperance: Oh\u2026 so hard to name just one! But I absolutely love Isao Takahata\u2019s \u201cGrave of the Fireflies\u201d (1988) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095327/ because it powerfully connects me with my mother\u2019s experience as a young girl in Japan during World War II. Although it\u2019s not easy to watch, I highly recommend it. Following closely are Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d (1988) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096283/ and Yoshifumi Kondo\u2019s \u201cWhisper of the Heart\u201d (1995) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113824/; the former is now well known in the United States, the second less so. \u201cWhisper of the Heart\u201d has a special place in my heart because it\u2019s set in pre-Internet/cell phone Japan and brings me back to pleasant memories of my childhood there (although I was mostly raised in the United States, I visited Japan often when I was growing up). I also now realize the film was released the year my mother disappeared; I hadn\u2019t noticed this before, but this might help to explain its significance to me.\n\u2014\u2014-\nSabrina: It\u2019s been an honor, Mari. Thank you.\nMari L\u2019Esperance: Thank you kindly, Sabrina, for this opportunity. It\u2019s been a pleasure.\nTo find out more about Mari L\u2019Esperance, her books, and upcoming readings, visit her website at: http://www.marilesperance.com/\n\n \n\nAugust 20, 2013watershedcsuc CSUC, interview, Mari L'Esperance, poetry, Sabrina Derr, The Darkened Temple, Watershed Review\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll\n\nDiscuss\nGet Inspired\nGet Polling\nGet Support\nLearn WordPress.com\nTheme Showcase\nWordPress Planet\nWordPress.com News\n\n\nTopics\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nUpcoming Events No upcoming events\nArchives\n\nMay 2022\nMarch 2022\nMay 2020\nOctober 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nOctober 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nApril 2017\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nDecember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nApril 2014\nFebruary 2014\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nAugust 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\n\n \n\nFollow me on TwitterMy Tweets \n\n\n\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
