Students should direct specific questions to their graduate advisor or visit the Graduate Studies website for more information. \u00a0\u00a0\nApplication Procedures\nApplicants for post-baccalaureate, certificate, credential, master\u2019s\u00a0or doctoral programs must submit an application by the program deadline on calstate.edu/apply. Each application requires a $70 nonrefundable application fee. Programs may require additional materials for admission. In some cases, application or testing requirements may be different from what is listed in the catalog. Please visit the program website to find the current admissions requirements and contact the graduate adviser for more information.\nApplication Deadlines\nThe application period for admission opens on October 1 for fall admission and August 1 for spring admission. Deadlines vary for individual programs based upon program cycles and capacities. Check the website of the specific program of interest for current deadline information.\nTranscripts\nOfficial transcripts from all colleges or universities previously attended must be submitted to CSUF. Transcripts that include transfer credit from a different institution is not sufficient evidence of coursework taken elsewhere. Transcripts should be sent directly to the university Admissions Office in a sealed envelope or electronically (preferable) by the college or university. Current CSUF students or alumni do not need to request official transcripts from CSUF. Once the university\u00a0receives a student\u2019s documents, they become official records of CSUF and cannot be returned or reissued. International transcripts must be accompanied by certified English translations.\u00a0\nTests\nSome programs may require a standardized test, like the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). Test requirements vary by program, please check the program requirements to determine if test scores are needed.\nEnglish Language Requirement\nAll graduate and post-baccalaureate applicants, regardless of citizenship, whose native language is not English and whose preparatory education was principally in a language other than English, must submit proof of English proficiency. Information about English proficiency requirements can be found on the  International Admissions website. The requirements may vary depending on the student\u2019s program of interest.\nInternational Students\nSee procedures outlined in the international student portion of the Admissions\u00a0\u00a0section of this catalog.\nSecond Master\u2019s Degree or Concentration\nApplication for admission to graduate standing in a second degree program or concentration will be accepted only after the first degree has been awarded. Students can only complete one master\u2019s degree at a time. Units used for the first degree or concentration may not be applied to the second. Students who have completed a master\u2019s degree at CSUF in one concentration and wish to complete another concentration within the same degree program will not be awarded a second degree; instead, only a transcript notation will be added listing the completion of the second concentration. As such, second concentration students do not have to pay the graduation and diploma fee a second time.\nAdmission Procedures\nFollowing completion of application procedures and subsequent review of the student\u2019s eligibility by the Admissions Office and appropriate academic unit, the student will be notified by the Admissions Office with an official admission decision. Written email notice from the Admissions Office is the only valid proof of admission. Academic advising prior to admission is tentative and should not be construed as granting official admission to a program or establishing requirements for the degree.\nAdmission to the Master\u2019s Degree Programs\nThe minimum requirements for admission to graduate and post-baccalaureate studies at a CSU campus are in accordance with university regulations as well as Title 5, Chapter 1, Subchapter 3 of the California Code of Regulations.\u00a0\nMaster\u2019s students should: 1) have completed a four-year college course of study and hold an acceptable baccalaureate degree from an institution accredited by a regional accrediting association, or shall have completed equivalent academic preparation as determined by appropriate campus authorities; 2) be in good academic standing at the last college or university attended; 3) have earned a grade-point average of at least 2.5 on the last degree completed by the candidate or have attained a grade-point average of at least 2.5 (A=4.0) in the last 60 semester (90 quarter) units attempted; and 4) satisfactorily meet the professional, personal, scholastic and other standards for graduate study, including\u00a0qualifying examinations, as appropriate to the program of study.\nAdmission to the Ed.D. Program\nMinimum requirements for admission to the Ed.D. program are: 1) an earned baccalaureate degree and master\u2019s degree from an accredited institution or institutions of higher education; 2) good academic standing at the last institution of higher education attended; 3) a grade-point average minimum of 3.0 in upper-division and graduate study; 4) demonstrated sufficient preparation for, experience in and potential for educational leadership, including: successful experience in leadership in school, post-secondary or community contexts, or policy leadership; academic excellence; problem-solving ability; technological proficiency; interest in critically assessing current educational policies and practices; and interest in improving current educational policies and practices. Admission shall be granted on a competitive basis.\nAdmission to the DNP\u00a0Program\nThe minimum requirements for admission to the DNP program are: 1) an earned baccalaureate degree and master\u2019s degree from an accredited institution or institutions, the latter either in (a) nursing or a health-related field (i.e., public health or health administration) and national certification as an APRN (CNM, CNS, CRNA or NP) for preparation as clinicians, leaders or educators (direct care track), or in (b) nursing leadership or administration, nursing education or community health nursing for preparation as nurse educators or nurse leaders (indirect care track); 2) a grade-point average minimum of 3.5 (on a 4.0 scale) in all graduate coursework; 3) in good standing at the last institution of higher education attended; 4) current, unrestricted California RN licensure or eligibility and advanced practice national certification and national furnishing/prescriptive authority, if applicable. For additional admissions requirements, see CSUF\u2019s School of Nursing website.\nAdmission Classification Categories\nStudents who meet the minimum requirements for graduate and post-baccalaureate studies may be considered for admission in one of the four following categories below:\nGraduate Classified - To pursue a graduate degree, applicants are required to fulfill all of the professional, personal, scholastic, and other standards, including qualifying examinations, prescribed by the campus. A student\u2019s status is changed to classified standing when an official Study Plan has been approved by the associate vice president for academic programs (or designee). It is the student\u2019s responsibility to initiate the request for classified standing by making an appointment with the departmental graduate adviser to develop a Study Plan.\nClassified standing is granted when: 1) all prerequisites have been satisfactorily completed; 2) the official Study Plan has been developed and signed by the graduate program adviser; and 3) the Study Plan is sent to the Office of Graduate Studies and approved by the associate vice president for academic programs (or designee).\nGraduate Conditionally Classified - Applicants may be admitted to a graduate degree program in this category if, in the opinion of appropriate campus authority, the applicant needs addition coursework or academic prepration.\nThis category applies to students with a graduate degree objective. To qualify for admission in conditionally classified standing, applicants must: 1) meet the general admission requirements; and 2) meet any additional requirements of the particular program, including a favorable recommendation from the academic unit.\nAn applicant who needs additional coursework or academic preparation may be considered for admission in conditionally classified standing with the approval and recommendation of the academic unit. A student admitted in conditionally classified standing may subsequently be granted classified standing in a graduate degree program if professional, personal, scholastic or other standards, including qualifying examinations are met.\nDetermination of additional coursework and adadmic preparation is made by the academic unit. For specific information on prerequisites to classified standing, refer to the graduate degree requirements described in the appropriate academic departmental section of this catalog.\u00a0\nPost-Baccalaureate Classified\u00a0 - Credential or certificate program students will be required to satisfy additional professional, personal, scholastic\u00a0and other standards, including qualifying examinations, prescribed by the campus.\nTo qualify for admission, applicants must: 1) meet the general admissions requirements; and 2) satisfy any additional professional, personal, scholastic\u00a0and other standards, including qualifying examinations. Refer to specific credential requirements under the Teaching Credentials\u00a0\u00a0section or individual departmental websites.\nPost-Baccalaureate Unclassified - To enroll in undergraduate courses as preparation for advanced degree programs or to enroll in graduate courses for professional or personal growth, applicants must be admitted as post-baccalaureate unclassified students. By meeting the general requirements, applicants are eligible for admission as post-baccalaureate unclassified students. Admission in this status does not constitute admission to, or assurance of consideration for admission to, any graduate degree or credential program.\u00a0\nNote: These and other CSU admission requirements are subject to change as policies are revised and laws are amended. The CSU website calstate.edu and the CSU admission portal calstate.edu/apply are good sources for the most up-to-date information.\n\n\n\n\u00a0Back to Top | Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window)\n\n\nFacebook this Page (opens a new window)\n\n\n\n\nTweet this Page (opens a new window)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAll catalogs \u00a9 2023 California State University Fullerton.
