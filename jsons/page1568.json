But the rise of gun violence in the U.S., especially violence perpetrated against immigrants and people of color, left him wondering if trying to cross the border was the right choice. \u201cIs it worth it?\u201d he asked her.\nRios-Contreras, an assistant professor of sociology at Chapman University\u2019s Wilkinson College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences, has been studying the dynamics of the migrant community in Tijuana since 2018, when migrant caravans at the U.S.-Mexico border started to dominate U.S news and political discourse.\n\u201cTijuana is a beautiful city,\u201d Rios-Contreras says. \u201cThere are migrant communities from all over the world there \u2013 people who have tried to reach the United States. Unfortunately, they\u2019re not able to complete the journey because of U.S. policies. So now they\u2019re in Tijuana, building community. You have people who have opened businesses. You have people who have been forced to acquire skills and to learn Spanish. So I think it\u2019s a very beautiful community as well.\u201d\nBut that beauty is often masked by the city\u2019s reputation as the most dangerous city in the world, based on homicide statistics. Rios-Contreras\u2019 goal is to get past the community\u2019s alarming statistics and reveal the complex human stories underneath.\nHer research, supported by a grant from Chapman\u2019s Scholarly Creative Fund, has allowed her to distribute cameras to individuals within the community, giving migrants the opportunity to document their own stories without the intrusive lens of an outside researcher. By collaborating directly with migrants and asylum seekers, Rios-Contreras has started to build a holistic and more accurate portrait of their lives and of the complex, diverse community that has emerged at the Tijuana border.\u00a0\nUnderstanding a Complex Community\nRecently, migrants in Tijuana from Central and South America and Haiti have been joined by refugees from the war in Ukraine, as they all wait to gain entry to the U.S.\n\u201cWhen I started my research, it was mostly migrants from Central America who were coming \u2013\u00a0 from Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala \u2013 to Tijuana in order to reach the United States,\u201d she says.\nOver time, though, the migrant population in Tijuana has shifted. Along with the Central American migrants, there are an increasing number of Haitian migrants, stemming from the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, and most recently, refugees from the war in Ukraine. In addition to people who are trying to come into the U.S. for the first time, there are those who have already been in the U.S. and were deported back to Mexico, as well as asylum seekers who, under the U.S government\u2019s Migrant Protection Protocols, are being returned to wait in Mexico on the outcome of their appeals.\nForced to wait on the bureaucracy of the U.S. immigration system to gain legal entrance into the country, most migrants reside in shelters and tent cities, operated by religious groups or by the government, often with limited facilities and without access to adequate health care and education. Most cannot afford legal representation to guide them through the system, and even if they find pro bono representation, the rate of approval for asylum is very low.\u00a0\nThe Violence of Waiting\u00a0\nRios-Contreras, a criminologist by training, understands how trauma manifests in the migrant experience. People who have faced physical, emotional and psychological violence in their home countries \u2013 extortion, kidnapping, violent crime \u2013 must endure another kind of violence once they reach the border and are forced to wait.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult experience, especially for women who bring children and for people of different sexualities,\u201d says Rios-Contreras, noting that Mexico perpetuates many patriarchal values. Men might try to find work, but without documentation they can only work illegally. Children are unable to attend school. Migrants often also face violence from Mexican authorities.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that some people attempt the border crossing without authorization. The trip carries risks, whether migrants cross through the desert or by swimming north through the Pacific Ocean.\u00a0\nDuring one of Rios-Contreras\u2019 most recent trips to the border, a migrant crossed at the site where she was working.\n\u201cThe whole community sort of stopped,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a pause in the air, just observing a migrant crossing the wall through undocumented means. And then the Border Patrol came and detained the person as they were trying to claim asylum.\u201d\nMore than once, Rios-Contreras has had participants tell her that their first encounter with the United States was with a border enforcement officer pointing a gun at them.\n\u201cGun violence is one of the reasons why they left their country in the first place. They\u2019ve traveled thousands of miles, whether walking, through car rides, through bus rides, through flights to get to Tijuana, where they finally crossed the border into the United States. The first welcome that they get is an official pointing a gun at them,\u201d she says.\u00a0\n\u201cI had a mother who told me that she was scared for her children. She really thought the border enforcement officer was going to shoot her children and her. Then the question becomes, was this migration worth it?\u201d says Rios-Contreras.\u00a0\nImposing barriers of concrete and steel presents a formidable barrier to migrants. (Photo by Socrates Mbamalu.)\nTeaching About Violence, Understanding Humanity\nChapman is just over 100 miles from Tijuana, which makes it an ideal location for the study of the migrant communities there \u2014 not just for faculty members like Rios-Contreras but for students as well.\n\u201cPart of my research also has to do with understanding violence and teaching my students at Chapman University how we do that in an ethical way,\u201d says Rios-Contreras. \u201cHow do we go and study people in their most unfortunate place in life? How can we understand their experience with a little bit of humanity as a researcher?\u201d\nIn spring 2022, a speaker series brought migrant-rights defenders to campus virtually, and students from Rios-Contreras\u2019 \u201cRefugees and Migration\u201d course participated in a field trip to the border crossing station in San Ysidro, where they witnessed first hand the physical barriers that stand between would-be immigrants and the U.S.\n\u201cIt was important for me to see \u2026 this border that has been talked about for so long, what it represents and looks like,\u201d says Socrates Mbamalu (MA \u201923), a graduate student in the Chapman War, Diplomacy, and Society program. Mbamalu was surprised by the immensity of the physical barriers separating the U.S. from Mexico. An immigrant from Nigeria, he has often traveled across borders in West Africa, but he has never seen anything comparable, he says.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just get into the U.S. You have to show a valid reason for your existence,\u201d he says.\n\u201cAs an immigrant, I don\u2019t like being at the border,\u201d says Montserrat Bugueno (MA \u201922), who is originally from Chile. Bugueno has made the border crossing at Tijuana multiple times with her family to renew visas.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very nerve wracking. I don\u2019t like it. I know that I have everything to be here legally. It\u2019s just the fact that when you\u2019re there, when you are not American, they make you feel that you\u2019re not American,\u201d she says.\nRios-Contreras hopes that the course and class trip are just the first steps toward helping Chapman students take advantage of the university\u2019s proximity to the border.\n\u201cI think in terms of internships, volunteer opportunities, or just class field trips I really want to develop this relationship, and just symbolically build a bridge between Tijuana and Chapman University,\u201d she says.\nLearn more about Sociology and Wilkinson College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences.\u00a0\n\n\nDepartment of Sociology features research Sociology \n\n\n\n\n \n\nStaci Dumoski \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHispanic Heritage Month Events at Chapman University\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Continues Its Steady Climb in U.S. News & World Report Rankings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Asia-Pacific Initiative Offers Unique Take on Hotbed Region Growing up in Los Angeles, Robert Koepp became fascinated with Asia.
