No plugins needed!\nManaged security:\u00a0We proactively scan and block malware and hacking attempts. We do all of this at the server level, without the need for any plugins or configuration on the part of the customer. And in the unlikely event that your site is hacked, we\u2019ll fix it for you, free of charge.\nManaged software updates:\u00a0We\u2019ll work with you to make sure your site is always running the latest and greatest WordPress software.\nExpert WordPress support:\u00a0Our team of WordPress experts goes above and beyond what nearly any other managed hosting company will help out with. From \u201chey, I need help, I have a serious problem!\u201c, to \u201ccan you recommend a plugin for XYZ,\u201d we\u2019re here to help.\nThose are the core pieces of what it means to be a true managed WordPress hosting provider. If you have any questions, let us know!\n\n\n\nHow is Flywheel different from other managed WordPress hosting companies? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a number of things that make Flywheel stand out from other companies in the WordPress hosting industry. Here\u2019s a nice, long list:\nWe ONLY host WordPress sites.\u00a0We specialize in WordPress and it\u2019s all we do, day in and day out. Our servers are tuned for WordPress, our support team is staffed with WordPress experts, and our resources are all WordPress-oriented.\nFree migrations, free SSL, free demo sites, free malware cleanup.\u00a0Your Flywheel plan comes with a bunch of brilliant perks for the low, low price of zero cents.\nOur plans start at just $13.\u00a0Most managed WordPress hosts start at much more than that!\nWe have a TON of workflow tools for agencies, designers, and developers.\u00a0Flywheel is so much more than a hosting company. From billing transfer to collaboration tools, we have a suite of fantastic features that are designed to make your clients happier and your life easier.\nDedicated resources.\u00a0You aren\u2019t sharing your server space with anyone else, leading to better performance and security.\n99.9% uptime.\u00a0It really, truly can\u2019t get much better than that!\nSupport.\u00a0Our team is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week via live chat. They\u2019re all experts in the industry, so they can help with everything from an odd error to a recommendation for a plugin.\nA custom control panel.\u00a0Instead of relying on clunky cPanel, we built our own beautiful, intuitive dashboard.\nNeed more?\u00a0Check out our reviews section for a few extra reasons why agencies and creatives have chosen to host with us!\n\n\n\nWill Flywheel help me move my WordPress site(s)? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutely!\nWe know how painful it can be to move a WordPress site from one server to another, and that\u2019s why we help our customers move their sites \u2013 FOR FREE. Whether you\u2019re moving 1 or 100 sites, our migration team will move your site(s) as quickly and efficiently as possible.\nCheck out our migrations page for more details or simply fill out our secure\u00a0migration request form\u00a0with some details about your previous hosting account, and we\u2019ll get your site transferred and set up as a demo site under your account. You can then review it to see how everything performs, and make sure everything is in place!\n\n\n\nWill my site be faster on Flywheel? \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, most likely! We\u2019ve spent years architecting the Flywheel Cloud Platform to be the speediest option available for WordPress sites. In fact, we\u2019re more than happy to move a copy of your site to Flywheel so you can compare it with your current host!
