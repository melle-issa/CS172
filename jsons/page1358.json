Pressable snuck into second fastest average between those two.          \nWPPerformanceTester Testing Results\nWPPerformanceTester performs two benchmarks. One is a WordPress (WP Bench) and the other is a PHP Bench. WP Bench measures how many WP queries per second and higher tends to be better (varies considerably by architecture). PHP Bench performs a lot of computational and some database operations which are measured in seconds to complete. Lower PHP Bench is better.\n \nResults Table\nCompanyPHP BenchWP BenchCloudways 7.474977.5171065GreenGeeks 12.0161351.351351Krystal Hosting 10.118446.6279589MDDHosting 8.331248.439451Pressable 10.0391351.351351Presslabs 11.378560.8524958raidboxes 11.841667.5567423SiteGround 9.3971477.104874WordPress.com 9.6562392.344498WPX 6.9832583.979328 Discussion\n\n\n          WPX had the fastest PHP and WP Bench scores. \n\n\nCloudways had the second fastest PHP Bench.\n\n\nWordPress.com had the second fastest WP Bench.           \nSSL Testing Results\nThe tool is available at https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/\nResults Table\nCompanyQualsys SSL GradeCloudways AGreenGeeks A+Krystal Hosting AMDDHosting APressable APresslabs A+raidboxes A+SiteGround AWordPress.com A+WPX A Discussion\n\n\n          GreenGeeks, Presslabs, Raidboxes and WordPress.com all earned A+.\n\n\nEveryone else earned an A.          \n\nConclusion\nThere are two levels of recognition awarded to companies that participate in the tests. There is no \u2018best\u2019 declared, it\u2019s simply tiered, it\u2019s hard to come up with an objective ranking system because of the complex nature of hosting. These tests also don\u2019t take into account outside factors such as reviews, support, and features. It is simply testing performance as described in the methodology.\nTop Tier\nThis year's Top Tier WordPress Hosting Performance Award goes to the following companies who showed virtually no signs of struggle during the testing.\n Cloudways     GreenGeeks     Krystal Hosting     MDDHosting     Pressable     Presslabs     SiteGround     WordPress.com     WPX     \nHonorable Mention\nThe following companies earned Honorable Mention status because they did very well and had a minor issue or two holding them back from earning Top Tier status.\nNo company achieved this status. \nIndividual Host Analysis\n Cloudways    Cloudways had perfect uptime on one monitor while Hetrix Tools showed a much lower number across every plan for some reason. Cloudways had the second fastest PHP Bench. Cloudways also handled the Load Storm and Static tests without issue. Given the overall good performance, the only possible detraction is the uptime monitors which showed very different numbers, my third monitoring system broke so I don't have a tie breaker, I will err on the side of good faith. Cloudways put together a Top Tier performance that handled all the tests well.Visit Cloudways  Website GreenGeeks    GreenGeeks had the fastest wp-login speed on the Load Storm test. GreenGeeks had excellent uptime. They also handled the Static test without issue.
