It\u2019s called Editable Dance GEneration (EDGE).\n\u201cEDGE shows that AI-enabled characters can bring a level of musicality and artistry to dance animation that was not possible before,\u201d says Karen Liu, a professor of computer science who led a team that included two student collaborators, Jonathan Tseng and Rodrigo Castellon, in her lab.\nThe researchers believe that the tool will help choreographers design sequences and communicate their ideas to live dancers by visualizing 3D dance sequences. Key to the program\u2019s advanced capabilities is editability. Liu imagines that EDGE could be used to create computer-animated dance sequences by allowing animators to intuitively edit any parts of dance motion.\nFor example, the animator can design specific leg movements of the character, and EDGE will \u201cauto-complete\u201d the entire body from that positioning in a way that is realistic, seamless, and physically plausible as well \u2014 a human could complete the moves. Above all, the moves are consistent with the animator\u2019s choice of music.\nLike other generative models for images and text \u2014 ChatGPT and DALL-E, for instance \u2014 EDGE represents a new tool for choreographic idea generation and movement planning.\u00a0The editability means that dance artists and choreographers can iteratively refine their sequences move by move, position by position, adding specific poses at precise moments. EDGE then incorporates the additional details into the sequence automatically. In the near future, EDGE will allow users to input their own music and even demonstrate the moves themselves in front of a camera.\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a really a fun and engaging way for everyone, not just dancers, to express themselves through movement and tap into their own creativity,\u201d Liu says.\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cWith its ability to generate captivating dances in response to any music, we think EDGE represents a major milestone in the intersection of technology and movement,\u201d adds Tseng. \u201cIt will unlock new possibilities for creative expression and physical engagement,\u201d says Castellon.\nThe team has published a paper and will formally introduce EDGE at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference in Vancouver, British Columbia, in June. There is also a website called \u201cEDGE Playground\u201d where anyone who is interested can pick the tune and watch as EDGE creates a new dance sequence from scratch.\n\u201cEveryone is invited to play with it. It\u2019s fun!\u201d Liu says.\nStanford HAI\u2019s mission is to advance AI research, education, policy and practice to improve the human condition.\u00a0Learn more.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore News Topics\n\nDesign and Human-Computer Interaction, Machine Learning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate\n\n\nWelcome\n\n\nValues\n\n\nNews\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nCareers\n\n\n\n\nParticipate\n\n\nGet Involved\n\n\nGrant Programs\n\n\nCorporate Programs\n\n\nLearn more about giving to HAI\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StanfordHAI\nhttps://www.facebook.com/StanfordHAI\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChugFTK0KyrES9terTid8vA\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/stanfordhai\nhttps://www.instagram.com/stanfordhai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up\nDon\u2019t miss out.
