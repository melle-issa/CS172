The study of economics serves a number of purposes: it helps students understand the functioning of markets, of firms and of financial organizations; it helps students understand public debate about economic policy, including taxation and government expenditure, trade and globalization, the development and growth of the economy, health and welfare; it prepares students for graduate study in business and law as well as graduate work in economics or public policy, leading to careers in teaching and research in economics; and it serves as a direct stepping stone towards employment in business, non-profits, finance, and government organizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Academics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduate\n\n\n\n\n\n  The Ph.D. program in Economics at Brown trains students in economic theory and the tools of economic analysis. Through coursework, participation in seminars, and supervised research students are taught to conduct theoretical and empirical research at the highest level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate\n\n\n\n\n\n  Economics is one of the most popular concentrations at Brown.
