What do a Senate hearing on cybersecurity, an iconic Orange County citrus packing house, an exciting new nationwide survey and a high-profile appointment to a higher-education legal organization have in common?\nAnswer: They\u2019re recent, notable examples of Chapman University\u2019s national impact in the sphere of higher education administration \u2013 the running of a university and campus. And whether you measure the university\u2019s national reach with data, media buzz or below-the-radar collaborations, the work of four women administrators and their teams at Chapman is shining a national spotlight on the university in surprisingly diverse and powerful ways.\nHere\u2019s how these leaders are making a difference \u2013 and why they say it matters for Chapman and beyond.\n\u00a0A Voice for Opportunity in Cybersecurity\nIn May 2022, Chapman\u2019s chief information officer Helen Norris testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions as an expert witness on cybersecurity in higher ed. \u201cThe complexity of the work is enormous,\u201d Norris told the senators and others at the hearing. \u201cWe are constantly dealing with new threats. We have ever-growing lakes of data with privacy implications that must be protected.\u201d\n\nAs CIO at Chapman, Norris is responsible not just for the university\u2019s ever-changing, multi-layered cybersecurity defense system but for all information technology.\n\u201cA lot of my work is ensuring faculty and students have what they need to become superstars in their fields,\u201d she says. \u201cAs the university has grown as a research institution, we\u2019ve done a lot of work to provide resources such as high-performance computing and setting up easy and secure ways for faculty and students to store and share their work.\u201d\u00a0\nNorris led the stepped-up use of the learning management system Canvas during COVID and created a fund faculty and staff can use for pilot projects to test-drive additional Canvas features, including a tool called Name Coach that provides a pronunciation guide for users\u2019 names.\nInclusivity is part of her mission.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great tool that helps people feel included a little bit more,\u201d she notes.\nSince the Fowler School of Engineering received a gift of a powerful supercomputer from the innovative tech giant NVIDIA, Norris\u2019 department is managing it in partnership with the school, NVIDIA and the community groups Trace3 and CEO Leadership Alliance of Orange County to support the talent and training of students throughout Orange County. A story with more details about the supercomputer is on Page 40.\nNorris and her team give back at a national level, too. She holds leadership positions on several cybersecurity and information technology boards, including a seat on the Dell Higher Education Advisory Board. She\u2019s also chair of EDUCAUSE, the nation\u2019s largest community of campus leaders advancing higher education through the use of information technology.\n\u201cI have a strong network in the higher education IT community, and our department has a great reputation with vendors and colleagues across the country,\u201d she says. \u201cWe share best practices in cybersecurity through EDUCAUSE, and sometimes we get to set the agenda with our partners. Colleges and universities need to collaborate for strong cybersecurity.\u201d\nAbout Helen Norris\nPreviously: \u201cI worked in computer programming for the U.S. Army in Frankfurt, Germany, after graduating from Trinity College in Ireland,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to take advantage of all sorts of work opportunities, including upward and lateral moves. That\u2019s where you learn so\u00a0much.\u201d\nIt\u2019s important to \u2026 \u201cEncourage young women to pursue careers in STEM fields,\u201d says Norris, who serves on the boards of advisors for the Southern California Society for Information Management and the EmpowHer Institute.\n\u00a0Sharing Chapman\u2019s Story on the Biggest Stage\u00a0\nOn a Friday morning in mid-July, Jamie Ceman, vice president of Strategic Marketing and Communications at Chapman, got very good news.\n\u201cWe are always focused on bringing the Chapman story to life, telling people how special and unique this university is,\u201d she says. \u201cToday we received new research indicating that we\u2019re moving the needle. The percentage of people across the U.S. who know about us has gone up. That\u2019s not just students, alumni and our peer institutions but also the general public. That\u2019s exciting.\u201d\nHere was hard data showing that Chapman\u2019s structured brand marketing campaign, launched in 2018, was succeeding. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell a consistent story,\u201d Ceman says, \u201cYou get lost in the marketplace.\u201d\nThe new national marketing survey found that participants\u2019 knowledge about Chapman went beyond name recognition.\n\u201cMore people than ever know that we have an innovative campus, high-quality academics, a supportive and safe environment,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s important when recruiting students, staff and faculty. Our message is being heard.\u201d\nIn 2022, Ceman was elected to serve on a prestigious committee of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) \u2013 Counselors to Higher Education Executive Committee. She was also honored as a national industry innovator in the Top Women Awards presented by PR News.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWhen it comes to building a national reputation, it\u2019s critical for Chapman leaders to participate at a national level,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that Chapman can be a voice at the table determining how to elevate and support higher education communicators and their institutions.\u201d\nCeman harnesses data to measure Chapman\u2019s burgeoning reputation. She says that her team will use the latest survey results to launch a new campaign. But her role as the self-described megaphone for all things Chapman has meant everything from communicating with students, staff and faculty during the COVID epidemic, to devising student recruitment strategies, to developing and implementing a long-range marketing strategy.\nThere\u2019s\u00a0 no shortage of great things to promote.\n\u201cChapman is large enough to be a powerhouse school, nimble enough to move quickly and be responsive. Across the board, we\u2019re doing unique things,\u201d she says. \u201cResearch has become such a fundamental part of that. It enhances the student experience. Instead of coming to Chapman as an undergrad and doing a basic program, there\u2019s a high likelihood of doing research with a faculty member. That changes your perspective.\u201d\u00a0\n About Jamie Ceman\nPreviously: \u201cI started out in corporate marketing. It was really intense and I learned a lot, but ultimately it wasn\u2019t satisfying,\u201d Ceman says.\nIt\u2019s important to \u2026 \u201cBe working in higher education, as part of a mission-driven organization that\u2019s changing people\u2019s lives and the trajectory of the generations after them. That\u2019s the feeling I want to have at the end of the day, every day.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0Putting Chapman Values into Practice\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that gives context to our work as attorneys in higher education, it\u2019s that we\u2019re generalists who do everything,\u201d says Janine DuMontelle, vice president of legal affairs and general counsel at Chapman University. \u201cAttorneys in private practice often specialize, but we practice in a broad number of fields. That makes Chapman a very exciting legal environment. It\u2019s an innovative university. We\u2019re always leaning forward into cutting-edge stuff.\u201d\nDuMontelle\u2019s knowledge, collegiality and enthusiasm for the many challenges of higher education law take her beyond her responsibilities as legal representative for a major university and head of a strong legal team. This year, the 5,000-plus members of the National Association of College & University Attorneys (NACUA) voted her in as chair of the prestigious organization\u2019s Board of Directors. Her term began in late June.\n\u201cThe mission of NACUA is advancing the practice of higher education law, and there are lots of challenges on a national level in our field this coming year,\u201d she says, citing the areas of health care, admissions, diversity and new Title IX regulations. \u201cAny time an issue emerges, we are ready with high-quality responses from our best experts. On my way to the NACUA conference in June, I was reading 700 pages of proposed Title IX regulations (the landmark civil rights legislation that has opened doors to women and girls at all levels of education).\u201d\nDuMontelle\u2019s position also gives her, and Chapman, a platform for extending the university\u2019s impact. For example, she will be speaking at the 53rd annual conference of the University Risk Management & Insurance Association on transformational strategies for managing risk associated with student health centers.\nDuMontelle also serves on the National Association of Independent Colleges and University\u2019s Legal Services Review Panel. \u201cOn the NAICU panel, I get to weigh in on the amicus briefs that are being filed on behalf of our membership,\u201d she says.\nThe work of\u00a0 the two national groups has never been more important, she says. \u201cWith\u00a0 so many developments, so many changes in higher education, you really need a collective community to be on top of it,\u201d DuMontelle notes.\n\u201cRegulations swing from one set of requirements to another, for example. Major court cases involving other universities or other areas of society also affect us all in higher education. The practice of law at colleges and universities has become more and more dynamic and changing.\u201d\nAbout Janine DuMontelle\nPreviously: DuMontelle spent eight years serving in the administration of the College of Medicine at the University of California, Irvine, and five years preceding that as staff advisor to the City of Long Beach Civil Service Commission.\nIt\u2019s important to \u2026 Mentor undergraduates who work in Chapman\u2019s legal services office. \u201cOne of the things I have been promoting in my peer group is the use of undergraduate students in the legal office,\u201d she says. \u201cI have mentored students and have predominately hired first-generation students. I was a first-generation college student myself and am on the First-Generation Programs Advisory Board here at Chapman. One of the first students I hired is going to Yale Law School in the Fall. We are making a contribution to the development and success of our students.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0Honoring History as a Prelude to Making More\nFor Collette Creppell, it\u2019s an inspiring opportunity to preserve historic local architecture in Old Towne Orange (and beyond) while reimagining a campus that fosters 21st-century learning and innovation.\nChapman\u2019s vice president of Campus Planning and Design is forging partnerships between the university and significant California architectural firms that are shaping the national conversation about campus design.\nOne colorful illustration: Just two months before Creppell arrived at Chapman, the university announced it would take ownership of the imperiled, iconic Santa Monica mosaic \u201cPleasures Along the Beach\u201d by artist Millard Sheets. Under her leadership, the university partnered with Los Angeles-based architectural design firm Johnston Marklee (JML) on plans to nearly triple the footprint of Chapman\u2019s Hilbert Museum of California Art, incorporating Sheets\u2019 sensual midcentury mural on a west-facing wall to capture golden late afternoon sunlight and make the well-known piece of public art visible from trains passing by and to commuters disembarking at nearby Orange station.\n\u201cIt will be an iconic new gateway to the campus and to our wonderful Old Towne Orange community, enhancing the visibility of Chapman University tremendously,\u201d Creppell says. \u201cProjects like this begin to enter the national conversation about architecture and campus design before they\u2019re even completed, because of what they accomplish and because of the national reputation of the firms we\u2019re working with.\u201d\nCreppell has presented the story of the development of Chapman\u2019s Swenson Family Hall of Engineering in the Keck Center for Science and Engineering at recent national meetings of the Society for College and University Planning and of the National Association of College and University Business Officers.\n\u201cInterest in that project has been strong for years now, as people across the country talk about ways to design buildings that encourage collaboration and cross-pollination across disciplines,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not often that universities can accomplish that, as Chapman has with Swenson, where faculty do not have traditional offices and where there\u2019s a wide variety of collaborative spaces for designing and building.\u201d\nAt a recent national conference of the Association of University Architects,\u00a0there was great interest in Creppell\u2019s presentation about Chapman\u2019s new Sandi Simon Center for Dance at the Packing House[AD1] . housed in the historic Villa Park Orchards Packing Plant.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve absolutely celebrated this historical, agricultural, industrial building by preserving the sawtooth roof and clerestory windows that let in northern light \u2013 which is natural light in its most wonderful form,\u201d she says.\nDancers will practice and perform in high-ceilinged, broad spaces that spill out into a courtyard.\n\u201cWe have a beautiful historic building and a high-level dance department to put into the space,\u201d she says. \u201cMost university architects aren\u2019t that lucky.\u201d\nAbout Collette Creppell\nPreviously: Creppell benefited greatly from 10 years as university architect and director of campus planning for Tulane University in New Orleans, eight of them in post-Hurricane-Katrina campus rebuilding and renewal. \u201cIt was an opportunity to figure out what was new and important, rather than building back the way things were,\u201d she says.\nIt\u2019s important to \u2026 \u201cHonor and celebrate history and community while embracing where we are now and where we\u2019re going as a university,\u201d Creppell says.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nAdministration campus planning Collette Creppell features helen norris information technology Jamie Ceman Janine DuMontelle legal affairs strategic marketing \n\n\n\n\n \n\nSari Harrar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39th Chapman Athletics Night of Champions Hall of Fame Inductees\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big Picture: How Data Science and Earth Observation Intersect to Study Climate Risks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Family Donors Make a Collective Impact On Giving Day\u00a0 Thanks to the enthusiasm of the Chapman Family, Chapman University\u2019s fifth annual Giving Day was an unrivaled success.
