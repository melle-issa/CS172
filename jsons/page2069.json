successfully completed at least one semester in a degree-seeking baccalaureate program. The first step in returning to CSUSB is to determine the type\u00a0of Re-Admission Category you fall under. \u00a0Re-admission consideration is based on both the academic standing when you left as well as whether you have attempted units since your enrollment in a CSUSB degree program. Each category has a slightly different application process to return.\u00a0\nStudents that attended CSUSB through special programs and were not considered degree-seeking at the time do not qualify as Returning students. This includes\u00a0High School University, Open University and any programs offered through our College of Extended and Global Education.\nTo help determine your re-admission category you fall under and the admission requirements you will need to complete in order to rejoin our campus we have\u00a0created a chart for you. If you require additional assistance, please feel free to reach out.\nRe-Admission Category Chartasrreturningstudent@csusb.edu\nDegree-seeking students who are on an approved leave of absence\u00a0one or two consecutive semesters do not need to reapply for admission. For more information about a return from a leave of absence, please visit the\u00a0Office of the Registrar website.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning Student\nStudents who stopped attending\u00a0CSUSB and have\u00a0not completed additional coursework since leaving are considered to be Returning Students.\u00a0\nReturning Students must meet GPA requirements\u00a0in order to rejoin our campus.\nTransfer Impaction CriteriaTransfer Deadlines\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are considered a Returning Student if:\n\nYou wish to apply\u00a0to return as an admitted, degree-seeking student to finish a degree in progress OR to begin a new CSUSB degree program.\u00a0\nYou were in good academic standing when you left and your CSUSB cumulative grade point was above 2.0.
