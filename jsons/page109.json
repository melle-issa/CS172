The lab is housed within the Schmid College of Science and Technology and is led by a team of multidisciplinary researchers with expertise in fields such as geology, biology, computer science and statistics.\nThe lab team\u2019s recent studies have focused on the impact of aerosols on the retreat of the Sierra Nevada glaciers in California, the use and validation of satellite observations to assess salinity of the state\u2019s agricultural soils, and drought projections.\n\u201cThe work being done in our Earth Systems Science Data Solutions Lab is not abstract, it provides policymakers with the data to make decisions that affect us all,\u201d said Chapman University President Daniele C. Struppa. \u201cThis is work and cutting-edge technology that has an impact on how we predict, prepare for and respond to drought in our region and globally.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nCiting California\u2019s recent extreme weather, Correa emphasized the need to understand how to predict and prepare for weather on a global scale.\n\u201cThe world is more and more interconnected. The research [being conducted] here will help people around the world survive drought and other cataclysmic events,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0The funding is part of nearly $30 million that Rep. Correa prioritized for community projects throughout the state\u2019s 46th congressional district as part of the Fiscal Year 2023 omnibus appropriations bill approved last year by President Biden. Rep. Correa delivered to Chapman a $1 million grant to fuel the lab\u2019s research in 2022.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nclimate change data analytics Data Science drought Earth Systems Science Data Solutions Lab Lou Correa \n\n\n\n\n \n\nRachel Morrison \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNobel Winner Vernon Smith Honored with First Doti-Spogli Award\n\n\n\n\n\nLaurel Tamayo \u201921 Inspires Climate-Friendly Action Through Film\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Asia-Pacific Initiative Offers Unique Take on Hotbed Region Growing up in Los Angeles, Robert Koepp became fascinated with Asia.
