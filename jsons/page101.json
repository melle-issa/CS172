You\u2019re probably feeling excited, and maybe a little nervous, wanting to meet all the requirements and deadlines for your conditional admission offer. No worries \u2013 we\u2019re here for you with all the resources and opportunities to help you as you begin your Titan experience.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nBe sure to complete the following to meet the conditions of your admission; accept your offer of admission and pay your enrollment deposit.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAll newly admitted students, undergraduate and graduate, are required to accept their offer of admission and pay the non-refundable $250 enrollment deposit (unless you qualify for a deferral). This deposit will offset a portion of your registration fees for your first semester.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nFall deadline:\n\u00a0\n\nMay 1\u00a0for\u00a0\nFreshman and Transfers. Applicants admitted after April 15 have two weeks from the date of admission, printed on the admit letter, to accept their admission offer. Graduate deadline is determined by the Department or by the start of the term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpring deadline:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOctober 31 \n\n\n\u00a0for Transfers. Applicants admitted after October 15 have two weeks from the date of admission, printed on the admit letter, to accept their admission offer. Graduate deadline is determined by the Department or by the start of the term.\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAccept & Pay Now\n\n\n\n\n\nYour browser does not support frames.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I accept admission and pay the enrollment deposit?\n\u00a0Get detailed instructions on how to accept your offer\n.\nAcceptable methods of payment are Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, or electronic check. You will receive an email confirmation once your acceptance and deposit have been accepted. Please note that payments take up to 24 hours to post to your Student Account. You will receive a secondary email, to your CSUF email, once your payment has successfully posted.\u00a0\n\nNOTE:\u00a0Partial payment is not accepted. If partial payment is received,\u00a0it will remain on your student account and your acceptance for admission will not be confirmed until the full $250 is received.\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if my payment does not go through successfully?\n\nIf your payment does not successfully process, we will notify you by email. The email will be sent to your CSU Fullerton email address, which can be accessed through your\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nStudent Portal\n. It is important to note that your acceptance for admission will not be confirmed until you successfully pay your enrollment deposit.\nIf your payment was rejected, most\u00a0likely you entered an incorrect routing number when attempting to pay by electronic check. Please check with your financial institution to get the correct number before you attempt again.\n\n\n\n\nI clicked \"Pay Now\" and nothing happens?\nA payment window should have opened. If it did not, you may need to turn off your pop-up blocker. If you have trouble turning off your pop-up blocker, follow these instructions, turning off Pop-up Blockers\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if I decide not to attend Cal State Fullerton after accepting my admission offer?\n\n\n\nPlease notify the Office of Admissions as soon as possible if you have decided not to attend. If you have already registered for classes, be sure to drop all of your classes. If you were required to pay the enrollment deposit, this amount will be forfeited as the deposit is not refundable. If you choose to consider enrolling at CSU Fullerton in the future, you will need to reapply for admission and meet the admission requirements and deadlines at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat else is required after I have accepted my admission?\n\u00a0\nFor more information visit\n\u00a0\n\nTitan Orientation Programs\n.\n\n\n\n\nHow do I know if I qualify for an Enrollment Deposit Deferral?\nThe enrollment deposit will be deferred for students who meet the following criteria and will be stated in your student portal:\n\nYou have received a Federal Student Aid Report with an Expected Family Contribution of $1000 or less.\u00a0\nYou are a recipient of a Guardian Scholars Program Scholarship, President's Scholars Program Scholarship, or an Athletic Scholarship or if you are a Veteran.\u00a0\nYou are an International student with a full government sponsorship.\u00a0\n\nIf you qualify for an Enrollment Deposit Deferral, next to \"Deposit Deferral\" it will say \"Yes\" as seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site is maintained by \n\t\t\t\t\t\tOffice of Admissions.\nLast Published 4/20/23\nTo report problems or comments with this site, please contact \n\t\t\t\t\t\tarwebmaster@fullerton.edu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 California State University, Fullerton.
