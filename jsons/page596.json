The college provides hands-on graduate-level training for health care professionals in a variety of disciplines. And it turns out these programs aren\u2019t just good for students \u2014 they\u2019re also good for the community.\n\u201cCrean is very much focused on serving and serving well,\u201d says Dr. Naveen Jonathan about the college\u2019s multi-pronged approach to education. Jonathan is the chair of the Department of Marriage and Family Therapy (MFT), which operates the Frances Smith Center for Individual & Family Therapy, Chapman University\u2019s oldest public-facing clinic. The center provides low-cost counseling to more than 200 clients every term, providing both valuable training to students and a much-needed service to the community.\u00a0\n\u201cMany of the clients would not be able to access therapy services without a clinic like ours,\u201d says Jonathan.\nGraduate students, working under the close supervision of licensed marriage and family therapists, work with clients who have been referred by local hospitals, clinics, schools, churches and other local organizations, offering both in-person and telehealth services to Orange County and neighboring Southern California communities.\u00a0\nFor students, the lessons in community impact is just as important as what\u2019s learned during their training, says Jonathan. \u201cHow do you use yourself as a vehicle so that you can transform the lives of others?\u201d he says, echoing the mission statement of the university. \u201cAnd how can you be a global citizen in that way?\u201d\nUnderstanding and Treating the Symptoms of Long COVID\u00a0\nCrean\u2019s newest clinic available to the local community is the Neuro-Deficit Clinic for COVID-19 Survivors. Here, individuals dealing with lingering issues after recovering from COVID-19 can receive no-cost evaluation and treatment services.\u00a0\nThe clinic provides assessment and treatment for people who are functional, going to work and school, but struggling with cognitive and communication issues. Symptoms such as one\u2019s thinking and remembering being affected by fatigue, trouble speaking, trouble reading, listening and communicating at work, school or home can be indicators of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, what is colloquially known as \u201clong COVID.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLots of people have lingering effects from COVID-19 and many of them were not severe enough to be hospitalized. Because of this, they may not have been referred for help or assistance,\u201d says Dr. Mary Kennedy, who oversees the clinic.\u00a0\n\u201cIf they were on a ventilator and hospitalized, they could have problems with long-lasting memory, attention and disorganized thinking. But what we\u2019re also seeing is that even folks who are never hospitalized, folks who have what\u2019s called mild COVID, who were tested but were told to stay home\u2026some of those folks who were never in the hospital, many of them have post-acute sequelae of COVID-19,\u201d she says.\nThe clinic, which opened last fall, can meet with patients in person or via telehealth. Individuals in the community who are dealing with cognitive or communication difficulties following COVID are encouraged to contact the clinic for assessment.\u00a0\nA Helping Hand for Stroke Sufferers\nMFT students also participate in another of Crean\u2019s pioneering clinical services, Stroke Boot Camp, operated by Crean\u2019s Doctor of Physical Therapy program. Stroke Bootcamp is a two-week intensive, interdisciplinary treatment program that provides multi-dimensional, patient-centered care for stroke survivors.\n\u201cTypically, people with chronic stroke have very limited access to any therapies or rehabilitation. They get discharged pretty early on in the process,\u201d says Dr. Alison McKenzie, director of anatomy laboratory operations for the Department of Physical Therapy. \u201cThey don\u2019t usually get to maximize their stroke recovery potential because of the limitations in our health care system. Our goal is to help folks with stroke to be as healthy and as active and as mobile as they possibly can.\u201d\nThe Neuro-Deficit Clinic for COVID-19 Survivors, the Frances Smith Center and Stroke Boot Camp are only three of the many outreach efforts that give students the opportunity to engage with the community. Crean\u2019s Community Exercise Program (CEP) aids patients who are dealing with balance, coordination, neurological and mobility-related impairments, while the Balanced Families program is designed for families with children suffering from Cerebral Palsy and related neuromuscular movement limitations. In addition, graduate students work with local organizations such as the Down Syndrome Association of O.C., the Ritecare Childhood Language Center, and the Clinic in the Park, among many others.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 research Department of Physical Therapy Frances Smith Center for Individual and Family Therapy marriage and family therapy programs Neuro-Deficit Clinic Stroke Boot Camp \n\n\n\n\n \n\nStaci Dumoski \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrean College Student Starts Organization to Help Kids Study STEM\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Elevates Mental Health at Rinker Campus Fair May 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Family Donors Make a Collective Impact On Giving Day\u00a0 Thanks to the enthusiasm of the Chapman Family, Chapman University\u2019s fifth annual Giving Day was an unrivaled success.
