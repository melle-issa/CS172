With more than 4,800 online and in-person donations, the 2023 giving event raised nearly $3.4 million dollars. Showing their tremendous dedication and commitment, more than 650 UC Davis employees donated this Give Day.\nSince the first Give Day in 2017, the fundraiser has been held in conjunction with Picnic Day. This year,\u00a0Development and Alumni Relations\u00a0employees cruised around campus in a pair of cow-themed-decorated golf carts dubbed \u201cFund-Grazers\u201d to whip up visibility and boost support for the event. Donations from alumni, friends, faculty and staff, students, business and community partners and others poured in from 44 states and 13 countries.\n\u201cAfter seven years, Give Day has become an integral part of the Picnic Day experience,\u201d said Shaun Keister, vice chancellor of Development and Alumni Relations, the division responsible for Give Day. \u201cIt provides a wonderful opportunity for donors to show their support for UC Davis across the Davis and Sacramento campuses and beyond.\u201d\u00a0\nUp for the \u2018challenge\u2019\nAs in years past, challenge gifts magnified the impact of donation dollars. Each challenge asked for a specified number of contributions of any size to a particular program \u2014 and, when the threshold is met, the donor or donors behind the challenge \u201cunlock\u201d a larger gift.\u00a0\u00a0\nGive Day 2023 kicked off with more than 214 challenge gifts worth $2.4 million, a notch lower than the 240 challenge gifts worth $2.8 million in 2022. But after a year of high inflation that heavily impacted day-to-day household costs for families, the money raised was impressive and in line with 2021 totals.\n\u201cChallenge gifts spark a chain of giving, with every donor seeing the powerful impact we have when we all come together and join forces,\u201d Keister said. \u201cThis inspiring support emphasizes our greater community\u2019s commitment to UC Davis and their belief that, under Chancellor Gary S. May\u2019s leadership, we are charting a bright and innovative future.\u201d\nBeneficiaries ranged from scholarships, research and emergency funds to innovative experiential learning projects and more, touching every school and college and most units across UC Davis and UC Davis Health.\n\nImage\n \n\nStudents get into the Give Day spirit with Gunrock during Picnic Day.

The School of Veterinary Medicine won the \u201cBattle of the Schools\u201d with 451 gifts \u2014 topping the School of Law who came in second with 221 gifts.\u00a0\nAnother Give Day highlight was achieving full funding for the $25,000 prize attached to the Women & Philanthropy Impact Award that will be presented at an award ceremony on Oct. 22. The recipient of\u00a0the award will direct the prize money to a UC Davis fund of their choice.\u00a0\nBryan Anthony is a senior writer for the Annual and Special Gifts Program in the Office of Development and Alumni Relations, and\u00a0can be reached by email\u00a0or phone, 530-754-0482.\n\n\nShare: \n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we look forward, we look to you.
