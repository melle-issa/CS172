When you are applying for admission to SDSU through Cal State Apply, you are using the California State University common application.\n\nLower Division and Upper Division\nThese terms refer to both courses and students. Lower-division courses are at the 100 or 200 level, and upper-division courses are at the 300, 400 or 500 level. Lower-division students (also known as underclassmen) have completed less than 60 semester units and are usually first-years and sophomores. Upper-division students (also known as upperclassmen) have completed 60 units or more and are usually juniors and seniors. SDSU accepts transfer applications from upper-division students only.\n                  \nCalifornia Residency\nUnder California law, most out-of-state students cannot establish residency to waive nonresident tuition at SDSU. You must prove that you have moved to California for reasons other than your education. Learn about California residency for tuition purposes.\n\n\nWelcome to SDSU\nContact AdmissionsVisitRequest Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyoutube\ntwitter\nfacebook\ninstagram\n\n\n\n\n619-594-5200\n               \t\t\t\t\t\t\t5500 Campanile Drive\n               \t\t\t\t\t\t\tSan Diego, CA 92182\n\nMaps\nParking\n\n\n\n\nCampus Directory\nEmployment\nMedia Relations\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Contact\nNetwork Status\nStrategic Plan\nNewsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nDocument Readers\nDigital Privacy Statement\nCampus Safety Reports\nFeedback\n\n\u00a9 2023 San Diego State UniversityAll Rights ReservedLast Updated\nback to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Updated 8/11/22",
