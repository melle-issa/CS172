Patricia McNair\u2019s honors include four Illinois Arts Council awards, Pushcart Prize nominations in both fiction and nonfiction, a Writer\u2019s Grant and residency at the Vermont Studio Center, a residency at the Glen Arbor Arts Association, and a Writer-in-Residence position at Interlochen Arts Academy. She is an Associate Professor in the Fiction Writing Department at Columbia College Chicago.\nFor those of you who haven\u2019t yet read this marvelous collection, you will be quickly swept away by the unapologetic, blue-collar portraits of each character, compelling you to feel as if you live among them or as one of them. These stories remind us of the smells we wish to forget in her story \u201cWhen is a Door not a Door\u201d:\n\u201cI sat down on the couch next to Emily, scooted over as close as she would allow me to. Close enough that I could smell her, something like cooked carrots and baby powder and sweaty armpits\u201d (52).\nOr perhaps these stories remind us of the tastes we wish to never forget like biting into a big, red, shiny backyard tomato in her story \u201cThe Things That\u2019ll Keep You Alive\u201d:\n\u201c\u2026he selected another from the case and wiped it against his sleeve like he was polishing an apple and bit from it in just the same way. Juice and seeds ran down his chin. He smiled through the scarlet and talked through the pulp\u201d (125).\nPatricia McNair\u2019s writing is buoyant and beautiful. Reading and relishing it is like a gentle breeze. But don\u2019t let the title fool you; these stories are about people, each of whom are at the heart of their own storm\u2014a whirlwind of human weakness, tragedy, and rebirth.\u00a0 Prepare to be windswept by this unforgettable collection. I hope you will join me in welcoming Patricia Ann McNair at the upcoming Writer\u2019s Voice reading.\n\n\n \n\nMarch 26, 2013watershedcsuc Chico, CSU, Patricia Ann McNair, Sabrina Derr, The Temple of Air, Watershed Review, Writer's Voice\n1 Comment\n\n\n\n\nWriter\u2019s Voice Spotlight: Martha\u00a0Collins \n\nThe editors at Watershed Review\u00a0are proud to announce that poet Martha Collins will be reading at the local 1078 Gallery (located at 820 Broadway Street in Chico, CA) as part of the Writer\u2019s Voice Series.
