Stevenson Hall has played such a vital role in the history of the university, including being the first building constructed on campus. We look forward to reopening its doors in Fall 2022, so it may continue to positively serve\u00a0our campus community.\nThe renovated Stevenson Hall will house the Schools of Business and Economics, Education and Social Sciences, and will feature\u00a0state-of-the-art classroom and lecture spaces. The Stevenson Hall renovation is designed to a\u00a0LEED\u00a0Gold sustainability standard, taking advantage of natural sunlight throughout, using green materials and enhancing energy efficiency.\nWe invite you to view our\u00a0Virtual Groundbreaking\u00a0video playlist, with recorded messages, photos, and appreciation for everyone who helped to make this project a reality and success.\u00a0We encourage you to follow the metamorphosis of the building over the next year by visiting the\u00a0Stevenson Hall Renovation Project\u00a0website.\nABOUT US: With a student population of 9,200, Sonoma State is a regionally serving public university committed to educational access and excellence.
