The first step in returning to CSUSB is to determine the type\u00a0of Re-Admission Category you fall under. \u00a0Readmission consideration is based on both the academic standing when they left as well as whether they have attempted units since their enrollment in CSUSB degree program. Each category has a slightly different application process to return.\u00a0\nMore information and resources for Returning CSUSB Students can be found on our webpage.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransfer Student Success Center\nThe Transfer Student Success Center (TSSC) serves as the heart of CSUSB\u2019s transfer student community. The TSSC supports prospective and current transfer students as they navigate the transition to and through CSUSB. The center provides programs,\u00a0events, resources and support services\u00a0created specifically for transfer students. We also offer\u00a0peer-to-peer support through our team of Transfer Peer Mentors. The TSSC seeks to\u00a0ensure that all transfer students find a sense of belonging at CSUSB and are successful in achieving their personal, professional, and educational goals.\u00a0\nVisit the Transfer Student Success Center webpage for more information and to check their schedule of events.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity\u00a0Honors Program\u00a0\n\u00a0The Honors Program supports highly-motivated students as they transition from high school into collegiate studies and provides a community of support throughout their time at CSUSB.

Applicants will also provide two letters of recommendation. The application is completed entirely online and the web-link is provided in the invitation to apply.\nPresidential Academic Excellence Scholarship (PAES)\nThe CSUSB Academic Excellence Program is a competitive program welcoming 20 new students annually. Initiations to apply to the program will be made after students receive their CSUSB admission.\nThis exceptional community experience provides students with supplemental leadership, mentoring and engagement opportunities specific to the Academic Excellence\u00a0Program.

In the current proposal for the program Participants in the program would receive:\n\nA scholarship to support any unmet tuition and mandatory fees beyond what is covered by Federal and State grants, tuition waivers or any other tuition paying programs\nAn annual scholarship for additional educational expenses, including books and other needs\nA one-time award to support a student\u2019s participation in an unpaid leadership, academic or career related internship\nA scholarship to cover the cost of a double occupancy room and a basic meal plan for students who live in the Honors Residential Scholars community during their first year at CSUSB\n\nFor more information about the Presidential Academic Excellence Scholarship, visit their website.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVeterans\nCal State San Bernardino is proud to provide educational opportunities for\u00a0veterans of the military services and their dependents.
