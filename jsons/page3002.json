Answer. Ever. Because the Military Friendly\u00ae designation creates better outcomes for veterans. By setting a standard, then promoting it, we provide positive reinforcement for American organizations to invest in programs that improve the lives of veterans. That\u2019s good for veterans, good for the organizations and good for America.\nMilitary Friendly\u00ae is the standard that measures an organization\u2019s commitment, effort and success in creating sustainable and meaningful benefit for the military community. Now, let\u2019s unpack that. Because every word of that definition was purposefully chosen.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD MORE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMilitarySpouseFriendly\u00ae Employers \n\n\n\nThe Military Spouse Friendly Employers survey investigates and identifies the organizations whose commitment to serving the military and veteran community is comprehensive in scope and meaningful in terms of actual outcomes and impact.

Organizations earning the Military Friendly\u00ae Brand designation were evaluated using public data sources, personal feedback from military community members, and responses from VIQTORY\u2019s proprietary survey.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIEW CURRENT LIST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREQUEST SURVEY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMilitary Friendly\u00ae Supplier DiversityProgram \n\n\n\nA unique aspect of the Military Friendly\u00ae program is its extension across four pillars: veteran employment, military spouse employment, military consumer services and protections, and veteran-owned business supplier diversity programs. The Military Friendly\u00ae Supplier Diversity Program list identifies companies that demonstrate their commitment to the veteran community by the extent to which they include veteran-owned businesses in their supplier diversity programs. These corporations are eager to do business with vetrepreneurs because it's good for their own bottom line. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIEW CURRENT LIST\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREQUEST SURVEY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvisory Council \n\n\n\nMilitary Friendly has a proud legacy of innovation and advocacy on behalf of service members, veterans, and their families.
