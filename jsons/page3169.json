It reads:\"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" Legal Citation: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and its implementing regulation at 34 C.F.R. Part 106 (Title IX)Sex discrimination includes sexual harassment and sexual violence. While it is often thought of as a law that applies to athletics programs, Title IX is much broader than Athletics and applies to all programs at the university. While compliance with the law is everyone's responsibility at Chico State, the Title IX Coordinator has primary responsibility for Title IX compliance. Duties and responsibilities are: monitoring and oversight of overall implementation of Title IX Compliance at the University; including coordination of training and education communications; and coordination with Student Affairs, Human Resources and Academic Personnel on the processing of complaints and grievances alleging discrimination, harassment and/or retaliation to the extent they fall under Title IX and other members of the University community.CSU Policy Prohibiting Discrimination, Harassment, Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Exploitation, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, Stalking, and Retaliation(opens in new window)\u00a0\u00a0 Revised December 24, 2021Notice of Non-Discrimination on the Basis of Gender or Sex (PDF)Myths and Facts about Sexual Misconduct (PDF)Rights and Options for  (PDF)Chico State  (PDF)Victims of Sexual Violence, Dating Violence, Domestic Violence and Stalking (PDF)AnnouncementsTitle IX Statistical Reviews2021-22 Statistical Review of Title IX Reporting Activity (PDF)2020-21 Statistical Review of Title IX Reporting Activity (PDF)2019-20 Statistical Review of Title IX Reporting Activity (PDF)Chico Speaks Survey Final ResultsMore...Employees: Not sure how to tell a victim you have to report?WellCat Safe Place has linked videos and information on their Disclosure Support webpage(opens in new window) that includes do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for friends, faculty, staff, and parents of victims/survivors and the videos \u201cHow to Talk About Rape and Sexual Assault, According to Survivors\u201d(opens in new window) and \u201cThings Not to Say to Someone Who Has Been Sexually Assaulted.\u201d(opens in new window)Full list of announcementsTitle IXTitle IX Coordinator530-898-4949Fax: 530-898-5120titleix@csuchico.edu\u00a0Other ResourcesWellCat Safe PlaceCleryWellCat Counseling CenterWellCat Health CenterCSU, Chico Police Department\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus.
