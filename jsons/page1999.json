Few poets, however, get at that fused space with the essence of the human condition, moving beyond beauty into the sublime to find that extra dimension or flavor like literary umami. Troy Jollimore is one of these poets.\nI was first introduced to Jollimore\u2019s work with his book, At Lake Scugog. I perused the \u201cTable of Contents\u201d to find titles such as \u201cThe Solipsist\u201d and \u201cImperceptibility.\u201d These titles and my vague understanding of Troy\u2019s profession as Professor of Philosophy made my insides lurch and groan. Another poet waxing philosophical, or rather a philosopher waxing poetic . . . great. But my initial hesitation was put at ease after reading that aforementioned poem, \u201cThe Solipsist.\u201d\nJollimore expertly starts the poem with a simple image, a person holding a seashell to their ear, trying to hear the ocean\u2019s \u201csea-song.\u201d He then moves inside the person\u2019s head to relate how we can only ever know the self, that reality is only ever a reflection of the self just like the shell reverberating sounds from inside the ear. Each poem after the next asked me to consider what it meant to be human through the confluence of image, sound, and a healthy dose of humor. (\u201cAdvisory\u201d is downright darkly hysterical in its treatment of warning labels.)\nSyllabus of Errors continues the philosophical and material trends found in Jollimore\u2019s previous collections, but ties the poems together through the use of birds and birdsong\u2014the birds flit from poem to poem as if they were moving among neighboring trees. Whether the subject of a poem or an object of attention within the world of the poem, birds appear all over this book. They ground the reader in the corporeal, and Jollimore\u2019s specific focus on birdsong suggests the essence of life, truth, and art can be understood through music and flight. Sounds abound throughout the collection\u2014true rhyme, near-rhyme, slant-rhyme, alliteration, assonance, and consonance among others are all accounted for. These devices (and poems) evoke a playful spirit that, along with humor, is more than welcome in any poetic existential examination or analysis.\nTroy Jollimore received his Ph.D. in Philosophy from Princeton University in 1999. After leaving Princeton he taught at Georgetown University and UC, Davis. Since 2001 he has taught at California State University, Chico, and was selected as CSU Chico\u2019s Outstanding Professor for the academic year 2009\u20132010. Jollimore\u2019s first collection of poetry, Tom Thomson in Purgatory, won the 2006 National Book Critics Circle Award. At Lake Scugog, his second collection of poetry, was published in 2011, and his latest collection, Syllabus of Errors, was just released in April through Princeton University Press to stunning reviews. His poems have appeared in such publications as Poetry, McSweeney\u2019s, The Believer, and the New Yorker. He was a Guggenheim Fellow in 2013 and was awarded the Theodore Roethke Prize by Northwest Poetry in 2014.\nTroy Jollimore will be reading selections from Syllabus of Errors at the first Writer\u2019s Voice reading of the semester. Please join us for a rousing evening with him, Thursday, October 1st, at 7:30 pm in Ayres 120. Thanks go out to the contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts. Writer\u2019s Voice readings are free and open to the public.\nBy Nicholas Monroe\n\n \n\nSeptember 30, 2015watershedcsuc\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll\n\nDiscuss\nGet Inspired\nGet Polling\nGet Support\nLearn WordPress.com\nTheme Showcase\nWordPress Planet\nWordPress.com News\n\n\nTopics\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nUpcoming Events No upcoming events\nArchives\n\nMay 2022\nMarch 2022\nMay 2020\nOctober 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nOctober 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nApril 2017\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nDecember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nApril 2014\nFebruary 2014\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nAugust 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\n\n \n\nFollow me on TwitterMy Tweets \n\n\n\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
