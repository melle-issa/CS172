Interdisciplinary collaboration is leading to the development of new life-saving devices and therapeutics.\n\n\n\n\nScience and engineering come together to improve lives\nThe USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience is tackling the most critical health issues of our time by transforming how research is conducted. We\u2019re taking down walls that have separated experts in different disciplines fighting the same disease.\n\n\nA hub of medical advancement\nAdvances in the understanding of living systems spurred by the genome revolution \u2013 coupled with improvements in computing technology \u2013 have positioned humanity to make undreamed-of advances in the biological sciences in the near future.\n\n\nAt USC, collaboration leads the way\nWith the tools and infrastructure here, USC is becoming a destination for training the world about how convergence can be applied to medicine, science and engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSC MICHELSON CENTER FOR CONVERGENT BIOSCIENCE1002 West Childs WayLos Angeles, CA 90089(213) 821-9849\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Southern California\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\nNotice of Non-Discrimination\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tContent managed by\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUSC Office of the Provost\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tClose Menu\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome\nAboutToggle submenu \n\n\nGary K.
