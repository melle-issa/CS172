I am confident that his leadership will continue to strengthen the championship culture and stellar team of staff and coaches in our athletics program.\u201d \n\u201cI want to thank President Tom\u00e1s Morales, Vice President Paz Oliverez, and the hiring committee for entrusting me to lead\u00a0this department. I also want to thank Dr. Kurt Patberg with\u00a0Mammoth Sports Consulting,\u201d said Amer. \"I look forward to leading a competitive athletics department where the individuals\u00a0and sports teams serve as a point of pride for the CSUSB campus and community. We will emphasize success\u00a0in the classroom, on the playing fields, and within the community. Go Coyotes!\u201d\nAt CSUSB, he will oversee 10 programs: women\u2019s teams in basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, track and field and volleyball, and men\u2019s teams in baseball, basketball, soccer and golf. The men\u2019s basketball team is coming off its most successful season ever, making an appearance in the NCAA Division II Final Four, and the women\u2019s volleyball team won the NCAA Division II national championship in 2019. The Coyotes are perennial powers in the California Collegiate Athletic Association.\nAmer comes to CSUSB after having served in an executive leadership capacity at California State University, Northridge. Amer joined CSUN in 2018 as the associate athletics director for compliance before being elevated to associate athletic director for administration and operations in February 2019. In that role, Amer oversaw the compliance services office, athletics facilities, events and game day operations,\u00a0the athletics equipment room, and was responsible for strategic planning for the department. Additionally, Amer supervised the baseball, men's soccer, softball, women\u2019s indoor volleyball, women's beach volleyball, women's tennis programs.\nAmer joined CSUN after spending nearly three years working within the Office of Athletic Compliance at the University of Southern California.

It was during his time at UT that Amer helped revive the school\u2019s Sports and Entertainment and Law Society. After moderating the group\u2019s first Sports Law Symposium \u2013 which included a panel discussion with a member of the NCAA Enforcement Staff, a prominent NFL agent, and the then-head coach of the University of Tennessee football team \u2013 Amer identified intercollegiate athletics administration as his preferred career path.\nAmer and his wife, Kallie, have three sons.
