It is the university\u2019s portal for Stanford community news, including messages from university leadership, news about campus life and university affairs, policy updates, new research, upcoming events, and more. Stanford Report\u2019s mission is to communicate the key information that faculty, staff, and students need to thrive in their roles at Stanford, while also delivering feature content that connects them to the university and its vision to ensure equity and inclusion, create a future where humans and nature thrive, explore the boundaries of knowledge, accelerate the application of new knowledge, and prepare students for lives of active citizenship.\nThe Stanford Report newsletter\n\n\nAdvertise in Stanford Report\nThe Stanford community, including schools, departments, and related programs, can advertise in the daily Stanford Report newsletter to faculty, staff, and postdocs. Spots are available for purchase with a PTA on a first-come, first-served basis. The editors reserve the right to determine each ad\u2019s placement.
