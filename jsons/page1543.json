Via my.SDSU students are able to view Financial\n                                    Aid tasks (To-Do Lists), if applicable, and take action for the Fall 2023 - Spring\n                                    2024 aid year.\u00a0\nParents: Due to SDSU's implementation of my.SDSU, the CSU-standard system, parent access\n                                    will be impacted. \u00a0The system as implemented does not support parent access to student\n                                    information, but in the future providing this functionality will be a priority.
