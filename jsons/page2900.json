In Summer 2022, the University began to transition operations to managing COVID-19 on campus in a similar way to how other infectious diseases are managed. That approach continues into the 2022-23 academic year. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, planning is based on expert medical and public health guidance \u2014 if public health conditions change, the University will take appropriate steps at that time.\nAll current information about operations and allowable activities are outlined on the\u00a0Campus Activity Status page, and announcements regarding updates are continually available via the\u00a0Messages to the Community\u00a0page.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Principles for a Healthy Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen planning the ways in which Brown would teach, learn and conduct research in the earliest months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Brown President Christina H. Paxson outlined a set of guiding principles. Those principles, as originally set forth in the\u00a0Plan for a Healthy and Safe 2020-21 now form the basis for Brown\u2019s COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy.\nIn advancing its mission of education and research, Brown is committed to the following guiding principles:\nWe are committed to protecting the health of Brown\u2019s students and employees.\nWe are committed to developing plans with the goal of maintaining the financial well-being of students and employees, especially those who experience the greatest impact.\nWe are committed to protecting Brown\u2019s mission of education and research, including focusing resources on Brown\u2019s highest priorities.\nWe are committed to protecting the long-term financial health of the University.\nWe are committed to transparency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy\n\n\n\n  Brown\u2019s COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy sets minimum standards for all members of the University community to protect the health and safety of all who live, work and study at Brown.\n\n\n\n\nRead the Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvidence\nRI\n02912\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n401-863-1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Navigation\n\n\n\n\nVisit Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA to Z\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Navigation\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareers at Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe campaign for building on distinction\n\nGive To Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Brown University \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown University\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFor You\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Site Navigation\n\n\n\n\nMobile Site Navigation\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthy Brown Home\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Activity Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccinations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisitor and Guest Vaccination Requirement FAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessages to the Community\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Site Only\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of Brown.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthy Brown\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen details for Healthy Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookmark this Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
