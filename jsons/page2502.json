honors, and respects all members of our University community. As stated in\n                              our University Senate statement on diversity, we are a community diverse in race,\n                              ethnicity, language, culture, social class, national origin, religious and political\n                              belief, age, ability, gender, gender identity and expression, and sexual orientation.\n\u00a0\nThis fundamental commitment to diversity:\n\n\n\nEnriches the institution and provides an atmosphere in which all human potential is\n                                          valued.\n\n\n\n\nPromotes learning through interactions among people of different backgrounds and many\n                                          perspectives.\n\n\n\n\nBetter enables the university to prepare all members of its community to promote social\n                                          responsibility, equity, freedom, and productive citizenship in a global society.\n\n\n\nWe are committed to cultivating a campus climate that promotes human dignity, civility,\n                              and mutual appreciation for the uniqueness of each member of our community. Freedom\n                              from discrimination, harassment, and violence against persons or property is a basic\n                              right and is requisite for learning. SDSU commits to protecting Freedom of speech\n                              and encourages all members of the community to promote educational opportunities that\n                              appropriately address acts of intolerance around events that have separated us as\n                              a people.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe also commit to working together to build a more inclusive environment supportive\n                              of the University\u2019s educational mission.

The purpose of the system is to document instances that promote our campus commitment,\n                                       as well as those that fall short. The Division of Diversity and Innovation will use these submissions to identify patterns,\n                                    to recognize and celebrate extraordinary acts of inclusion, and to develop strategies\n                                    for community improvement where needed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Inclusive SDSU Communication System does not replace existing policies or normal\n                  avenues of reporting.\n\n\nInclusive SDSU Form\n\n\n\nNegative Incident Examples\n\n\n\n\nGraffiti in campus bathrooms or facilities that contains messages that put-down or\n                                       degrade groups based on their identities.\nFliers posted on campus that contain messages of bias [unapproved fliers will be removed]\nSomeone proselytizing on campus property and making derogatory comments about groups\n                                       based on their identities\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive Incident Examples\n\n\n\n\nA person receiving an award or honor for their work in advocating for underserved\n                                       communities\nA department or unit that experiences success in improving outcomes for students from\n                                       underserved communities\nA professor of staff member who has dedicated a significant portion of their time\n                                       to mentoring, advising, and supporting students from diverse communities\nA department bringing together different groups to build a cohesive community of support\n                                       and affirmation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport DHR Incidents\n\n\n\nDiscrimination, Harassment, and Retaliation (DHR)\u00a0 Examples\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRacial slurs (verbal and/or written) directed at an individual that\u00a0 unreasonably\n                                       interfere with the individual\u2019s work or education\nDenial of access to certain educational programs or activities based on the individual\u2019s\n                                       membership in a protected class\nRetaliation by a faculty, staff or student due to the individual\u2019s participation in\n                                       a university investigation into unlawful discrimination, harassment or retaliation\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nReport Sexual Misconduct\n\n\n\nSexual Misconduct Examples\n\n\n\n\nUnwanted sexual advances or requests for sexual favors\nPhysical sexual acts against a person\u2019s will or where they were incapable of providing\n                                       consent\nIntimidation, aggression, or hostility based on sex\nStereotypying based on sex\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nConsistent with CSU Executive Orders 1096, 1097 and 1098, if you have experienced\n                  an incident of discrimination, harassment, retaliation or sexual misconduct (including\n                  dating and domestic violence, or stalking), please contact the Title IX Deputy Coordinators\n                  for Students, Faculty, Staff, and visitors or the Deputy Coordinator for Athletics.\nHate Crimes (Hate crimes should be formally reported to the University Police by calling\n                  619-594-1991 or emailing [email\u00a0protected].)\u00a0\nHow are Submissions Handled?\nSubmissions to the system are reviewed by the Inclusive SDSU Communication Team, documented,\n                  and monitored over time.\nThe Inclusive SDSU Communication Team is comprised of trained and caring representatives\n                  from:\n\n\n\nAssociated Students\nCenter for Student Rights and Responsibilities\nCounseling & Psychological\u00a0Services\nDivision of Student Affairs\nDivision of Diversity and Innovation\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Employee Relations and Compliance\nTitle IX Coordinator\nStrategic Communications and Public Affairs\nStudent Ombudsman\nUniversity Police\n\n\n\nThe Team will review communication submissions primarily to assess campus climate\n                  issues and patterns of activity.\u00a0 If the Team believes that further action may be\n                  needed, it may take additional actions.
