Using Duo, a second-layer of security is added on-top of passwords.\u00a0 This helps protect users and the university as passwords are easily compromised.\u00a0\u00a0Duo\u2019s two-factor authentication service protects apps, users, and data by requiring an additional piece of information beyond a username and password. Users will be required to use a device (mobile phone, desk phone, hardware token, etc.) to meet the MFA requirement. Multi-Factor Authentication, also known as Two-Factor Authentication, is quite common today and is an excellent way to provide an additional layer of security to your account. Once enrolled in Duo, end users will receive a push authentication request through the Duo Mobile App, a phone call, or choose to enter a One-Time Passcode (OTP) generated code.\u00a0 Two-factor authentication combines something the user knows (username and password) with something they carry (smartphone, for example) to ensure that if the password has been compromised, that alone will not allow their account information to be accessed.Duo MFA drastically reduces the risk of account compromise and helps protect your data from unauthorized access.\u00a0 MFA has been a security \u201cbest-practice\u201d for several years and helps address security threats before they become a problem.\u00a0 For more information about Duo at Chico State, see our Duo Knowledge Base.Information TechnologyMeriam Library, Room 338www.csuchico.edu/itSupport Our CollegeMore in our divisionComputing & Communication ServicesCreative Media & TechnologyEnterprise ApplicationsInformation SecurityInstitutional Research and Strategic Analytics (IRSA)IT Administrative ServiceIT Support ServicesTechnology Equity and Inclusion\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.Contact UsNeed Help?FacebookFacebookTwitterTwitterInstagramInstagramReport an accessibility issueReport a broken link on this pageTitle IXPrivacy PolicyCalifornia State University, Chico400 West First StreetChico, CA 95929Copyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n",
