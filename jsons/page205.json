The program is supported by OLLI student fees, donations, and the earnings on an initial endowment generously provided by the Bernard Osher Foundation. Joining OLLI at SSU means discovering new friends, new knowledge, and new ways to bring meaning and enjoyment to your life. Courses are taught in six week, three week, and single (2\u00a0 hour)\u00a0sessions (Fall, Winter, and Spring).\u00a0 Summer single course offerings are also available.\u00a0 \u00a0Areas of study range across many subjects:\nArts\nContemporary Issues\nFood & Wine\nNatural Sciences\nSocial & Political History\nWorld Cultures\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\nA Letter from President Lee\n\n\nDecember 2022\nWelcome to the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) of Sonoma State University!\nAs part of the School of Extended and International Education, OLLI expands higher education beyond our degree-seeking students, so that members of the public-at-large can participate in the Sonoma State campus experience.\nThere are many fascinating course topics being offered this year, from Folk Singers to the Bay Area Economy, as well as forays into literature, history, medicine, and political science, just to name a few. The depth and breadth of the courses featured in the pages of this catalog reflect Sonoma State\u2019s commitment to learning as a way of life. There are so many ideas in the world to understand, so many rich historical artifacts and talented people to discover \u2013 and all of it enriching to our experience, especially with the flexibility of either being online or on our beautiful and relaxing campus.\nI hope you are able to take advantage of the opportunities OLLI provides, and please feel free to recommend the Institute to friends and family. You can also help fund an OLLI scholarship by using the enclosed envelope. We look forward to welcoming you to the campus, and hope you enjoy your OLLI learning experience.\nWarmly,\n\nMing-Tung \u201cMike\u201d Lee, Ph.D.\nPresident\nSonoma State University\n\n\u00a0\n\nOnline\u00a0 & Phone Registration\n\nRegister\u00a0online\u00a0up until 5:00 p.m. two days before class at\u00a0olli.sonoma.edu/registration\nRegister by\u00a0phone\u00a0up until 5:00 p.m. the day before the class:\u00a0707-664-2691\u00a0(8:00 a.m. \u2013 5:00 p.m.).\nONLINE (ZOOM) classes: Registered students will receive email with class Zoom link\u00a0the day\u00a0before\u00a0class starts.\nIN PERSON classes: Registered students will receive an email the day before class starts\u00a0with course location, directions, and parking information.
