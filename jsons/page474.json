A: Applicants must have a minimum undergrad GPA of 3.0. This minimum GPA must be met at the time of your application submission. There is no exception to this policy. The GPA recorded on your final bachelor\u2019s degree transcript determines an applicant\u2019s qualification. We feel it would be a disservice to the applicant if we accept below the requirement because graduate programs in Communication Sciences are very competitive. Qualifying GPA will not include post-undergrad grades/coursework.\nQ: Can I work full-time and attend the Post Bacc CSD cohort program? A: Students may choose to work full-time. The program is intensive, so it is up to the student to decide if a full-time work schedule and the Post-Bacc CSD program is manageable.\nQ: I have taken a couple of the courses at another university. Can I transfer these courses? A: No. Our Post-Bacc CSD Program is a cohort program. All students must successfully complete all 10 courses to receive a certificate.\nQ: I just need to take one of the courses you offer. How can I register? A: We do not offer these courses individually.  Q: Is the total amount of tuition due in full before the program begins? A: No. Our program, structured in five-terms (two courses per term), will register students term by term. Payment for each term is due in full before the term begins. We provide a payment schedule.\nQ: Can I apply for financial aid? A: Federal Financial Aid is not available for Post-Baccalaureate students enrolled through an Extended Education program.\nQ: How can I finance my tuition? A: Private loan options are available for this program. Please review the \u201cFinancing Your Education\u201d tab on our website.\nQ: Are GRE scores required? A: For Chapman University\u2019s Post-Bacc CSD program, GRE scores are not required.\nQ: Do I complete the CSDCAS application? A: No. The CSDCAS application is the application for the master\u2019s program.\nQ: On the online application, do I mark part-time or full-time? A: Full-time.\nQ: I have not attended school in quite some time and do not have current connections to provide a recommendation letter from an academic resource. A: Have you volunteered? On the other hand, have you taken a workshop? A supervisor who knows your academic work ethics and/or interest in this program would be an eligible resource.\nQ: Does Chapman University guarantee me spot in the Chapman\u2019s MS CSD program, after I successfully complete the Post-Bacc CSD program with Chapman University? A: No. Successful completion of the Post-Bacc CSD program, does not guarantee admission into Chapman\u2019s CSD graduate program.\nQ: Will my Post-Bacc CSD Certificate from Chapman University, make me eligible to apply to a master\u2019s Communication Sciences and Disorders program at any university? A: Yes.\nQ: Can I apply to graduate school before I finish the program? A: Yes, you may apply, but consider what will make you a strong contender because graduate programs are highly competitive. This is also dependent upon timing of your completion of the Post-Bacc CSD program.\nQ: What makes this Post-Bacc program different from other programs? A: Faculty have real world experience and bring an interesting, insightful, and helpful perspective to the program. Students can assure enrollment of classes and completion of the program in 10 months. This is cohort style model; students begin and end the program together. Classes are Friday evenings and Saturdays.\nQ: How many students per class? A: Average class size is 25-30.\nQ: What is the format of these classes? A: Lecture model with in-class activities and guest lecturers.\nQ: I am almost done with my undergrad coursework. Can I still apply to Chapman's Post-Bacc CSD program? A: You may apply while finishing your undergrad classes. However, completion of all undergrad coursework is required prior to the start of this program. If admitted into the Post-Bacc CSD program, you will receive a \"conditional approval\" until official transcripts are received.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Programs\n\n\nUndergraduate Programs\n\n\nGraduate Programs\n\n\nBridge and Linkage Programs\n\n\nPost-Baccalaureate Certificate in Communication Sciences and Disorders\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest Information\nApply Now\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\nGeneral Inquiries\nAdministrative Assistant\nSarah Benz\n(714) 997-6566pbcsd@chapman.eduProgram Manager, Mary Ellen Hood, MS, CCC-SLP(714) 997-6610hood@chapman.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn The Know\n\n2020 SLP Certification Standards New standards and implementation procedures for the certificate of clinical competence in SLP.
