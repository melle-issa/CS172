Adding a \u201cmetaverse\u201d executive to the faculty; more collaboration with Chapman\u2019s No. 4-ranked film and media college; meeting the growing demand for data analytics; offering a STEM-specialized MBA; a brand-new Asia Pacific initiative.\nAnd that\u2019s just in 2023.\nOr, as Cronqvist put it at Chapman\u2019s 45th Economic Forecast in December, \u201cNo other business school has progressed as much as this business school in such a short period of time.\n\u201cThat said, we have our best years ahead of us.\u201d\nFrom Sweden to American academia\nCronqvist\u2019s own trajectory toward business higher education started in his native Sweden, where he grew up in a town of 2,500.\nHe had been interested in economics and finance \u2013 particularly the stock market \u2013 since high school.\nHe decided to study economics, earning his MS from the Stockholm School of Economics. His thesis advisor there introduced him to some of his former students who had gotten Ph.D.\u2019s in the United States.\n\u201cAlthough I am a first-generation student, I was really intrigued by the prospect of a research career,\u201d Cronqvist said.\n\u00a0In 1999, he began his doctoral work in finance at the University of Chicago. His doctoral advisor was Richard Thaler, who won the Nobel Prize in 2017 for his work in behavioral economics.\n\u201cWorking with him and understanding how he thought about research projects and questions was a defining moment in my career,\u201d said Cronqvist, who witnessed Thaler receive the Nobel in Cronqvist\u2019s home country.\nBehavioral economics became Cronqvist\u2019s academic path. He now studies the behavior of investors and executives \u2013 one of his most recent published pieces is \u201cThe Social CEO.\u201d\n\u201cCEOs, like humans more generally, are a product of their environment, beginning from birth and continuing with the various experiences throughout life,\u201d Cronqvist writes with his co-author. \u201cThe compilation of these experiences determines not only the individual\u2019s human and social aspects but also the policy direction of their firm.\u201d\nFrom local economies, to global partnership, to the metaverse\nAfter Chicago, Cronqvist continued in American academia, teaching finance in the Midwest, China and Southern California. He landed in Florida and rose to vice dean at the University of Miami\u2019s business school.\nAt Miami, he helped implement the school\u2019s own stock index, an idea he is bringing to Chapman.\nThe two indices will track California and Orange County companies using Standard & Poor\u2019s and will be copyrighted to Chapman. Cronqvist said he doesn\u2019t know of another university in the state with a stock index.\n\u201cWhen I joined Chapman, many people told me, \u2018Chapman is a hidden gem in Southern California.\u2019 And I said to myself, \u2018Why do we hide? What are we hiding from?\u2019\u201d he said.\n\u201cSo we are going to move from being a hidden gem to just being a gem.\u201d\nAs a global citizen, Cronqvist believes that Chapman \u201chas gone from a local to a regional institution that is now making a sort of a leap into the national arena and also the global arena.\u201d\nAs an educator and financial expert, Cronqvist gives concrete examples of his vision for how Chapman is making that leap \u2013 while holding to its history of economic research.\n\u201cWe are starting out based on 45 years of economic forecasting with President Emeritus Jim Doti and others,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been a tradition here at the Argyros School of providing very helpful information for businesses that was focusing on local, regional, then national information.\u201d\nPart of Cronqvist\u2019s vision includes the metaverse \u2013 a still-evolving concept of a central virtual world parallel to ours.\u00a0\n\u201cI think the metaverse is an intriguing concept and that\u2019s why we wanted to beef up everything we do around that,\u201d he said.\nHe wants to appoint an esports and gaming executive as \u201cmetaverse executive in residence\u201d who will offer industry panels, career advice and courses.\nThe metaverse \u2013 which encompasses anything in cyberspace and how humans interact with it \u2013 is a multibillion-dollar industry with a range of jobs. Cronqvist said one of Chapman\u2019s career experts was recently \u201cinundated\u201d with inquiries about working in gaming and esports.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest among young people for those products, and we\u2019re in an area of the country where this is a very important industry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be able to meet demand among our students.\u201d\nMeeting industry demand\nCronqvist emphasized how important experiential learning is to him \u2013 \u201cthat we learn not only in the classroom, but also through projects out with real companies, simulation exercises, through team-based education.\u201d\nThis relates to corporate partnerships. Cronqvist wants students to work at businesses that will give them the tools they need for the workforce.\n\u201cWe already have good ties with industries, so we\u2019re broadening and deepening those ties,\u201d he said.\nOrange County\u2019s rich business landscape \u2013 which includes biotech, health care, finance and entertainment \u2013 is ideal for deepening those ties. Many locally based corporations like Disney, Pimco, Chipotle and Edwards Lifesciences already hire Chapman students, looking to innovate to solve challenges and impact the future.\n\u201cA lot of these companies are looking to digitally transform themselves and data has a very important role in that domain,\u201d Cronqvist said.\nChipotle is an example, he said. During the pandemic, the company went from doing very little business online to \u201cbillions,\u201d adapting to collect more information on customers.\nTo meet this exploding demand for data, Argyros is exploring offering a new master\u2019s degree in business analytics. It will be \u201crelated to topics around data science, data analytics \u2013 machine learning, artificial intelligence, visualization of data,\u201d Cronqvist said.\nHe is working on partnering with Chapman\u2019s Schmid College of Science and Technology and Fowler School of Engineering for related courses, and for another new Argyros offering: a STEM-certified MBA.\n\u201cIf you look at the job market, the kind of jobs that are out there that are well paying, many of them are quantitative analytics, making sense of data,\u201d he said.\nHollywood and beyond\nA related collaboration Cronqvist is working on is a new business of entertainment minor, through which he envisions capitalizing even more on Chapman\u2019s proximity to Hollywood.\n\u201cChapman is known for its No. 4-ranked Dodge College of Film and Media Arts, and that\u2019s all some people may know about Chapman, right?\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is a concrete example of how we integrate two schools.\n\u201cThere are many different roles that are involved in Hollywood \u2013 it\u2019s not only the directors or the producers,\u201d he said, adding that the industry needs people in areas like finance and other positions on the business side of entertainment.\nChapman already offers a joint MFA/MBA program. In November 2022, Cronqvist and Dodge Dean Stephen Galloway interviewed DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg.\nCronqvist is also looking beyond Tinseltown toward another facet of global business \u2013 Asia-Pacific commerce.\n\u201cThe idea is that we will be a provider of thought leadership research that will be helpful to businesses, in terms of understanding what\u2019s going on in Taiwan, what\u2019s going on in mainland China, what\u2019s going on in Vietnam,\u201d he said. \u201cHow will what\u2019s going on there impact businesses \u2013 we want to take leadership in this particular domain.\u201d\nHe said the new Asia-Pacific Geoeconomics and Business Initiative will differ from those at other universities by focusing on the effects of countries\u2019 business policies, rather than the region\u2019s politics or culture.\n\u201cThere\u2019s many aspects of the Asia-Pacific region that business leaders would want to understand what\u2019s going on, and we will fill that gap,\u201d he said.\nMore about the impact of Argyros School of Business and Economics\nDoti Foresees Recession in 45th Economic Forecast | Chapman Newsroom\nScholars Represent Chapman at Prestigious Economics Conference | Chapman Newsroom\nChapman Hosts \u2018Shark Tank\u2019-Style Panther Cage Match | Chapman Newsroom\nArgyros Dean Publishes Article on \u2018Social CEO\u2019 | Chapman Newsroom\n\n\nArgyros School Argyros School of Business and Economics Asia-Pacific data analytics Dodge College of Film and Media Arts leadership MBA metaverse \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJoy Juedes \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Launches Most Ambitious Fundraising Campaign to Date, Announces Major Gift\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool of Pharmacy Honored for Collaborative Residency Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Asia-Pacific Initiative Offers Unique Take on Hotbed Region Growing up in Los Angeles, Robert Koepp became fascinated with Asia.
