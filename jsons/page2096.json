The Broadway-style show features singing, dancing and musical performances from College of Performing Arts students.\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, none of the dancers were in the last production, held in 2019. And they are the last group of students who will participate in Chapman Celebrates.\nAt the same time, they and incoming classes can use the new Sandi Simon Center for Dance, which will officially open in March.\nAnd there is another full-circle element \u2013 several of the performers received the Chapman Celebrates talent scholarship, which stems from the funds raised by the event.\nStudents rehearse for the last Chapman Celebrates performances during January Interterm.\n\u201cThis is my first time being in the new space,\u201d says dance major Remington Christensen \u201924. \u201cSo it\u2019s just a good combination of events because I\u2019m getting to do Chapman Celebrates for the first time, which is extremely exciting.\u201d\nHe says scholarship funds made it possible for him to attend Chapman.\n\u201cIt\u2019s given me the opportunity to continue my passion,\u201d says Christensen, who is from Pendleton, Oregon. \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about working with two or three jobs, because I have the scholarship and can focus on school.\u201d\nDance major Kevin Ivins \u201924, who is from the south side of Chicago, was in a similar situation.\n\u201cChapman was one of my dream schools,\u201d he says. \u201cThe scholarship just really helped my family.\u201d\nHe says Chapman representatives told him, \u201cwe want you to focus on your education and not use money or financial stability as the No. 1 reason you can\u2019t come to this school.\u201d\nFullerton resident David Burn \u201926 grew up wanting to attend Chapman. He also received the talent scholarship.\n\u201cI\u2019m so very appreciative and grateful,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m excited to be a part of the show that gave me this opportunity.\u201d\nDance major Valentina Marcano \u201924 says there were not many college dance programs \u201cthat offer the range of opportunities that Chapman does.\u201d\nLike her dance classmates, finances were a challenge \u2013 but she still wanted to go to Chapman. She got an academic scholarship.\n\u201cEverything that\u2019s gone into Chapman Celebrates has helped students in my position,\u201d says Marcano, who is from Goodyear, Arizona.\nShe was cast in the 2022 Chapman Celebrates production, which was canceled because of the pandemic.\n\u201cI learned the first minute and a half, two minutes of the piece,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that was a big challenge last year because that was coming straight from COVID \u2026 and then scratch that, we\u2019re done \u2013 there\u2019s not going to be a show.\u201d\nWhen the 2023 production took shape, she decided to participate.\nAfter the show ends, says Christensen, he\u2019ll have the camaraderie and memories.\n\u201c(Seeing) how much work we put into make that performance is what I treasure, because it teaches me there\u2019s so much more than the performance.\u201d\n\n\nChapman Celebrates Chapman Celebrates scholarship Chapman COPA College of Performing Arts dance Sandi Simon Center for Dance student scholarships talent scholarship \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJoy Juedes \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack History Month Events at Chapman University\n\n\n\n\n\nSandi Simon Center for Dance Opens for Students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle Tanimura \u201923: Leadership That Spans the Campus Jack of all trades Kyle Tanimura is leaving quite the lasting mark on Chapman, where he has taken on multiple leadership roles as a double major in political science and strategic and corporate communication, with a...\n\n\nMay 1, 2023 Jennifer Winfield\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Pacific Islander Desi American Heritage Month Events at Chapman University Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Heritage Month, which runs from May 1 to 31, celebrates the identities, histories and experiences of the APIDA community.
