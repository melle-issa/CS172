We specialize in being fully present with you in your experiences and feelings. Whatever they may be.\nChaplaincy recognizes there's more to a person than the body and mind, there's also matters of the heart.\nYou are welcome in your full authenticity. This is a space where you don't need to perform. You are simply invited and encouraged to show up as you are, however that might be. We are here to hold confidential space for you to be seen and heard.\nAnnanda Barclay, our Higher Education Chaplain Fellow will initiate for your first session.
