Each year, SDSU provides more than 36,000 students with the opportunity to participate in an academic curriculum distinguished by direct contact with faculty and an international emphasis that prepares them for a global future.\n\nHISTORY, MISSION & LEADERSHIPHistory & MissionLeadership\n\nSDSU is the oldest higher education institution in San Diego, uniquely situated only 30 minutes north of the U.S.-Mexico border on Kumeyaay land. Our community is fully committed to excellent teaching, meaningful research and service to our regional community and others we serve throughout the state, across the nation and internationally.\nWe have an incredible past, and a powerful future ahead of us, marked by:\n\nA five-year strategic plan, \u201cWe Rise We Defy: Transcending Borders, Transforming Lives,\u201d launched in 2020.\nThe development of SDSU Mission Valley, a mixed-use, medium-density development that is transit-oriented and that will expand the university\u2019s educational, research, entrepreneurial, and technology transfer programs.\nThe expansion of the border-connected SDSU Imperial Valley, which has been infused with new investments to introduce new programs and student services.\nThe growth of SDSU Global Campus, which is growing educational access to adult learners through the creation of new degree programs.\nOur campus diversity being our pride. SDSU is recognized for its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. About 54 percent of students are of color, the university recognized for our military and veteran program and ranked as a top college for LGBTQ students.\n\nFor generations, SDSU has overcome hurdles and defied expectations, forging ahead to deliver academic excellence, student success and groundbreaking research. We will continue to do so as we build SDSU\u2019s new chapter of inclusive opportunity for more students, reimagining a university designed to thrive for many years to come, and impacting San Diego, our border region, and the world as never before.\n\nSPOTLIGHTLAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nSDSU formally recognizes Native and Indigenous peoples as traditional stewards of the land on which our university resides, and respects the enduring relationship that exists between Indigenous peoples and their ancestral territories.
