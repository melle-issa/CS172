But at the same time, I like to be specific. \u2026 I say this because there was a time I did not identify with feminism,\u201d Davis said, noting that when she published a book called \u201cWomen, Race and Class,\u201d people started referring to her as a feminist. \u201cI was writing about Black women, women of color. And my response was, \u2018I\u2019m not a feminist. I am a revolutionary Black woman.\u2019\u201d\nDavis said she had initially associated feminism with middle-class women and white women. \n\u201cBut what I want to say to you this afternoon is that working class women, women of color from many different ethnic and national backgrounds have helped to shape feminism,\u201d she said. \nThe term most linked to feminism, she said, is intersectionality.\n\u201c(That term) came largely from women of color, radical women of color and also working-class white women who wanted to think about feminism as connected to the transformation of our social, economic and political worlds,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, when I say I want to think broadly, I want to be very inclusive, but at the same time, I want to insist that the feminism that is most valuable is the feminism that is anti-racist. And the feminism that is anti-capitalist. And the feminism that is internationalist.\u201d\nThe audience erupted in applause.\n\n\nThe event was moderated by Angie Otiniano Verissimo, CSUSB associate professor of health science and human ecology, and Alexandra Thambi, biology major and chair of the\u00a0SMSU\u00a0board of directors.\n\n\u201cI tend not to want to pull one issue out and just say, \u2018This is the most important,\u2019\u201d she clarified. \u201cBecause I think feminism methodologies urge us to grasp, to apprehend relationships, relationalities. That\u2019s what intersectionality is about. It\u2019s about recognizing that one cannot fully understand what gender means without taking race into consideration. One can\u2019t understand race without taking gender into consideration.\u201d\nDavis said that if she was compelled to choose one issue, it would be the environment, noting the need to rescue the earth from \u201cthe onslaught of the billionaire capitalists who see profit as more important than saving the plants and saving the animals,\u201d which includes humans. \n\u201cIf we can\u2019t save the earth, then none of the work we are doing around justice for workers, justice for women, and gender nonconforming people, justice for trans people, none of that will matter,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, let\u2019s keep that in mind. I always like to talk about the environmental movement and environmental justice as ground zero of social justice. If we can\u2019t achieve that, then none of our progress in other areas will ultimately be significant.\u201d\nDavis said her motivation stems from her family, including her mother and her mother\u2019s best friend, and the many people she has connected with over the years. \n\u201cI know a lot of people who have devoted their entire lives to struggles to make life more livable for all of us,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, I guess am motivated by that. And the fact is I don\u2019t know how to be any different. I wouldn\u2019t know how to live if I weren\u2019t also attempting to help make the planet a better place.\u201d\nStudents, faculty and members from the community, including Ben Reynoso, councilmember for the city of San Bernardino, participated in the question-and-answer session, which introduced a wide variety of topics of discussion, including afro-pessimism, voting and the Palestinian struggle.\n\n\nAhlam Muhtaseb, CSUSB professor of media studies, asked Davis a question about her \u201ccommitted, unwavering, radically principled stance on Palestine.\u201d\n\nFollowing the discussion, a book signing with Davis was held in the SMSU South Fourplex.\nThis was Davis\u2019 second visit to CSUSB. She last spoke on campus in February 2010 at an event hosted by the Women\u2019s Resource Center, which was attended by more than 700 students and guests.\nThrough her activism and scholarship over many decades, Davis has been deeply involved in movements for social justice around the world. Her work as an educator \u2013 both at the university level and in the larger public sphere \u2013 has always emphasized the importance of building communities of struggle for economic, racial and gender justice.\nDavis\u2019 teaching career has taken her to San Francisco State University, Mills College and UC Berkeley. She also has taught at UCLA, Vassar, Syracuse University, the Claremont Colleges and Stanford University. Most recently she spent 15 years at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where she is now Distinguished Professor Emerita of History of Consciousness \u2013 an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program \u2013 and of Feminist Studies.\nDavis is the author of 10 books and has lectured throughout the United States as well as in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and South America. In recent years a persistent theme of her work has been the range of social problems associated with incarceration and the generalized criminalization of those communities that are most affected by poverty and racial discrimination.\nShe draws upon her own experiences in the early \u201970s as a person who spent 18 months in jail and on trial (she was acquitted by a jury), after being placed on the FBI\u2019s \u201cTen Most Wanted List.\u201d She also has conducted extensive research on numerous issues related to race, gender and imprisonment.\nHer books include \u201cAbolition Democracy\u201d\u00a0and \u201cAre Prisons Obsolete?,\u201d and two books of essays entitled \u201cThe Meaning of Freedom\u201d\u00a0and \u201cFreedom Is a Constant Struggle: Ferguson, Palestine, and the Foundations of a Movement.\u201d Her most recent books include a re-issue of \u201cAngela Davis: An Autobiography and Abolition. Feminism. Now.,\u201d with co-authors Gina Dent, Erica Meiners and Beth Richie.\nTwice a vice presidential candidate on the Communist Party USA ticket, Davis is a founding member of Critical Resistance, a national organization dedicated to the dismantling of the prison industrial complex. Internationally, she is affiliated with Sisters Inside, an abolitionist organization based in Queensland, Australia, that works in solidarity with women in prison.\nLike many educators, Davis is especially concerned with the general tendency to devote more resources and attention to the prison system than to educational institutions. Having helped to popularize the notion of a \u201cprison industrial complex,\u201d she now urges her\u00a0audiences to think seriously about the future possibility of a world without prisons and to help forge a 21st century abolitionist movement.\n\n\nA book signing with Davis followed the discussion.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore: \n\n\nAngela Davis\n\n\nFeminism\n\n\nintersectionality\n\n\nsocial justice\n\n\nenvironmentalism\n\n\nracism\n\n\ntalk\n\n\nkeynote\n\n\nAngie Otiniano Verissimo\n\n\nhealth science and human ecology\n\n\nAlexandra Thambi\n\n\nbiology\n\n\nSMSU\n\n\nSantos Manuel Student Union\n\n\nDEI\n\n\nDiversity Equity and Inclusion\n\n\nPresident\u2019s Diversity Equity and Inclusion Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 12, 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFaculty in the News, April 12\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 7, 2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAmerican political activist, Angela Davis, to speak at CSUSB \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView All News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Region\n\n\n\nCSUSB\n\n\nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino\n5500 University Parkway\nSan Bernardino, CA 92407\n+1 (909) 537-5000\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Social Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso of InterestSan Bernardino Public  University Graduate StudiesSan Bernardino University AdmissionFinancial Aid and Scholarships in San Bernardino \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1 \n\n\n\n\nLogin\n\n\n\n\nmyCoyote\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\nStudent Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB  \nDrupal Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Interest to...\n\n\n\n\nFuture Students\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Students\n   Interests\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nFull-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nPart-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & Visitors\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nAlumni & Friends\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Partners\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nMilitary/Veterans\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 2 \n\n\n\n\nEmployment\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB \nJob Listings\n - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nFaculty Jobs\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nCareer Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHuman Resources\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Employment\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nContact\n  CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nClery Act\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Safety Reports\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTitle IX Notice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure of Consumer Information\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 3 \n\n\n\n\nCampus Services\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Advising\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHousing & Residential Life\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nOmbuds Services\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nParking\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPolice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPsychological Counseling\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nServices to Students with Disabilities\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Health Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Support\n\n\n\n\nTranscripts\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\n\n\n\nNon-Discrimination Notice\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Copyright/DMCA Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
