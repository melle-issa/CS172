There is also a bundle which is currently available at a reduced price that combines all individual extensions as well as all future extensions that we are going to release.\nTo kick things off, we are starting with the following extensions for Kirki PRO:\n\nTabs\nInput Slider\nResponsive Controls\nHeadlines & Dividers\nMargin & Padding Control\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at each of the extensions.\n\nTabs\nAs the name suggests, the Tabs extension allows you to organize your controls tabs. This makes sense on panels with tons of controls to better categorize your theme options.\nA great use case would be to combine layout & design options into their respective tabs as shown on the gif below.\n\n\nResponsive Controls\nResponsive Controls is one of the most powerful Kirki PRO extensions. It allows users to choose a value for desktops, tablets & mobile devices individually.\nWith the Responsive Controls extension, the following controls can be converted into responsive controls:\n\nColor\nCheckbox\nSwitch\nToggle\nDimension\nDimensions\nImage\nNumber\nSlider\nInput Slider\nMargin & Padding\n\nExample of a responsive color field\n\nInput Slider\nThe Input Slider is a hybrid control that combines the slider control & input field. This makes for a much better user experience. In addition to that, the Input Slider allows for all possible units as shown on the screenshot below.\nInput Slider example\n\nMargin & Padding\nKirki already comes with the Dimensions control. Though, a dedicated Margin & Padding control makes much more sense if you don\u2019t want your users to have the ability to mess with units. Instead, you provide the unit for them in one convenient & easy to use control.\n\n\nHeadlines & Dividers\nThe Headlines & Dividers extension is another great tool to further optimize the user experience for your customers in the WordPress customizer.\nWith lots of options, the customizer panel gets cluttered quite easily. This extension will allow you to categorize & structure your controls with Headlines, Dividers & Headline Toggles.\nHeadline & Headline Toggle example\nDivider example\n\nLaunch Offer \ud83d\ude80 \u2013 Grab it while it lasts!\nAs a part of our launch offer, all Kirki PRO extensions can currently be purchased as a bundle.\nIt is not only available at a reduced price, it will also include all future Kirki PRO extensions.\n\nBut hurry up, the price for the bundle will go up soon!\nIn fact, we might remove the bundle after the initial launch period. Learn more about the Kirki PRO bundle & all individual extensions.\nGrab it while it lasts!\n\nBrowse Extensions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Comments \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBernd\n\n\n\n\n\n March 10, 2022\n\n\n\n\nAlways great to see that good extensions become successful and getting bought by a big company that squeezes every little bit out of the damn customers. I already pay around 900\u20ac per year for a couple of extensions for one site.\nA few hundred bugs for a function i barely use, sounds awesome.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Vongries\n\n\n\n\n\n March 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\nHi Bernd,\nThank you for sharing your concerns \u2013 I\u2019m happy to address them.\nWe have put pretty much all our resources into Kirki 4 the past 6 months.\nWith Kirki PRO we are bringing some more advanced features such as responsive controls, tabs & more to theme developers. Lots of these features were developed based on personal needs & more importantly: customer feedback.\nFrom your comment it sounded like you might not actually need Kirki PRO. Those new features are geared mainly towards theme developers that build free & commercial themes. This would rarely make sense on a single-site project imho.\nKirki PRO has been very well received & we are excited to bring some more features to bundle owners, as well as release additional extensions in the near future.\nIf there are any controls or features you would love to see next, please let us know.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlenton\n\n\n\n\n\n September 19, 2022\n\n\n\n\nGlad to see this plugin is growing as it\u2019s really the only plugin that does what it does. I hope to see Kirki start making it\u2019s way into Gutenberg block editor as there is no intuitive way for theme and plugin devs to add UI controls to blocks.\nIs this something on Kirki\u2019s radar? Seeing as FSE (Full Site Editing) appears to be leaving the customizer behind.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neric\n\n\n\n\n\n September 30, 2022\n\n\n\n\ngood point\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
