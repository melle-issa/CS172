As a community, we work together to address the usability and accessibility of the websites contained within our web environment.Our goal is that all campus websites meet the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0 AA). All campus and community members play a part in creating accessible, usable information.Campus Web Accessibility StatementWeb Services is continually working to create a more accessible framework for campus sites in the Cascade web content management system (WCMS). The framework has been built using code compliant with W3c standards for HTML and CSS.The accessibility of the content within those sites is the responsibility of site owners and content maintainers. Neither campus users nor Web Services is permitted to upload inaccessible content to any campus website\u2014this includes inaccessible PDFs and Word documents, uncaptioned videos, or graphics with insufficient contrast, among other things.Cascade sites are automatically checked every month using Siteimprove, and reports are sent to website owners and content maintainers. Key web pages are manually checked every six months.Sites outside of the Cascade WCMS are not provided by Web Services. The owners of these sites strive to adhere to the same guidelines and standards as the campus web. For more information, see the\u00a0Campus Web Accessibility Plan.We are dedicated to continual improvement. Please report an accessibility issue if you experience any difficulty accessing the content on any Chico State site.Students, instructors, employees, and campus visitors are encouraged to contact the Accessibility Resource Center for accessibility accommodations, training, and partnerships related to any aspect of campus life.\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.Contact UsNeed Help?FacebookFacebookTwitterTwitterInstagramInstagramReport an accessibility issueReport a broken link on this pageTitle IXPrivacy PolicyCalifornia State University, Chico400 West First StreetChico, CA 95929Copyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n",
