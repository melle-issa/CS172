By participating, patients take an active role in their own care and add to our knowledge so that we can create a healthier world.\nAs an academic health system,\u00a0UCI Health\u00a0is uniquely positioned to advance medicine through leading-edge research and\u00a0clinical trials\u00a0for all diseases and conditions. Our\u00a0Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center\u00a0\u2014 one of only 53 National Cancer Institute-designed comprehensive cancer centers in the nation and the only one based in Orange County \u2014\u00a0plays an active role in discovering new treatments for cancer. It has more than 300 active clinical trials, many of them early-phase studies designed to test new therapies.\nUCI Health also offers the full spectrum of noncancer clinical trials for everything from heart disease, neurological disorders, visual impairment, skin conditions and more. It also offers leading-edge stem-cell trials through the UCI Alpha Stem Cell Clinic, which is part of the\u00a0California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) network and is affiliated with the Sue & Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center.\nFind a clinical trial \u203a\nCenter for Clinical Research\nThe\u00a0UCI Center for Clinical Research\u00a0oversees clinical trials for UCI Health and the UCI School of Medicine. Please visit the center's website to learn about clinical trials.\nClinical trial facts\n\nPatients are closely monitored and their safety is paramount, and your physician will always review your treatment.\nMany patients benefit from new treatments not available to the general public.\nEvery trial has criteria that describes eligibility, and the criteria differ from trial to trial.\nEvery trial has a plan, or protocol, that describes the study, what to expect, risks and benefits.\nClinical trials are open to everyone, regardless of age, ethnicity or gender, so long as the participant meets the eligibility requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Trials FAQ\nFrequently asked questions about clinical trials \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient Safety\n\n\nHow we protect patients who participate in clinical trials \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Trial Benefits\n\n\nWhy clinical trials are so important \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancer Center Newsletter\n\n\nView our Fall 2020 newsletter highlighting stem cell transplants and clinical trials \u203a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatients\n\nMyChart Login\nCOVID-19 Information\nClasses & Events\nClinical Trials\nFind a Provider\nHealth Library\nInsurance\nMedical Records\nMedical Services \nPay Bills Online\nPricing Transparency\n\n\n\nPhysicians\n\nInfection Prevention\u00a0\nRefer a Patient\nTransfer a Patient\nPhysician Directory\nContinuing Medical Education\n\n\n\nVisitors\n\nVisit UCI Medical Center\nLocations \nParking\nContact a Patient\nDining\nGift Shop\nVisiting Hours\nWaiting Areas\nVirtual Tour\nDonate Blood \n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\nAbout UCI Health\nCareers\nCompliance\nContact Us\nGiving\nHuman Resources\nLive Well Blog\nLive Well Magazine\nNondiscrimination\nPricing Transparency\nQuality & Safety\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect with Us\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload our free app on your phone for easy access to health information and tools.\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUCI Health | 101 The City Drive South, Orange, CA 92868 | 714-456-7890 \n\n\n\u4e2d\u6587\n|\nEspa\u00f1ol\n|\nti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t\n|\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\n\n\nBack To English\n\n\n\n            \u00a9 2023 The Regents of the University of California.
