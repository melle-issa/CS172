My dad did pass away, three weeks ago from when I first started writing this. And I was prepared to write his eulogy, had even asked a friend for examples of eulogies she had written to use as a basis, because I had never written one before. My sister and I had agreed we would deliver it together, every other\u00a0paragraph, but I would craft the words.\nBut I never wrote the eulogy for his funeral, and the reason is this: my dad was an independent thinker until the end. Take, for example, the only thing of his I took home to California with me from Minnesota. My mom said it was the last purchase he made: a coffee mug that has a list of English words and phrases that, grammatically, are often confused. \u201cYou\u2019re\u201d and \u201cYour,\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re\u201d \u201cTheir\u201d and \u201cThere,\u201d etc. For each word or phrase, the coffee mug provides an explanation of its proper use\u2014but each explanation incorporates the expletive fuck. \n\u201cYou\u2019re = You Fucking Are. Your = Shows Fucking Possession.\u201d\n\u201cCould\u2019ve = Could Fucking Have. Could Of = You\u2019re a Fucking Idiot.\u201d\nI took the coffee mug because my dad, like lots of fathers, had sayings he would use over and over again. The world is just a bunch of assholes and idiots, was one of his favorites. Don\u2019t take any wooden nickels, another expression of his general distrust in humanity. But a lot of them were also grammar-related, because my dad, like his dad, had a deep love of English, and he took any accidental misuse of it not only as an assault against language as an institution, but also as some kind of personal insult. Thus, as a child, if I finished my dinner and announced, I\u2019m done! my dad would clear my plate and reply, Cakes are \u2018done,\u2019 people are \u2018finished.\u2019 A lesson in superlatives was squeezed into a rhyme that I hope to someday cross-stitch onto a pillow: Good better best, never let it rest\u2014until your good is better, and your better is best. If I ever used a word incorrectly, my dad would let me know immediately, and tell me to Go look it up in your Funk & Wagnall\u2019s. And if in a fit of teenage rage I ever said, YOU\u2019RE the one that\u2019s being unfair! he surely would have replied, who\u2019s.\nThat coffee mug is sarcastic, hilarious, smart and irreverent, just like my dad. And it\u2019s completely fitting that it\u2019s the last purchase he ever made. This is the man whose last email to the family from his deathbed was not to express remorse or love or final wishes\u2014but to complain about Trump. trump thinks Jackson would have prevented the civil war, per a CNN report tonight. Don\u2019t know trump\u2019s point on that. going off the deep end, he is. And the entire reason why I never delivered his eulogy was because he never had a funeral\u2014he expressly told my mother and my aunt that he did not want one.\nHalf of the reason he never had a funeral was because he had his body donated to science, which I find incredibly cool. The other half is because around the age of sixty-three, my dad stopped believing in God. After growing up the son of an Episcopalian reverend, as an altar boy in an Episcopalian church, and living his adulthood as the brother of an Episcopalian reverend\u2014believing in the Bible and practicing the golden rule his entire life\u2014my dad decided in his twilight years that it was bogus. I talked to him pretty extensively about it, because where most people would seek comfort in religion at his age, my dad rejected any promise of an afterlife, because it stopped making sense to him.\u00a0\u00a0 After years of struggles, he no longer saw any evidence that Jesus was looking out for him, and rather than dig his heels into the dirt and insist that Episcopalism was going to save him someday, he simply changed his mind.\nI saw his flexibility of heart at another very poignant moment between the two of us. He was so proud when, as a grad student at Chico State, I was hired to teach freshman composition, a class where first-year students are taught how to write academic papers. He assumed his progeny was going to make sure that teenagers in California would know that cakes are \u2018done,\u2019 people are \u2018finished.\u2019 And in a heartbreaking conversation, I had to explain to my dad that grammar is no longer taught to first-year college students.\nThen how do they learn to WRITE? he asked incredulously.\nI described how we are taught to edit their papers for organization and clarity, how forming an argument and supporting it with facts is top priority. But if we see grammar that is not prescriptive, we are not supposed to alter it unless it\u2019s unclear writing.\n\u201cPrescriptive\u201d? he asked.\n\u201cProper English,\u201d I said. For example, a student growing up in a household where both English and Spanish are spoken likely uses a form of English that old-school grammarians wouldn\u2019t consider \u201ccorrect,\u201d but as instructors we honor whatever language they use, as long as their ideas are clear.\nAnd you agree with this?\nI didn\u2019t at first, but now I do. My dad sighed. It took a few more conversations, but in the end, he actually came around. He was able to accept that his ideas of language\u2014concepts that to him were literally more holy than religion\u2014were changing, and he was willing to change with them.\nThis is what I mean when I say that my dad was an independent thinker until the end. I hope, if I have learned anything from him, it\u2019s how to be a cork in the stream, to bend and not break, to be elastic in my ideas forever, and to keep a sense of humor through it all. Because there is a vital difference between losing, and being loose.  Or, as his coffee cup will remind us:\n\u201cLose = Cease to Fucking Keep. Loose = Not Fucking Fixed in Place.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWritten by Marta Shaffer (with unwavering help from Jenna Roebuck)\n\n \n\nJanuary 22, 2018watershedcsuc\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll\n\nDiscuss\nGet Inspired\nGet Polling\nGet Support\nLearn WordPress.com\nTheme Showcase\nWordPress Planet\nWordPress.com News\n\n\nTopics\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nUpcoming Events No upcoming events\nArchives\n\nMay 2022\nMarch 2022\nMay 2020\nOctober 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nOctober 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nApril 2017\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nDecember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nApril 2014\nFebruary 2014\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nAugust 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\n\n \n\nFollow me on TwitterMy Tweets \n\n\n\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
