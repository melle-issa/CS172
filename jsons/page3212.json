She\u2019s so amicable and charming, with so many thoughtful insights.\u201d\nBroadcast journalism student Tess Martinelli \u201924 meets Nadia Murad before interviewing her.\nSince last summer, when Murad began a three-year appointment as Presidential Fellow in Peace Studies at Chapman University, the global human rights advocate has been sharing her experience with Chapman students across the university. This spring, Martinelli and 18 classmates got to engage even more profoundly with Murad in the course \u201cUnsung Stories and New Expressions: Making Conflict-Related Sexual Violence Visible.\u201d\nAs the students explored the work of Nadia\u2019s Initiative, which assists survivors and lifts communities out of crisis, they also broke into small groups to create four documentaries that support the initiative and the international cause of eliminating conflict-based sexual violence.\nBut those short films are just one example of the course\u2019s lasting impact, participants say. Over the semester, the students also learned:\n\nHow to turn immersive research and extensive preparation into intensely meaningful storytelling.\nHow the perspective of peace studies majors can enhance the work of documentarians, and vice versa.\nHow following the Murad Code of ethical interviewing and conduct can illuminate experience without evoking previously documented trauma.\nHow survivors of sexual violence have much more to offer the world than just retelling stories of the horrors they endured.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chance to consider why we have tended to focus on the violence instead of on the work Nadia is doing to support her community and other women,\u201d said Lisa Leitz, associate professor and Delp-Wilkinson Endowed Chair in Peace Studies. Leitz co-taught the course with Christine Fugate, assistant professor of film and an award-winning documentarian.\nStudents focusing on Murad\u2019s story learned about informed consent and ethical interviewing.\n\u201cThe violence is one piece of Nadia\u2019s life; it\u2019s not her whole life,\u201d Leitz added. \u201cOur students have been able to see how [not understanding that distinction] does a disservice and to apply what they\u2019ve learned.\u201d\n\u201cCombining the social sciences with issues like informed consent and how you portray a subject is so important,\u201d Fugate noted. \u201cReally the only way you can understand it all is through experience.\u201d\nOne documentary team had a particularly immersive experience, shadowing Murad throughout a week at Chapman. The students went backstage as Murad prepared for a discussion with President Daniele C. Struppa at Musco Center for the Arts; they recorded her interactions with students during classes; and they joined her at home as her husband, Abid Shamdeen, whipped up a traditional Yazidi brunch.\n\u201cWe learned that she still has dreams she\u2019s had all her life,\u201d said Ruthie Weeks \u201925, a broadcast journalism and documentary major. \u201cShe loves doing hair and makeup and spending time with friends, just as she\u2019s passionate about her advocacy.\u201d\n\u201cWe wanted to help her create something authentic to her,\u201d added peace studies major Emma Drake \u201923. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to portray her as a victim who doesn\u2019t have power, because she does, and that\u2019s what matters. Then other people can feel empowered to spread that message.\u201d\nAmong those people are 19 Chapman film and peace studies students who, during a semester of intense study and collaboration, got to know Nadia Murad better than they ever could have imagined.\nInstead of the heroic character they\u2019d read about in some media portrayals, the students met a real person, which makes Murad\u2019s impact all the more tangible, perhaps even attainable, said Blair Henry \u201926.\n\u201cI feel like we have a lot in common,\u201d Henry said as the team\u2019s week with Murad concluded. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss her.\u201d\n\n\ndocumentary filmmaking Lisa Leitz Nadia Murad peace studies Presidential Fellow Wilkinson College of Arts Humanities and Social Sciences \n\n\n\n\n \n\nDennis Arp \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandi Simon Center for Dance Ushers in New Era for Dance at Chapman\n\n\n\n\n\nAngela Bassett to Speak at 2023 Chapman University Commencement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Asia-Pacific Initiative Offers Unique Take on Hotbed Region Growing up in Los Angeles, Robert Koepp became fascinated with Asia.
