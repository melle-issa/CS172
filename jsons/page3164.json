Known for its ideal climate with daytime temperatures rarely below 60\u00b0F or above 80\u00b0F degrees (in other words, it's always flip-flop weather), San Diego has miles of sandy beaches, and a variety of things to see and do. SDSU's campus is within a 15-minute drive of downtown San Diego, the Pacific Ocean, and the mountains.\n\nIn the heart of San Diego.How Close?10 miles \u2192 Beaches10 miles \u2192 Downtown50 miles \u2192 Mountains75 miles \u2192 Deserts95 miles \u2192 Disneyland120 miles \u2192 Los Angeles350 miles \u2192 Phoenix500 miles \u2192 San FranciscoLiving in San DiegoSan Diego's geographic location and diverse regional population create plenty of opportunities for work, play and learning. From the hustle and bustle of the Gaslamp Quarter downtown to the charming and eclectic beach towns of Pacific Beach, Ocean Beach, and La Jolla, San Diego offers a wide variety of social and cultural activities. There aren't many places where you can watch the sun rise in the desert, build a snowman in the mountains in the afternoon, and watch the sun set into the ocean all in one day, but this is possible in San Diego.Explore Beaches and BaysWhether you want to go surfing, take a bike ride, explore tide pools, or spend a day in the sun, our beaches and bays have something for you. You can even earn SDSU credit in water sports like kayaking, sailing, stand up paddling, surfing, wakeboarding, and windsurfing by taking classes at the Mission Bay Aquatic Center!Grab your towel and take a break in the sun at San Diego's beaches and bays.Set Foot on AdventureYour adventure awaits! Hike sandstone bluffs overlooking the ocean in Torrey Pines or head inland closer to SDSU, and you can climb peaks to take in breathtaking panoramic views of landmarks over 100 miles away. Challenge your physical and mental limits with classes and outdoor excursions through Aztec Adventures.Discover San Diego's hiking trails.Arts AliveSan Diego Arts & CultureCelebrate the ArtsThe arts are alive in San Diego and at SDSU.\n\nSan Diego is home to two Tony\u2122 Award-winning theaters, historic sites, art, music venues, dance performances, film festivals, galleries, and much more. In the heart of San Diego is Balboa Park, which hosts 17 museums and performing arts venues. And to top it off, SDSU hosts concerts for many well-known artists at our on-campus venues, Viejas Arena and the Cal Coast Credit Union Open Air Theatre, and hosts plays, musicals, films, music ensembles and dance in our multiple theatres.\n\nBe In the KnowPlay Like a LocalThis is the place to step out of your comfort zone, try something new, and perhaps discover a new hobby that you love. Whether it's taking in the arts, strolling one of the many outdoor shopping malls, driving up to Disneyland for a day trip, or soaking in the rays at the beach, there is plenty to do. So c'mon, what are you waiting for?Live it up and explore the top things to do in San Diego.Eat Like a LocalDue to the city's long history and close proximity to Mexico, there is an extensive variety of authentic Mexican restaurants to choose from, and given that our region is surrounded by farms and ocean, fresh local ingredients and farm-to-table roots create an excellent California cuisine. It's no wonder that San Diego was ranked No. 5 on Yelp's U.S. Destination for Food Lovers.Getting hungry? The San Diego food scene is waiting for you.Career Services, Job ResourcesLeave Your Mark on the IndustrySDSU prepares you for life after graduation.\n\nOur region is an industry leader in biotechnology, engineering, cybersecurity, innovation and technology, healthcare, travel and tourism and the blue economy. With its proximity to the eastern edge of the Pacific Rim, Mexico, and South America, San Diego is a cultural center that provides opportunities for learning experiences. Through internships, mentorships, and job placements, San Diego State University provides students with opportunities to work in these industries. This experience will prepare you for life after you graduate and begin your career, or take the next step in your educational journey.\n\nVisit SDSUWe offer a variety of in-person and virtual events for prospective and admitted students and their families.Tours & Virtual VisitsVirtual Preview DayExplore SDSU Admitted Student DayOut-of-State Events\nWelcome to SDSU\nContact AdmissionsVisitRequest Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyoutube\ntwitter\nfacebook\ninstagram\n\n\n\n\n619-594-5200\n               \t\t\t\t\t\t\t5500 Campanile Drive\n               \t\t\t\t\t\t\tSan Diego, CA 92182\n\nMaps\nParking\n\n\n\n\nCampus Directory\nEmployment\nMedia Relations\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Contact\nNetwork Status\nStrategic Plan\nNewsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nDocument Readers\nDigital Privacy Statement\nCampus Safety Reports\nFeedback\n\n\u00a9 2023 San Diego State UniversityAll Rights ReservedLast Updated\nback to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Updated 1/19/23",
