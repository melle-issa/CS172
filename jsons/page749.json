Looks like this is coming from the block editor. I placed quotes around the current links and what my suggestion would be for new links.\nReady to get started? Contribute as an \"individual\" or as an \"organization\".\nReady to get started?\n\"Contribute as an individual\"\n\"Contribute as an organization\"\nMakes more sense to arrange these as a list (ul) maybe?\nI am an individual interested in participating in WordPress\n\"Get Involved\"\nI am part of an organization interested in participating in WordPress\n\"Get Started\"\nI think these links can go away and the sentence can become the link?\n\nThere was concern about these links being too ugly but I do not think Gutenberg supports aria-label at this point. Could use some design feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStevenDufresne\n\n\n\n\n        added\n  the \n\n  [Status] Needs Design\n\n label\n\n\n    Apr 19, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for free\nto join this conversation on GitHub.\n    Already have an account?\n    Sign in to comment\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    Assignees\n  \n\n    No one assigned\n\n\n\n\n    Labels\n  \n\n\n[Status] Needs Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Projects\n  \n\n\n\n    None yet\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    Milestone\n  \n\n      No milestone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Development\n  \nNo branches or pull requests\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      2 participants\n    \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n        \u00a9 2023 GitHub, Inc.\n        \n\n\n\nFooter navigation\n\nTerms\nPrivacy\nSecurity\nStatus\nDocs\nContact GitHub\nPricing\nAPI\nTraining\nBlog\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    You can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n  \n\n\n\n\nYou signed in with another tab or window.
