These\u00a0celebrations are meant to\u00a0complement and not replace the university\u2019s commencement\u00a0ceremonies.\nCultural Graduation\u00a0Celebrations provide students\u00a0the opportunity to publicly thank the people who helped them on their journey. They also honor the importance of overcoming systemic barriers within higher education and affirm the different paths that lead to academic success. Cultural Graduation Celebrations will be live-streamed except for the Native American/Indigenous Graduation\u00a0because it will be\u00a0outside.\nIf you\u00a0have any questions regarding\u00a0Cultural Graduation\u00a0Celebrations contact\u00a0thehub@sonoma.edu.\n\n\n\n\nAsian/Pacific Islander (API), Middle Eastern (ME) Graduation\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWednesday, May 17, 2023\u00a0\u00a0| 2:00pm - 3:30pm | Ballrooms B, C, D\nAsian/Pacific Islander (API) and Middle Eastern (ME) Graduation\u00a0is an annual celebration to commemorate the graduation success and achievements of API/ME\u00a0identified graduating students along with honoring staff, and faculty that have contributed work, community, and service to the Asian/American Desi American Pacific Islander* and Middle Eastern communities at SSU. \u200b\n*This is an acknowledgement that the API name is very limited to the breadth of the unique and vast ethnicities and cultures of the Asian countries and Diaspora, which includes but not limited to: Pacific Islander, South Asian, Southeast Asian, Desi, Desi American, Southwest Asian, Asian, Asian American, Multiracial, Multiethnic, Multinational, Transnational Adoptees, and more.\n\n\nRainbow Graduation\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThursday, May 18, 2023 | 12:00pm - 1:30pm | Ballrooms B, C, D\u00a0\nRainbow Graduation\u00a0honors the achievements of SSU\u2019s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA+) graduating students.

We honor the contributions that NAI students, staff, faculty, and the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria are making to our growing community at Sonoma State University.\u00a0The\u00a0celebration\u00a0also pays tribute to\u00a0graduating students' families and the tribal communities\u00a0who\u00a0have contributed to their\u00a0success.\u00a0\n*We welcome\u00a0all students who identify as Native American,\u00a0American Indian,\u00a0and/or\u00a0Indigenous, including and not limited to Alaska Native, Indigenous Hawaiian, and Indigenous Latinx.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Graduation\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday, May 19, 2023\u00a0| 4:00pm\u00a0- 5:30pm | Person Theatre\u00a0\nBlack Graduation\u00a0celebrates the brilliance and unapologetic\u00a0Blackness that is represented within SSU's Black student population.\u00a0We honor the accomplishments of graduating students who identify within the African Diaspora by highlighting the\u00a0common experience.
