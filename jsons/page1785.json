The number is a significant increase over Chapman\u2019s overall undergraduate population, of which 17.6% are first-gen. This increase reflects the university\u2019s ongoing commitment to reach underrepresented students and provide increased opportunities for financial support.\u00a0\nEighty-four percent of the new undergraduate students will benefit from financial aid, with an average scholarship award of $31,605 and a total of $65 million in financial aid offered to incoming students. Chapman continues to increase financial aid to qualified students across the board. Last year, the total undergraduate financial aid offered was $177 million (including incoming and current students), a number that was up from $167 million the year before \u2013 making college more affordable and allowing the university to build a more diverse campus population.\u00a0\nMore Students Choose Chapman\nWhile total applications were down this year (14,403 vs.15,096 for fall 2021), it was still the second-highest in Chapman\u2019s history. In addition, this year\u2019s yield rate \u2013 the percentage of admitted students who committed to come to Chapman \u2013 increased by 16%.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing some of the university\u2019s long-term efforts toward access and inclusion pay off. Our financial aid and a holistic approach to our process are key to that success. We are learning how to balance both virtual and in-person offerings, extending our reach across the globe and to more remote places,\u201d says Marcela Mejia-Martinez, assistant vice president of admission.\u00a0\n\u201cMost importantly, we were able to welcome interested students and families back to campus to experience our culture and vibrant community. Those in-person experiences, interacting with our community, really helped students see themselves here and helped us yield the largest class in Chapman\u2019s history,\u201d she says.\u00a0\nThe Dale E. and Sarah Ann Fowler School of Engineering, which opened its doors in 2020, also continues to see substantial growth. Applications were up more than 10% from 2021, and the school will welcome over 150 undergraduate engineering students (including first-year and transfer students) with this fall class.\u00a0\nOther notable details about the incoming Class of 2026:\n\n46.3% identify as people of color.\nAverage GPA is 3.77.\nIncoming students come from 44 states and 36 countries.\n\n\n\nAdmission Chapman Now Class of 2026 orientation \n\n\n\n\n \n\nStaci Dumoski \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman VP Recognized by Local, National Industry Groups\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman CIO Named Tech Award Finalist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership That Spans the Campus Jack of all trades Kyle Tanimura is leaving quite the lasting mark on Chapman, where he has taken on multiple leadership roles as a double major in political science and strategic and corporate communication, with a...\n\n\nMay 1, 2023 Jennifer Winfield\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Pacific Islander Desi American Heritage Month Events at Chapman University Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Heritage Month, which runs from May 1 to 31, celebrates the identities, histories and experiences of the APIDA community.
