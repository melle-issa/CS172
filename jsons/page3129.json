She has published multiple short stories, as well as two books\u2013the 2017 Indies Book of the Year Show Her a Flower, a Bird, a Shadow, and her most recent book A Girl Goes into the Forest, which has been referred to as \u201csharp and disturbing\u201d (Publishers Weekly) and \u201cdexterous in anatomizing the relationships between mothers and daughters, emulating Henry James-like restraint to articulate that which is left unsaid between them\u201d (San Francisco Chronicle).\nIn an interview with Litstack, Pursell who founded Why There Are Words (WTAW) Press spoke of her hopes for publishing, \u201cI want to publish books that are unforgettable. Books that challenge, that evoke and provoke, that immerse readers. Books that confront issues, and by that I don\u2019t mean books that must shock or that are in-one\u2019s-face, necessarily. I value nuance and subtlety and beauty. Essentially, I want to publish books that endure.\u201d Peg Alford Pursell is dedicated to fostering creative voices, supporting and helping to create a better and thriving literary community. She recognizes that in order to produce and publish works that endure the method is \u201cquite simply, to publish the best books we can find.\u201d Their publication embraces all voices regardless of cultural or socio-economic background.\u00a0\nHer most recent book A Girl Goes into the Forest (Dzanc Books) is a collection of 78 individual short stories, most of which are but a couple of pages long. Yet, all of which showcase her incredible ability to create atmosphere, and to carve out intimate and sophisticated relationships. In truth, in just the first pages of her book, I was savoring every word of her prose and jealous of the talent she was able to display within merely one paragraph. And it is in my own humble opinion that her stories are universal and will endure the test of time.\nIn the story \u201cOld Church by the Sea\u201d the story begins with a mother and her teenage daughter visiting an abandoned church by the sea, and slowly and subtly blossoms into a short but poignant meditation on the relationship between the mother and daughter from the very beginning: \u201cHaving and wanting at the same time\u2014that\u2019s what it was to carry my daughter inside me. After, I was emptier than I could ever have imagined, I thought then.\u201d Her prose is direct, effective, and leaves just enough unsaid to inspire the minds of the reader to contemplate emotions that are curious but also utterly familiar.\u00a0\nPlease join us for a thought-provoking evening with Peg Alford Pursell on Wednesday, October 30th at 7:30 pm in Colusa Hall Room 100B. Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, Writer\u2019s Voice readings are free and open to the public.\nAuthor Website: https://www.pegalfordpursell.com/\nWTAW Press: https://www.wtawpress.org/\nSample Work: https://themuseumofamericana.net/a-man-with-horses-flash-fiction-by-peg-alford-pursell/\nWritten by Nicholas Shi\n\n\n \nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\nRelated\n \n\nOctober 29, 2019watershedcsuc \n\n\nPost navigation\n\u2190 WR Intern Spotlight: The Eternal\u00a0Question With Great Design Comes Immense\u00a0Power \u2192\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n\nEnter your comment here...\n\n\n\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nEmail (required) (Address never made public)\n\n\n\nName (required)\n\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t(\u00a0Log\u00a0Out\u00a0/\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tChange\u00a0)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Facebook account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t(\u00a0Log\u00a0Out\u00a0/\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tChange\u00a0)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\nConnecting to %s\n\n\n\n\n Notify me of new comments via email.
