This Notice describes how this information is collected, processed, maintained, protected, and disclosed. Unless otherwise indicated on a specific Site, the California State University is the data controller for all information collected under this Notice. Contact information for the CSU is listed at the end of this Notice.\nThis Notice does not apply to information collected from or about current or former employees, contractors, volunteers, and other workers at SDSU as part of their employment or working relationship with SDSU.\nExcept as specifically described, our Sites are operated in accordance with the laws of the United States. Please read this Notice carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. This Notice reflects the University\u2019s current practices and may change from time to time, so please check the Notice periodically for updates.\nPersonal Information we collect and process\nIn this Notice, \u201cpersonal information\u201d means any information that identifies or describes an individual user of the Sites, including, but not limited to, the user\u2019s name, social security number, physical description, address, telephone number, education, financial matters, medical or employment history, password, email address, and information that reveals any network location or identity. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), \u201cpersonal information\u201d includes all personal data as defined under EEA laws (including \u201csensitive personal information\u201d which is provided enhanced protections under those laws).\nWe collect personal information about users only as allowed by law and limit the collection of personal information to what is relevant and necessary to accomplish a lawful purpose of the University. We collect personal information (and sensitive personal information) that you send to the CSU, or permit us to obtain from third parties, for purposes relevant to CSU operations in pursuit of our academic mission. Examples include information needed for student admission (including financial aid information), employment, housing and dining services, online educational programs, research, health services, donor relations, visa application processing, event registration, parking services, IT usage and support services, library usage, bookstore operations, and website account registrations. Our legal basis for processing most of this information is to perform a task in the public interest or in fulfillment of CSU official functions, including those set out in the California Education Code and/or Title V of the California Code of Regulations, or under applicable federal law. Other legal bases for processing information include processing necessary for contract (e.g., to process parking permit payments), for legitimate interests (e.g., to send requested information) or consent (e.g., to process certain sensitive personal information).\nUser-Provided Information\nYou may be required to provide personal information to access or use certain parts of our Sites, or features of our Sites or services, including without limitation, when you apply for or enroll at one of our campuses or programs, subscribe to a newsletter or email list, make a purchase or donation, fill out a form, participate in any of our programs, special events or promotions, contact us with a comment, question or complaint, etc. If you do not provide the requested personal information, you may not be able to access or use the features of our Sites or service where such information is requested.\nDepending upon the nature of the transaction, the personal information that you may provide may include: contact information (name, home or mailing address, telephone number, social media username/handle, mobile phone and/or email address, etc.); academic area or interest; financial information (financial aid application history, payment history, social security number, passport number, credit card number, donation attribution and amount, etc.); health record information (medical record number), allergies, past medical history, family history, current medications, current medical conditions) demographic information (age, birthdate, marital status, income, etc.); and profile information (admissions date, graduation date, alumni status, student identification number, username, password, relationship to the University, etc.).\nEmails and Social Media Sites: If you correspond with us by email, mail or via social media, we may retain the content of your communication or social media posting, the email or social media account address from which it is sent, and our response. We collect information automatically using technology when you visit our Sites or social media pages or when you open one of our emails as described in this Notice.\nThe specific personal information (and sensitive personal information) we collect, why we collect it, and our legal basis for processing it, is periodically reassessed in applicable data process flow assessments or Data Protection Impact Assessments, as relevant.\nIt is the policy of the California State University to limit the collection and safeguard the privacy of personal information collected or maintained by the University. The University\u2019s information management practices conform to the requirements of the Information Practices Act of 1977 (Civil Code Section 1798, et seq.), the Public Records Act (California Government Code Section 6250, et seq.), California Government Code Section 11015.5, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99), and other applicable laws pertaining to information privacy. In the event of a conflict between this Notice and the Public Records Act, the Information Practices Act, FERPA, or other law governing the disclosure of University records, the applicable law will control.\nAny information acquired by the University through the Sites is subject to the limitations set forth in the Information Practices Act. The University will not distribute or share electronically collected personal information (as defined in subdivision (d) of California Government Code Section 11015.5) about users to any third party without the permission of the user, except in narrow circumstances set forth in this Notice. The University will not sell any electronically collected personal information to any third party. Such electronically-collected personal information is exempt from requests made pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1).\nHow we use the information we collect\nWe use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information:\n\nTo provide you with information that you request from us.\nTo process application, registration and enrollment requests when you apply, register or enroll at any of our campuses, events, programs or services, or otherwise to administer your participation in our events, programs or services, including (without limitation) study abroad and distance learning, financial aid, housing and dining.\nTo collect and process donations, gifts and donor information.\nTo process service requests from students, staff, faculty, and other members of the campus community, including the facilitation of parking permit and identification card requests.\nTo process registration for sports, cultural, educational, and other university events.\nTo respond to your questions, requests, comments or complaints and determine your satisfaction with our events, programs and services.\nTo operate, maintain, and provide to you the features, services, and functionality of the Sites and its contents, and to monitor and improve our site and the user experience.\nTo provide information about our University and send you related information including brochures and other University materials, campus and CSU news, academic notices, updates, security alerts, special offers, confirmations, and support and administrative messages.\nTo notify you about changes to our Sites or any services we offer or provide through it.\nTo compare and review your personal information for errors, omissions and accuracy.\nTo prevent, detect or investigate any fraudulent, abusive or illegal act.\nTo allow you to participate in interactive features on our Sites.\nIn any other way we may describe when you provide the information.\nFor any other purpose with your consent.\nWe may also use your personal information for operational and other lawful purposes such as security, analytics, operations, fraud detection and prevention, reporting, making back-ups and legal compliance.\n\nWe use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Sites; (b) monitor the effectiveness of our Sites and services; (c) monitor aggregate metrics such as the total number of visitors and traffic; (d) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP; and (e) help you efficiently access information.\nAt the time we collect personal information, we strive to tell users about the purpose for which the information is collected as well as the general or specific uses that we will make of that information.\nInternational transfer of personal information\nPersonal information provided to us by users outside of the United States may be transferred to other countries such as the United States, where data protection laws may differ from those of your home country. By providing us with your information, you acknowledge that your personal information may be transferred to the United States and processed on servers within the United States. However, all reasonable steps will be taken to protect your privacy in accordance with applicable data protection laws.\nUser Content\nAny personal information or content you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Sites (for instance, any content you post) (\u201cUser Content\u201d) becomes available to the public via the Sites. User Content includes, but is not limited to, comments, photos, videos, etc. If you remove User Content, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your User Content.\nWe reserve the right to monitor the User Content you post on the Sites and to remove any User Content for any reason or no reason including, without limitation, if in our sole opinion, such material violates, or may violate, any applicable law, or to protect or defend our rights or those of any third party. We also reserve the right to remove User Content upon the request of any third party.\nCookie Policy\nCookies Information: When you visit the Sites, we may send one or more cookies \u2013 a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters \u2013 to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Sites. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Sites. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser\u2019s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Sites or services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.\nGoogle Analytics\nWe use a tool called \u201cGoogle Analytics,\u201d a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. to collect information about use of the Sites. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit our Sites, what pages are visited, and what other sites were visited prior to coming to our Sites. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Sites.\u00a0\nGoogle Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Sites, rather than your name or other identifying information. Google Analytics will also collect contextual information, such as type of web browser, type of operating system, browser resolution, and network location, however we do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.\u00a0\nAlthough Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Sites, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google\u2019s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.\u00a0\nYou can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the Sites by disabling cookies on your browser, however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Sites.\nMicrosoft Clarity\nWe use a tool called Microsoft Clarity to gather information regarding our visitors to the Sites. Microsoft Clarity provides data to ensure our Sites are offering relevant content and indicates areas of the Sites for improvement.\nMicrosoft Clarity captures data from user sessions on our Sites and informs how the site renders and performs for our audiences, including clicks, scrolls, and other behaviors.\nThis data is anonymous and can not be related to a specific person. We do not gather personally-identifying information from visitors to our site using these technologies. We do not link or associate analytical data with a specific user or device\u2019s identification.\nLog File Information\nLog file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you register with or view our Sites, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol addresses or other device identifiers, browser information, Internet Service Provider, operating system, location, date/time stamp, clickstream data, referring/exit pages and URLs, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.\nClear Gifs Information\nWhen you use the Sites, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personal information is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.\nCalifornia Do Not Track Disclosures\nCalifornia Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d (DNT) browser settings. DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. We do not engage in the collection of personally identifiable information about users\u2019 online activities over time and across third party websites when an individual uses our Sites and therefore do not respond to DNT signals.\nHow we share your information\nWe share your information internally at the CSU to facilitate and manage the purposes listed above, including with third parties whom the University engages to process your personal information on our behalf for the purposes stated above (such as vendors who help the University with our marketing, application processing, financial aid or payment processing, education management, and web hosting). The University may also share your personal data with government and law enforcement agencies or regulators (1) to comply with a legal process, subpoena, order or other legal or regulatory requirement applicable to us; (2) to enforce our terms of use or other policies; or (3) to pursue available legal remedies or defend against legal claims. We may also share your personal information with a third party as requested by you if permitted by this and other University policies and applicable laws and regulations. We will not distribute or share any electronically collected personal information (as defined in subdivision (d) of California Government Code section 11015.5) about users to any third party without prior written permission from the user except in narrow circumstances involving possible violations of Section 502 of the Penal Code or as authorized under law (including but not limited to the Information Practices Act), or to assist another state agency or public law enforcement organization in any case where the security of a network operated by a state agency has been, or is suspected of having been, breached.\nWe fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our Sites or services for illegal activities. We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. Release of your personal information for security purposes, as described in this Notice to any person or entity, including, without limitation, in connection with any government investigation or litigation, shall be based on a determination made solely by us, as permitted by law or, for those not in the EEA, exercising our discretion for which you expressly grant permission to us in accordance with this Notice.\nHow we protect your information\nWe take reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information against loss, unauthorized access, and illegal use or disclosure. Such personal information is stored by the University in secure locations and University staff is trained on procedures for the management of personal information, including limitations on the release of information. Access to personal information is limited to those members of the University\u2019s staff whose work requires such access. Confidential information is destroyed according to the University\u2019s records retention schedule. The University conducts periodic reviews to ensure that proper information management policies and procedures are understood and followed.\nThe security of your personal information is important to us, but please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to the Sites, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. While we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online.\nWe encourage all individuals to use appropriate safeguards to secure their computers and the information on those computers. For additional information on online privacy and security, please see the University\u2019s policies and procedures related to Information Security; you may also consult with the California Attorney General\u2019s Privacy Enforcement and Protection website.\nIn the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly investigate and notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in the CSU Information Security Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.\nLinks to Other Websites\nWe are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Sites nor the information or content contained in them, and we make no warranty, either express or implied, concerning the content of any such site, including the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or suitability of them for any particular purpose, nor do we warrant that any such site or content is free from any claims of copyright, trademark, or other infringement of the rights of third parties, or that any such site or content is devoid of viruses or other contamination. We may provide links to other websites to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of linked sites does not imply endorsement by the University or CSU of any of the linked sites. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Sites to another website, our Notice is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our Sites, is subject to that website\u2019s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding. We do not ensure the security of your personal information if you visit websites not belonging to CSU, nor are we the data controller for any information collected on those sites unless we specifically state so. We further reserve the right to terminate a link to a third party site at any time.\nAccess and choice\nWe comply with all applicable regulations regarding data retention and deletion of personal data and retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected (including for college operations), for strategic planning, and to comply with applicable laws and retention requirements.\u00a0\nYou have the option to decline providing information about yourself online and may use other methods, such as U.S. mail, to respond to requests for information or to communicate with us. You may use the contact information listed below to ask about additional alternatives to providing or obtaining information through use of our Sites.\nBy providing us your email address, you consent to our use of your email address to send you Site and service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, including, but not limited to, newsletters, information on campus activities, programs and events, legal updates, changes to features of our Sites or services, or other account information. Where required by law, we will obtain your consent before sending you specific types of email or other communications.\nYou can choose not to receive such emails from us by \u201cunsubscribing\u201d using the instructions in any email you receive from us, or by sending a written request to the postal or email address set out below. It may take up to thirty (30) business days for us to process your request. This will not stop us from sending emails about your account or your transactions with us, or any other service-related email. Opting out does not affect our communications with you via telephone or mail nor does it affect our use of your non-personally identifiable information as described in this Notice.\nSDSU Email Policy\nEmail is one of the official methods of communication with faculty, staff and students at San Diego State University. Current San Diego State University employees, students and individuals utilizing an official SDSU email address are unable to opt out from receiving official university communication deemed essential.\u00a0\nChanges to Our Privacy Notice\nWe reserve the right to modify this Notice at any time. It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for other operational purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our Sites page, as determined by the University in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Notice. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address for you, and for periodically visiting our Sites and this Notice to check for any changes.\nFor changes to our Privacy Notice, it is our policy to post any changes we make on this page. The date the Notice was last revised is identified at the top of the page. We will provide notice on the Sites, or at website address, prior to the effective date of any change. Your continued use of the Sites after any change in this Notice will constitute your acceptance of such change.\nContact Us\nIf you have any questions about this Notice or the practices of our Sites, you may contact us by writing [email\u00a0protected]\n\n\nWelcome to SDSU\nApplyVisitGet Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyoutube\ntwitter\nfacebook\ninstagram\n\n\n\n\n619-594-5200\n               \t\t\t\t\t\t\t5500 Campanile Drive\n               \t\t\t\t\t\t\tSan Diego, CA 92182\n\nMaps\nParking\n\n\n\n\nCampus Directory\nEmployment\nMedia Relations\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Contact\nNetwork Status\nStrategic Plan\nNewsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nDocument Readers\nDigital Privacy Statement\nCampus Safety Reports\nFeedback\n\n\u00a9 2023 San Diego State UniversityAll Rights ReservedLast Updated\nback to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Updated 9/2/22",
