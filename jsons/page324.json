Exposure to a broad range of perspectives, views and outlooks is key to fostering both breadth and depth in intellectual discovery and furthering research.\nThe School of Engineering seeks to promote diversity, inclusion and fair treatment of all members of the community.\nIn a time when the importance of geographic boundaries has been virtually eliminated by emerging technology, the importance of diversity and the understanding of different perspectives play a key role in the functioning of our society.\nBrown University is founded on the ideals of academic inclusiveness and the benefits of a liberal education. These principles are held strongly at the School of Engineering, where this philosophy has developed into a culture of multidisciplinarity that crosses many intellectual boundaries. The School of Engineering's success through creative and collaborative approaches are a testament to the benefits of inclusion and working with a variety of diverse perspectives.Diversity is therefore a foundational element, which facilitates our educational and research goals, and the School is keenly aware of how enhancing historically under-represented populations in our engineering community furthers achievement of these goals.\nWe acknowledge the challenges and the opportunities of achieving diversity, particularly in the fields of engineering, which is why the School is strongly committed to developing these efforts at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.\nOutreach to under-represented populations for admissions, as well as efforts to engage students through student organizations and support/retention programs are a priority for the School.\nMany new initiatives are planned in these areas for the near future, and those with new ideas or support for our efforts should contact\u00a0Associate Dean Jennifer Casasanto for further discussion and brainstorming. \u00a0\nDiversity and Inclusion Action Plan\nAfter a thoughtful and wide-ranging dialog with our community during the spring of 2016, the School of Engineering has crafted a\u00a0Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan. This represents the beginning of a process, and we expect that it will be constantly updated, assessed, and refined in the years ahead.\nStaff Diversity and Inclusion Statement\nThe staff of the School of Engineering believes that we are enhanced by, and achieve success through, the teamwork and contributions of diverse community members\u2019 ideas, life experiences, perspectives and cultures. We are committed to the values of equity and inclusion for their academic, social, and broader community benefits.\nEach of us is dedicated to learning and actively engaging in our own development to support the changing needs of our community. The staff demonstrates this by consciously reflecting on their learning and development to better advocate for our constituencies. We actively embrace the differences that enrich our community and make us great.\nOur beliefs and actions promote and foster the School\u2019s culture of inclusivity, compassion, and mutual respect. Our open and welcoming environment makes our School a stronger organization.\nAffirmative Action Representatives\nThe affirmative action representatives are members of the faculty and are part of every search committee. They are expected to take a leading role in identifying women and minorities who qualify for the position, and in ensuring compliance with all affirmative action guidelines in all phases of the search. The affirmative action representatives assist the search committee in carrying out its responsibilities to develop a broad and diverse candidate pool and acts as a liaison to the EEO/AA Office during the process.\nPresidential Diversity Postdoctoral Fellowships\nThis program identifies promising Ph.D. graduates from underrepresented groups and/or those who have demonstrated support for underrepresented groups through their teaching and research to spend up to two years at Brown University. More information on how to apply and previous cohorts can be found through the Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity.\nResources\nFor more information, please contact the\u00a0Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Student Body Demographics\n\n  The most recent statistics are included (as of fall 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          453\n        \nUndergraduate Students\n\n\n\n\n          39%\n        \nWomen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          21%\n        \nURM\n\n\n\n\n          12%\n        \nInternational\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduate Students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          309\n        \nGraduate Students\n\n\n\n\n          43%\n        \nWomen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          6%\n        \nURM\n\n\n\n\n          59%\n        \nInternational\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvidence\nRI\n02912\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n401-863-1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Navigation\n\n\n\n\nVisit Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Navigation\n\n\n\n\nReservations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareers at Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe campaign for building on distinction\n\nGive To Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlickr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Brown University \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool of Engineering Brown University \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFor You\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProspective Students\n\n\nCurrent Students\n\n\nFaculty & Staff\n\n\nAlumni\n\n\nParents & Families\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Site Navigation\n\n\n\n\nMobile Site Navigation\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABET Accreditation\n\n\n\n\nAdmissions\n\n\n\n\nConcentrations\n\n\n\n\nContacts and Resources\n\n\n\n\nCourses\n\n\n\n\nInternships, Jobs, and Grad School\n\n\n\n\nNew Student Information\n\n\n\n\nStudent Organizations\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Awards\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmissions\n\n\n\n\nCourses\n\n\n\n\nPrograms and Deadlines\n\n\n\n\nPrograms Guide\n\n\n\n\nGraduate Student Organizations\n\n\n\n\nStudent Awards\n\n\n\n\nTravel Fund\n\n\n\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty\n\n\n\n\nStaff\n\n\n\n\nAdvisory Boards\n\n\n\n\nGraduate Students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCenters and Institutes\n\n\n\n\nCore Facilities\n\n\n\n\nHibbitt Fellows\n\n\n\n\nHope Street Fellows\n\n\n\n\nIndustry Engagement\n\n\n\n\nLaboratories\n\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni and Friends - Ways to Connect\n\n\n\n\nCommunications & Creative Resources\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\nEmployment\n\n\n\n\nMake a Gift\n\n\n\n\nProspective Employers\n\n\n\n\nVisit Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Secondary Navigation Navigation\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\nFor You\n\n\n\n\nGive Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Site Only\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of Brown.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen details for Diversity and Inclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookmark this Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
