This post is the first in a series of five posts in which we\u2019ll outline the new direction we plan to take regarding plugin maintenance and evolutions. After some introductory words, we\u2018ll focus on the new BuddyPress purpose that I believe we should adopt for years to come.\nWe haven\u2018t forgotten that, at the end of 2021, we had some conversations (here & here) about this \u00ab difficult to answer with a few words \u00bb question. These happened once the plugin\u2019s active installs statistics went a bit under 200.000. Our WordPress plugin directory page\u2019s \u201cactive installations\u201d value suddenly changed from \u201c200,000+\u201d to \u201c100,000+\u201d\u2014though the actual number only changed from just over 200.000 to about 190.000 active installation\u2013making this decline seem pretty spectacular \ud83d\udcc9. It was nevertheless a great opportunity to think together about how the plugin should evolve now that 15 years have passed since its birth.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let me offer some thanks on behalf of the BuddyPress development team:\n\nThanks a lot to the women & men who are trusting the plugin to power their community WordPress sites \ud83d\ude0d\nThanks a million to the contributors who share some of their free time, energy or resources with us to maintain the plugin \ud83e\udd1d\nWarm gratitude to Automattic for providing BuddyPress\u2019s web site, our dev\u2019updates blog as well as our Trac environment, these tools are essential to BuddyPress & its community \ud83e\udef6\nFinally huge thanks to everyone of us, members of the team; for 15 years we\u2019ve been working together to maintain & improve this free and open-source plugin \ud83d\udcaa\n\n\nYour feedback: the main points\nI believe we can organize your ideas in 5 categories:\n\nWhat should be our main purpose(s)?\nHow should the plugin be organized?\nWhat features should BuddyPress include?\nWhat improvements does the plugin UI need?\nHow can we attract and keep new contributors?\n\nAs introduced earlier into this post, let\u2018s wrap up your feedback about the first topic and explain how they contributed to what I think should be our new main purpose.\n\nKey feedback about BuddyPress\u2019s purpose\n\n\u00ab Communities organized around a product \u00bb\n\u00ab It is the perfect choice for company intranets \u00bb\n\u00ab Private, secure social network just for your friends/family \u00bb\n\u00ab Sites for educational courses, coaching \u00bb\n\u00a0\u00ab It would have been the collaboration platform of choice over the pandemic had the privacy and security been there \u00bb\n\u00ab Needs a more specific mission and purpose: BuddyVerse \u00bb\n\u00ab Too Developer-focused \u00bb\n\nAs a reminder, here\u2019s our site\u2019s tagline about BuddyPress\u2019s purpose: \u00ab Fun & flexible software for online communities, teams, and groups. BuddyPress helps you build any kind of community website using WordPress, with member profiles, activity streams, user groups, messaging, and more. \u00bb\nLet\u2019s start with the last point as it contains negative implications: \u00ab too developer-focused \u00bb \u2699\ufe0f. \nYes, we have third party plugins or themes in mind at some point during our coding process: our main concern about these is potential compatibility issues. That\u2019s why when we have a doubt, we put backward compatibility code into the plugin. It\u2019s also true we used to primarily think about BuddyPress as a plugin you can build great things on top of it; that\u2019s reflected in the \u00ab helps you build \u00bb part of our tagline.\nThis model is interesting as long as third-party plugin authors are very involved with contributing to BuddyPress. However, they do not share their energy & time with us as often as was common in BuddyPress\u2019s early years.\nI believe we now need to satisfy end-users first \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83d\udc67\u200d\ud83d\udc66. A reproach I often read in reviews posted about the plugin on WordPress.org is: \u00ab BuddyPress is not including the basic features any end-user would expect so that it\u2019s needed to install other third party plugins \u00bb. And a majority of reviewers are then regularly complaining: \u00ab a lot of these plugins have not been updated for a while or worse are no longer maintained \u00bb. \u26a0\ufe0f The problem then is that using these plugins can increase WordPress sites security threats even if BuddyPress benefits from the WP hacker1 program. Being able to run a safe community is very important: we don\u2019t settle in a neighborhood when our security is at risk.\nPrivacy is a basic need we absolutely have to satisfy \ud83d\udd10. Yes, BuddyPress can be an interesting choice for company intranets, social stores, family circles or social learning platforms as soon as we can easily lock some areas of the community pages.\nAbout federating WordPress site owners updates into a BuddyVerse \ud83c\udf0d, it\u2019s an amazing idea I already heard of 5 years ago during the WordCamp Europe 2017. As WordPress is powering around 40% of Internet sites, I guess there\u2019s an interesting potential, but I believe we need a lot more contributors to master the ActivityPub protocol (extending the ActivityPub WordPress plugin?) or the Matrix standard and required developments to allow 2 or more WordPress instances to follow each others or more globally to achieve a distributed BuddyPress network. To avoid missing the \u00ab we figured out being chained into social media owned by capricious billionaires was masochistic \u00bb opportunity, maybe we can make a first step into this direction and reach something approaching improving how we deal with RSS feeds & implementing Webmentions.\nTo conclude this part of your feedbacks review, I think we need to work in directions so that you can use BuddyPress to:\u00a0\n\u00ab Get together safely, in your own way, in WordPress \u00bb.\nI think the \u00ab own \u00bb word is fundamental: compared to social media \ud83d\udcb8 where you lose ownership over your data, where this information is used to earn money off your content. With BuddyPress, you control every aspect of your community.\n\nThe first two concrete steps\nBuddyPress 12.0, our next major version, will introduce a huge, necessary improvement to make many other improvements possible. We are replacing our Legacy URL parser with a new BP Rewrites API (which is based on the WordPress Rewrite API). We are completely restructuring the way BuddyPress analyzes URLs to decide whether to load community content and what is being requested. The benefits for you:\n\nEvery BuddyPress URL will be customizable into your language (I heard it was important for SEO).\nBuddyPress will finally support plain permalinks.\nBP URL parsing will be more reliable & fully compliant with WordPress best practices.\n\nBecause this change is potentially a breaking one for plugins that won\u2018t be updated, we\u2018ll also build a BP Classic plugin, so you\u2018ll be able to continue enjoying these slow-to-update plugins.\nSecondly, 12.0 will also include a new community visibility feature giving you the ability to use BuddyPress to power your private communities.\nWe\u2018ll take more time than usual to reach this 12th milestone. We need to document the needed changes plugin authors will need to perform as well as inform our users what they should do if something goes wrong with the 12.0 upgrade process.\n12.0 final release is slated for October 30, and we welcome everyone wishing to get involved.\nHow should we organize the plugin? That\u2019s the second category of your feedback, and we\u2019ll talk about it in the next post of this series.\n\nProps: many thanks to @dcavins for his review \ud83e\udd70.\n\n\nOne Response to \u201cBuddyPress has a new purpose\u201d\n\n\n\n\n Earl_D says: \n\nMay 1, 2023 at 11:42 pm \nLook forward to hearing. After several attempts over many years I finally have Buddypress working on my niche community. So I hope the future will include space for implementations like my own.\nReply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply\nCancel Comment Reply\nName (required)\n\nMail (will not be published) (required)\n\nWebsite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0394 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nBuddyCamps\n\ncase study\n\nCommunity\n\nGuest Post\n\nHow To\n\nMeta\n\nNews\n\nScreencasts\n\nWordCamps\n\n\n\n\nTags\n1.1\n1.2\n1.5\n1.6\n1.7\n1.8\n1.9\n2.0\n2.1\n2.3.0\n2.4.0\n2.5.0\n2.6.0\n2.7.0\n2.8.0\n5.0.0\n6.0.0\n7.0.0\n8.0.0\n10.0.0\nbbpress\nbeta\nBeta2\nbeta 2\nBuddyCamp\nBuddyPress Template Pack\ncodex\nContributor Day\ncontributors\ndevelopers\nfeatures\nfuture\nmaintenance\nrc-1\nrelease candidate\nreleases\nrewrites\nroadmap\nsecurity\nsupport\nSurvey\nthemes\nupgrades\nuses\nwordcamp \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSee also:\t\t\t\t\tWordPress.org \u2022\n\t\t\t\t\tbbPress.org \u2022\n\t\t\t\t\tBuddyPress.org \u2022\n\t\t\t\t\tMatt \u2022\n\t\t\t\t\tBlog RSS\n\n\n\n\nFollow BuddyPress on Twitter \u2022\n\t\t\t\t\tGPL \u2022\n\t\t\t\t\tContact Us \u2022\n\t\t\t\t\tPrivacy \u2022\n\t\t\t\t\tTerms of Service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to toolbar\n\nWordPress.orgAbout WordPressDocumentationSupport ForumsFeedbackDeveloper TracDeveloper BlogbbPress.orgAbout bbPressDocumentationSupport ForumsFeedbackDeveloper TracDeveloper BlogBuddyPress.orgAbout BuddyPressDocumentationSupport ForumsFeedbackDeveloper TracDeveloper BlogBuddyPress.orgLog inAnonymousAnonymousNot Logged InRegisterLog In \n\n",
