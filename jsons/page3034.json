Resource Center (NRC)!\nHowka (Kumeyaay greeting),\nFounded in 1897 on Kumeyaay land, San Diego State University is gaining more recognition\n                                       as a leader in

They\n                                                are a people whose traditional lifeways intertwine with a worldview of earth and sky\n                                                in a community of living beings. This land is part of a relationship that has nourished,\n                                                healed, protected and embraced the Kumeyaay people to the present day.\u00a0 It is part\n                                                of a world view founded in the harmony of the cycles of the sky and balance in the\n                                                forces of life. For the Kumeyaay, red and black represent the balance of those forces\n                                                that provide for harmony within our bodies as well as the world around us.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs students, faculty, staff and alumni of San Diego State University we acknowledge\n                                                this legacy from the Kumeyaay. We promote this balance in life as we pursue our goals\n                                                of knowledge and understanding. We find inspiration in the Kumeyaay spirit to open\n                                                our minds and hearts. It is the legacy of the red and black. It is the land of the\n                                                Kumeyaay.\n\u00a0\nEyay e\u2019Hunn My heart is good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Native Education:\nGive to the NRC\nDonations collected with the link above go directly to supporting scholarships for\n                                    Native students at SDSU!\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n                                             Native Resource Center\n\n\n\nNative Resource Center\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSDSU RESOURCES\n\nAbout\nAcademic Calendars\nAcademics\nAdmissions\nCampus Calendar\nCampus Directory\nCampus Life\nEmergency Information\nGive to SDSU\nJobs at SDSU\nMaps and Directions\nNewsCenter\nParking & Transportation\nResearch\nTours\n\nSACD DEPARTMENTS\n\nCareer Services\nCommunication Services\nCounseling & Psychological Services\nEOP & Ethnic Affairs\nFinancial Aid & Scholarships\nNew Student & Parent Programs\nOffice of the Student Ombudsman\nResidential Education Office (Housing)\nStudent Ability Success Center\nStudent Health Services\nStudent Life & Leadership\nStudent Rights & Responsibilities\nTechnology Services\nTesting Services\nWell-being & Health Promotion\n\nCENTERS/PROGRAMS\n\nCenter for Educational Partnerships, Outreach and Success\nCenter for Inclusive Excellence\nCultural Centers\n\n-\u00a0Black Resource Center\n-\u00a0Native Resource Center\n-\u00a0The Pride Center\n-\u00a0Center for Intercultural relations\n-\u00a0Asian Pacific Islander Desi American Resource Center (APIDA)\n-\u00a0Latinx Resource Center\n-\u00a0Women's Resource Center\n-\u00a0Center for Transformative Justice\n\n\nEconomic Crisis Response Team (ECRT)\nEmployee Resource Groups\nInclusive SDSU\nMilitary and Veterans Programs\n\nMAIN AREAS\n\nAccess & Community Standards\nCampus & Community Partnerships\nCampus Life & Dean of Students\nCommunity & Belonging\nFaculty & Staff\nFinance & Operations\nHealth, Well-being & Accessibility\nStrategic Initiatives\n\n\n\nNEW STUDENTS\n\nAbout SDSU\nAdmissions\nFamily Weekend\nFirst-Year Students\nNew Student Orientation\nNew Student & Family Convocation\nTransfer Information\nWelcome Week\n\nSTUDENT RESOURCES\n\nCareers\nFinancial Aid & Scholarships\nGraduate Student Diversity\nHealth and Wellness\nHousing\nStudent who are Parents\n\nCAMPUS LIFE\n\nCampus Life\nCultural Centers\nInternational Students\nLeadership Opportunities\nStudent Organizations\n\nPARENT PROGRAMS\n\nAztec Parents Association\nAztec Parents Fund\nAztec Parents Program\nNew Student & Parent Programs\nNews for Aztec Parents\nParent Hotline\n\nRESOURCES FOR PARENTS\n\nCareer Services Resources for Parents\nFinancial Aid & Scholarships for Parents\nStudent Health Services for Parents\nUseful Tips for Parents\n\nEMPLOYERS & COMMUNITY PARTNERS\n\nCareer Fairs\nInformation for Employers\nOn-Campus Interviews\nSalary Survey Results\nWorkAbility IV\n\n\n\nCENTER FOR INCLUSIVE EXCELLENCE\n\nBuilding on Inclusive Excellence\nProfessors of Equity\nProfessional Development and Facilitation\nResearch & Scholarly Excellence\nResources\n\nEMPLOYEE GROUPS\n\nAbility/Disability ERG\nAsian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) ERG\nBAYANIHAN, Filipino American Faculty and Staff Association\nBlack Faculty Staff Association\nBlack Women in Academia (BWA)\nChristian Community ERG (CCERG)\nFirst-Gen Faculty & Staff Association\nIranian American Faculty Staff Association ERG\nLatina Network\nLatinX, ChicanX & Hispanic Faculty & Staff Association (LCHFSA)\nMen of Color Alliance ERG\nMilitary and Veterans Faculty and Staff Association (Mil-Vet)\nNative American and Indigenous Faculty and Staff Association\nPride ERG\nWomen in Business Academia (WBA)\n\nFACULTY/STAFF INITIATIVES\n\nDiversity Liaisons\nDiversity Planning\n\nDIVERSITY RESOURCES\n\nDiversity Statistics\nLand Acknowledgment\nResources in Response to Incidents of Racial Violence\n\nDIVERSITY INITIATIVES\n\nHispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) Affairs\nPledge Supporting SDSU\u2019s African American Community\nTribal Liaison\nStatements from the Chief Diversity Officer\nInclusive SDSU\n\nSUPPORT US\n\nSupport Student Affairs & Campus Diversity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nLuke Wood\nVice President, Student Affairs and Campus Diversity\n\nFacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDivision of Student Affairs & Campus Diversity\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5500 Campanile Drive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSan Diego, CA 92182-1620\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTelephone: 619-594-5200\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nA-Z Index\nCampus Directory\nMaps\nParking\n\n\n\n\nEmployment\nMedia Relations\nGive to SDSU\nmy.SDSU\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Contact\nNetwork Status\nStrategic Plan\nNewsletter Sign Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 San Diego State University\n\n\nAccessibility\nSDSU Digital Privacy Statement\nFeedback\nCampus Safety Plan\nAnnual Security Report\n\n\nLast Update: July 18, 2016\nDocument Readers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Updated 1/10/23",
