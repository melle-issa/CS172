(PDF)\u00a0\u00a0 Mission StatementThe\u00a0Gender & Sexuality Equity Coalition (GSEC)\u00a0is a student-run activist organization that strives to empower all students through its three programs: the Women\u2019s Program, the Queer Program, and the Trans Program. The GSEC challenges societal norms that have been used to oppress and marginalize, by providing opportunities for leadership, personal development, and referral services. We offer a safe and inclusive space where the campus and community can effectively support the academic mission of the university.\u00a0The\u00a0Women\u2019s Program\u00a0utilizes intersectional Feminist ideologies to offer educational opportunities and programs that are centered on diverse women\u2019s experiences. This program seeks to create and sustain a safe university environment that promotes the personal, educational, and professional growth of all women.\u00a0The\u00a0Queer Program\u00a0seeks to provide holistic LGBTQ+ education, to sustain a safe campus environment, and to cultivate community for all queer people affected by heterosexism (i.e. homophobia, bisexual erasure, etc.). This program is dedicated to promoting accessible, affirming, and empowering spaces for sexually and romantically diverse people of all intersecting identities.\u00a0The\u00a0Trans Program\u00a0aims to foster accessibility, community building, and empowerment for all trans and gender diverse people by challenging institutional and interpersonal oppression perpetuated by cissexism and transphobia. This program uses intersectional theory when providing support for people of all gender and sex identities.\u00a0The GSEC will continue to exist and advocate for social justice as long as the damaging ideologies of sexism, racism, heterosexism, cissexism, ableism, sizeism, xenophobia, and any other form of oppression exists.Programs and ServicesOur programming has gone fully online, please check out our social medias!The GSEC provides the following programs and services to assist in the advancement of our mission:3 unit InternshipsSpark e-Newsletter & ZineGSEC podcastFree and low cost menstrual and sexual health products.EventsGSEC\u00a0General Contact Info530-898-5724gsec.director@csuchico.eduInstagram: @chicostategsec_Facebook:\u00a0Chico State GSEC\n                        Meet the staff \n                    \n                    \t\t    \t\t\n    \t\t                2022-23 GSEC Staff\n    Alysa CringleGSEC\u00a0Program CoordinatorFeminist FridaysSarah BrunoGSEC Program CoordinatorWomen's ProgramAbraham TrujilloGSEC Program CoordinatorQueer and Trans*Abe Renteria (they/he)GSEC\u00a0Program Coordinatorgsec.coordinator2@csuchico.edu\n                        \t\t\n    \t\t                GSEC is partially funded by CSU Chico's Associated Students(opens in new window).\n    College of Behavioral & Social SciencesButte Hall, Room 701530-898-6171bss@csuchico.eduwww.csuchico.edu/bssSupport Our CollegeProgram PortfolioBSS Majors &\u00a0ProgramsAnthropologyChild DevelopmentEconomicsGeography & PlanningPublic Health & Health Services AdministrationMulticultural & Gender StudiesPolitical Science & Criminal JusticePsychologySocial ScienceSocial WorkSociology\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.Contact UsNeed Help?FacebookFacebookTwitterTwitterInstagramInstagramReport an accessibility issueReport a broken link on this pageTitle IXPrivacy PolicyCalifornia State University, Chico400 West First StreetChico, CA 95929Copyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n",
