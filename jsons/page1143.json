Stanford researchers are stretching the boundaries of current printing models and finding innovative ways to solve pressing dilemmas of design, engineering, and medicine. \n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\nBy Shannon Banks\n\nThe 3D printer has come a long way since the debut of consumer-friendly printers in the early 2000s. The versatile technology allows designers and engineers to forgo traditional manufacturing, opening up a world of seemingly endless possibilities. But the instrument has its limits. The process can be slow, and most objects can only be built layer by layer \u2013 with just one material at a time.\nStanford University researchers are challenging the limitations of current 3D printing technology. One innovative printing method is increasing printing speeds by 10x that of the quickest available model and allowing researchers to introduce multiple materials at once. Another group of engineers is using light to carve intricate designs into stationary mounds of resin, hoping to eliminate the need to build from the bottom up.\nFrom creating surprisingly strong nanoscale lattices built to protect fragile satellites to fashioning heart tissue from living cells to combat congenital heart disease, these researchers are exploring the what ifs of this technology. What if our products were more resilient? What if we used biomaterials? And what if we take a moment to consider the inevitable questions that will arise as we move forward with this emerging technology?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nA new 3D printing method promises faster, multi-material creations\nEngineers have designed a method of 3D printing that is five to 10 times faster than the quickest high-resolution printer currently available.\n \n\n\n\n \nNew nanoscale 3D printing material offers better structural protection\nEngineers have designed a new material for nanoscale 3D printing that is able to absorb twice as much energy and could be used to create better lightweight protective lattices.\n \n\n\n\n \nIs there a better way to do 3D printing?\nEngineers at Stanford and Harvard have laid the groundwork for a new 3D printing system that doesn\u2019t require an object to be printed from the bottom up.\n \n\n\n\n\n \nMedicine\nBuilding a heart, one layer at a time\nUsing advanced 3D printing techniques, Mark Skylar-Scott and his team want to transform a paste made of living cells into hearts and other organs.\n \n\n\n\n \nEngineering a new heart, layer by layer\n In the hopes of helping children with congenital heart defects, Mark Skylar-Scott is engineering heart tissue in the lab using advanced 3D printing techniques.\n \n\n\n\n \n'Metalheads' course teaches scope of materials science and engineering\nFrom ancient coins to 3D printed spaceships, students in the course Metalheads of Science learn about the broad applications of materials science through the lens of metals.\n \n\n\n\n \nA new approach to vaccinations: 3D printed patches\nResearchers published a paper detailing a vaccine patch prototype, demonstrating that the concept was not only feasible but also potentially more effective than injected vaccinations at generating a robust immune response.\n \n\n\n\n \nEngineering health through 3D printing\nStanford Engineering professors discuss 3D printing and major advances in health care that have resulted from the burgeoning technology \u2013 from vaccine patches and nanoscale robots to life-saving heart tissues.\n \n\n\n\n \nJoseph DeSimone: How 3D printing is changing medicine\nWith growing precision and new materials, 3D printing stands to reshape health care.\n \n\n\n\n\n \nScience & Technology\nTouch-based display helps blind people create in three dimensions\nStanford researchers designed a tactile display that aims to make 3D printing and computer-aided design accessible to people who are blind and visually impaired.\n \n\n\n\n \nTeaching & Students\nA novel approach to cardiac surgery\nStanford medical student Kevin Cyr is part of a team of researchers using 3D printing to build custom cardiac surgical devices.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn The Spotlight\nScience & Technology\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to read next:\n\n\n\n\n \nScience & Technology\nA better, faster tool for saving water on farms\nA new tool for designing and managing irrigation for farms advances the implementation of smart agriculture, an approach that leverages data and modern technologies to boost crop yields while conserving natural resources.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \nScience & Technology\nBanking on nature\nThe Natural Capital Project is working with development banks and 10 pilot countries to put the environment at the forefront of policy and investment decisions.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \nLaw & Policy\nBeyond the room where it happened\nYou may have given little thought to the role Native Americans played in the creation of the U.S. Constitution. But SLS scholars argue that Native people profoundly shaped the conversation.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Report\nTo receive Stanford news daily,\nsubscribe to Stanford Report.\n\n\nFor Journalists\n\nPress Releases\nMedia Contacts\nStanford Experts\n\n\n\nSee Also\n\nContact Stanford News\nFaculty / Staff Resources \n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\nEvents calendar\n\n\n\nStanford News is a publication of Stanford University Communications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Home\nMaps & Directions\nSearch Stanford\nEmergency Info\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy\nCopyright\nTrademarks\nNon-Discrimination\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University. \u00a0 Stanford, California 94305.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
