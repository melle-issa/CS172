She\u2019s been a stage manager, director, costume fabricator, and more\u2014all in service of the compelling stories the department tells.\nDespite spending most of her time out of the spotlight, she\u2019s become a star thanks to her role as a student leader and advocate. The story of Saxon\u2019s transformative experience at Chico State, and in turn, the influence she\u2019s had on the department as an empowered member of the campus community, is the kind Chico State\u2019s faculty and staff strive to make space for.\nSaxon will graduate with honors this May with a degree in theatre arts and leave a vital legacy, having helped create lasting change in the department\u2019s people, policies, and practices.\nHer Visit\nWhen Saxon visited Chico State with her best friend from Southern California, she already had plans to attend school in Boston or Seattle, and was leaning toward a degree in psychology.\nAfter a tour of campus and lunch at The Bear, she recalled walking back toward the car and feeling the first drops of rain fall. This quickly shifted to hail and lightning. \u201cWe were running from building to building, trying to hide under eaves, but soon we realized there was no point,\u201d she said, noting that the sudden change felt like a sign. \u201cWe just walked through the rain. Right then, I just knew that I was supposed to go (to Chico State).\u201d She also knew, as if by divine intervention, that her future lay in theatre.\nHer Vision\nSaxon did not have plans to star in Singing in the Rain. She envisioned herself as a stage manager, and eventually a director. She wanted to pull the rope that engages the sprinklers or find just the right-looking umbrella. She wanted to organize the ambiance, set the vision for the actors, and provide an outlook for the lighting. Saxon set an audacious course for herself, and as soon as she shared it with Associate Department Chair Matthew Teague Miller, he was sold. He offered her an assistant stage manager position for the play She Kills Monsters at the start of her first year.\n\u201cI have rarely had a student as proactive about their own education and growth as Gaby, and that started from the first day we spoke,\u201d Miller said. \u201cFrom day one, she\u2019s made the most of her four years here.\u201d\n\nHer Voyage\nSaxon pressed forward into new and exciting territory each year. But more storms were ahead.\u00a0First came the doubts. On the set of She Kills Monsters, Saxon questioned her abilities. She was insecure about her inexperience.\n\u201cI was just trying to not get in the way,\u201d Saxon recalls. \u201cBut Matty (Miller) and (former faculty member) Jacob Brown and the students in the cast were fantastic and supportive. I feel like everyone in this department really believed in me when I didn\u2019t believe in myself. It\u2019s because of that belief and support that I\u2019m where I am today.\u201d\nDuring her sophomore year, that same support system taught Saxon an even more valuable lesson. A health scare, instability in her living situation, and her first assignment as a stage manager combined to create feelings of fear and flooding.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell my directors what was going on because I felt like I needed to be someone they could rely on, but they helped me realize that asking for help is important,\u201d Saxon said.\nShe\u2019s gone on to work as the stage manager for four more shows and been a wardrobe supervisor in another.\nHer Voice\nSaxon wanted new experiences beyond stage managing. And she boldly asked Miller for a shot at directing\u2014an opportunity undergraduate students rarely get\u2014at the perfect time.\n\u201cI was in a conundrum,\u201d said Miller. \u201cI was this white male set to direct Legally Blonde, a show about a young woman finding her voice, when Gaby said she needed an opportunity to direct. I knew she had the heart and willingness to learn.\u201d Of course, she rose to the occasion. \u201cEverything I gave her, she said yes. We were 50-50 in terms of our contributions to the project.\u201d\nLast December, Saxon directed the one-act play No Exit from start to finish, rummaging around in costume storage for what the actors would wear, casting the show, pulling props and furniture, and determining the tone.\nWritten in France just before D-Day, the play is set in a version of Hell in which three characters are locked together in a plain room. Saxon was particularly proud of her vision to portray a queer character in a more positive light.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a weird show,\u201d admitted Saxon. But she loves that it asks a lot of big questions.\nJust as she has used her voice to create opportunities for herself, she does her best to create the same opportunities for others. As a woman and sister of someone with autism and epilepsy, she is constantly reminded of the disconnect between theatre and many audiences, and how far she believes the industry must go to become equitable and inclusive.\nSaxon was among a pilot group of students who took a \u201cSocial Justice in Theatre\u201d course last year\u2014now a requirement for every theatre and musical theatre major. Saxon said the class helped make her a better human, stage manager, and director through the discovery of improved practices around identities and theatre and the role language can play in helping create a safer space.\n\u201cPeople work best when they\u2019re in a room that feels safe,\u201d Saxon said. \u201cEven on a creative level, the ability to feel comfortable to make decisions and make choices in the room is really important to me, and that\u2019s part of my foundation as a stage manager and a director\u2014making sure that people feel safe and comfortable.\u201d\nAccording to Miller and Elizabeth Grace Davis (her supervisor in the costume shop), Saxon\u2019s focus on social justice, coupled with her ability to merge it with her work in the theatre, has changed the department for the better.\n\n\u201cGaby has become a very powerful person and fierce ally,\u201d Miller said. \u201cShe\u2019s been ferocious about creating a more inclusive environment. Whatever privilege she has, she uses it to advocate for others. She risks standing up to people in power to make positive change wherever she is. For her to have that kind of care at this age and at this point in her career is kind of amazing.\u201d\nHer Vehicles\nSaxon has also left her mark in the theatre department\u2019s policy manual, and in its consent-based practices. Both efforts are designed to make all involved feel safer and more comfortable\u2014values sometimes easy to ignore in the backstage hurry and hullabaloo of a production.\nSaxon was part of a committee of students who reimagined the department\u2019s mission statement, policies, and procedures. She led the effort to create a technological component from scratch\u2014in essence, setting the tone for students who follow in her footsteps as stage managers and directors.\nShe\u2019s also embraced a move toward better practices when it comes to boundaries and consent among theatre workers and students.\nFor the last two summers, Saxon has taken this perspective with her to the Clinton Area Showboat Theatre, a summer stock professional theatre in Clinton, Iowa, where she worked as an assistant stage manager and manager.\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask an actor if it\u2019s within their boundaries for me to mic them today, and they want to know if I\u2019m required to ask that,\u201d Saxon said. \u201cOnce I explain that it\u2019s just part of my practice you can see people begin to feel more comfortable. It also just opens the door for conversations.\u201d\nHer View Forward\nMay is a big month for Saxon. She is the wardrobe supervisor for the Music and Theatre Department production of The Wizard of Oz, which runs May 4\u20137 at Laxson Auditorium. Tickets are still available! She has been devoted to stitching together all the intricate details of a beautiful, bubbly dress to be worn by the actor portraying Glinda, \u201cthe Good Witch of the North.\u201d\nSaxon will graduate with honors a few weeks later, walking across the stage\u2014even if she\u2019s tempted to stay behind the scenes to make sure the show goes just right.\nAfter that, it\u2019s off to Durham, North Carolina, for a summer job as a production stage manager at American Dance Festival.\u00a0\nShe also has a fianc\u00e9, Nolan Mancl. The pair met working at the Showboat in Iowa, and after six months of dating long distance, Mancl moved to Chico and is now attending Chico State. In fact, he composed the music and sound effects for No Exit.\nThey share a passion for advocacy, equity, and inclusion, as well as an artistic drive.\n\u201cHe has always been very supportive of me and my career, and that was important for me with a partner,\u201d Saxon said. \u201cI think it helps that we are both artists, we understand the kind of commitment it takes to do our work.\u201d\nThey\u2019re hoping to be married in early June 2024.\nNo matter where the road ahead leads, she will be building on a solid foundation.\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of what I\u2019ve done in the theatre department,\u201d said Saxon. \u201cBut I\u2019m equally proud of and grateful for the friendships I\u2019ve made and the relationships I\u2019ve built with faculty members on campus.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this Article\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tLuke Reid\t\t\n\n\n\t\tLuke Reid (History, '04; Kinesiology, '09) is a content producer for University Communications.\t\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular \n\n\t\t\t\t\tBusiness Double Major Ready for Life\u2019s Next Big Challenge\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tExpanded CalFresh Eligibility Brings Food Access to More Chico State Students\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWorth Sharing: Health Services Administration College Bowl Team Scores Wins\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLife of Hard Work Pays Off for Agricultural Business Major\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRooted in Connection: The Wildcat Family Tree\t\t\t\t\n\n\nSubscribe to Chico State Today\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tType your email\u2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nChico State Today is an official site of California State University, Chico.\nReport an accessibility issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChico State\n\n\n\nCalifornia State University, Chico\n400 West First Street\nChico, CA 95929\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose Subscribe Pop-Up\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tClose Subscribe Pop-Up\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
