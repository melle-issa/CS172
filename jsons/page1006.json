Researchers say that\u2019s too much for too little data.FacebookTwitterEmailSave StoryFacebookTwitterEmailSave StorySince Twitter launched in 2006, the company has acted as a kind of heartbeat for social media conversation. That\u2019s partly because it\u2019s where media people go to talk about the media, but also because it\u2019s been willing to open up its backend to researchers. Academics have used free access to Twitter\u2019s API, or application programming interface, in order to access data on the kinds of conversations occurring on the platform, which helps them understand what the online world is talking about.Twitter\u2019s API is used by vast numbers of researchers. Since 2020, there have been more than 17,500 academic papers based on the platform\u2019s data, giving strength to the argument that Twitter owner Elon Musk has long claimed, that the platform is the \u201cde facto town square.\u201dBut new charges, included in documentation seen by WIRED, suggest that most organizations that have relied on API access to conduct research will now be priced out of using Twitter.It\u2019s the end of a long, convoluted process. On February 2,\u00a0Musk announced API access would go behind a paywall in a week. (Those producing \u201cgood\u201d content would be exempted.) A week later, he\u00a0delayed the decision to February 13. Unsurprisingly, that deadline also slipped by, as Twitter\u00a0suffered a catastrophic outage.\u00a0The company is now offering three levels of Enterprise Packages to its developer platform, according to a document sent by a Twitter rep to would-be academic customers in early March and passed on to WIRED. The cheapest, Small Package, gives access to 50 million tweets for $42,000 a month. Higher tiers give researchers or businesses access to larger volumes of tweets\u2014100 million and 200 million tweets respectively\u2014and cost $125,000 and $210,000 a month. WIRED confirmed the figures with other existing free API users, who have received emails saying that the new pricing plans will take effect within months. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s an academic on the planet who could afford $42,000 a month for Twitter,\u201d says Jeremy Blackburn, assistant professor at Binghamton University in New York and a member of the iDRAMA Lab, which analyzes hate speech on social media\u2014including on Twitter.\u00a0Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.For subscribers to the cheapest package, the number of rules through which they can filter data from the app\u2019s Real Time PowerTrack API will be capped at 25,000,\u00a0and the number of queries of the Full Archive Search API will be capped at 50,000. The number of Twitter handles they can analyze through the Account Activity API will also be limited to 5,000, and there will be a max of 20 requests per minute for the\u00a0Engagement API Totals Endpoint, which allows researchers to see how well tweets are doing in terms of engagement.While this sounds like a substantial dataset, it only accounts for around\u00a00.3 percent of Twitter\u2019s monthly output, meaning it is far from being a comprehensive snapshot of activity on the platform. Twitter\u2019s free API access gave researchers access to 1 percent of all tweets.Most PopularGearThe 5 Best Laptops for LinuxScott GilbertsonScienceInside the Secretive Life-Extension ClinicFrank SwainGearThe 13 Best Electric Bikes for Every Kind of RideAdrienne SoGearPower Up Anywhere With Our Favorite Portable ChargersSimon HillElissa M. Redmiles, a faculty member at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Germany, says the new prices are eye-watering. \u201cIt\u2019s probably outside of any academic budget I\u2019ve ever heard of,\u201d she says, adding that the price would put off any long-term analysis of user sentiment. \u201cOne month of Twitter data isn\u2019t really going to work for the purposes people have,\u201d she says.Kenneth Joseph, assistant professor at the University of Buffalo and one of the authors of a recent paper analyzing a day in the life of Twitter, says the new pricing effectively kills his career. \u201c$42,000 is not something I can pay for a single month in any reasonable way,\u201d says. \u201cIt totally destroys any opportunity to engage in research in this space, which I\u2019ve in many respects built a career on.\u201d\u00a0The pricing documents were provided to WIRED by a researcher who asked for anonymity, since they are still accessing Twitter data through an existing API agreement and worry it could be terminated if they were identified. They say the new costs were \u201cnot viable for the academic community.\u201d\u201cNo one can afford to pay that,\u201d they say. \u201cEven rich institutions can\u2019t afford to pay half a million a year for a thimbleful of data.\u201dIt\u2019s not clear whom the new pricing model is targeted at. Nir Grinberg, an assistant professor in the \u200bDepartment of Software and Information Systems Engineering at Ben-Gurion University in Israel, used to work at a startup that used Twitter\u2019s data.\u201cIt seems like a really steep increase for a tiny amount of data. One percent of Twitter a few months ago was free. Now Twitter is offering 0.3 percent for half a million dollars [a year],\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just crazy. I honestly don\u2019t know who could budget for this.\u201dResearchers say the damage won\u2019t just be to academic discourse. Twitter is a vital dataset for understanding how the internet works and what conversations are being had in the notional global public square.Joseph recognizes that there are other platforms he could research, but notes that Twitter\u2019s potent combination of journalists, high-ranking politicians, and business decisionmakers makes it a vital area for research. \u201cTwitter is a particularly special space for understanding elite discourse,\u201d he says. \u201cTo rip that away from all of us trying to use the system to understand it is a tough pill to swallow.\u201dBlackburn, however, says researchers will continue to find a way to scrutinize what\u2019s happening on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019ve been mostly cut off from Facebook for years and we\u2019ve continued to make progress,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like science is going to be held hostage by a guy that played himself into burning $44 billion on a website that makes no money, just so he could force all its users to read his shitposts.\u201dGet More From WIRED\ud83d\udce7 Get the best stories from WIRED\u2019s iconic archive in your inbox\ud83c\udfa7 Our new podcast wants you to Have a Nice FutureMy balls-out quest to achieve the perfect scrotumAs sea levels rise, the East Coast is also sinking\u00a0Everything you need to know about ethernetThe case against momfluencersSo your kid wants to be a Twitch streamer\u26fa Embrace the new season with the Gear team\u2019s best picks for best tents, umbrellas, and robot vacuumsChris Stokel-Walker is a freelance journalist and WIRED contributor.
