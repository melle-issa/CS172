We seek to address diversity, inclusion, and equity as critical to the well-being of a democratic culture.\nIn the School of Business and Economics, we recognize our community's success rests on how the SBE values, engages, and includes our diverse students, faculty, staff, and alumni. We aim to create an inclusive, supportive space where our community is inspired to action through business and economics for positive professional and community impact.\nIn pursuit of this inclusive excellence initiative, the School of Business and Economics has adopted the Association of American Colleges & University's Making Excellence Inclusive core principles of diversity, inclusion, and equity.\nRead SBE's Inclusive Excellence Task Force's Mission Statement\nA highlight of Inclusive Excellence initiatives in the SBE @ SSU\nSBE Ambassadors Network: A peer mentor program that connects upper classmen with first generation, first year business and economics students.\nWine Industry Scholars Program (WISP):\u00a0This scholarship program is dedicated to supporting the access, retention, and graduation of first-generation students from economically and socially disadvantaged backgrounds. WISP offers approximately $150,000 in scholarships annually to students who are children of vineyard and winery workers.\u00a0\nRodney Strong Pathways Program:\u00a0This program aims to\u00a0bring a broad range of talented students to SSU, and provide them with a better educational experience to foster their academic career and life success.\u00a0The Rodney Strong Pathways Program augments existing support services of the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP), which recruits students who are the first in their families to attend college, or who come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, by engaging all EOP students during each of their years on campus, providing co-curricular training in financial literacy, entrepreneurship, career guidance, and leadership. This program aims to positively impact more than 600 students each year.\nEntrepreneurship & Innovation: With generous support from the Kalmanovitz Foundation, the SBE provides support for students, particularly those who are first-generation and of underserved populations, who want to start their own business, by turning their ideas into a viable opportunity.\u00a0\nDiversity and Inclusion Workshops:\u00a0Each semester, the SBE partners with organizations across campus, like the SSU HUB, to provide diversity and inclusion training for all faculty and staff. In addition, the SBE partnered with the SSU Faculty Center, to offer training workshops on various topics, including evidence-based teaching practices, testing what you teach without teaching to the test, measuring teaching effectiveness, and classroom management. These workshops are intended to provide faculty with opportunities for continuous teaching development.\u00a0\nStudent Success Workshops: Series focused on training and equipping faculty with toolkits for effective teaching and engagement with diverse student populations.\nUpward Bound:\u00a0SBE faculty, staff, and administrators engage with eighth-grade\u00a0and high school\u00a0students to help them explore potential\u00a0majors offered in college and start thinking about potential career paths.\u00a0\nEducation Opportunity Program (EOP): We partner with EOP to connect with first-year freshmen, particularly undeclared students when they are making the critical decision of choosing a major. Faculty, staff, and administrators meet with students to help students determine the best path forward.\u00a0\nResources for Diversity and Inclusiveness in the Wine Sector\nWomen of the Vine\nPOC Wine Lovers\nBlack Female Project\nVon Vino\nMcBride Sisters\nJulia Coney\nAAA Vintners\nWine Industry Advisor\nMeet Patrice Balmer\nVine Pair\nWillamette Valley Wine\nDid you know?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSBE faculty and staff speak 9 different languages.\n\n\n\n\nIndonesian\nFrench\nItalian\nGerman\nSpanish\nPortuguese\nHmong\nKorean\nChinese\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n21% of our students are first-generation.\n\n\n\n\nNearly a quarter of our business and economics students are the first in their family to attend college.\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool of Business & Economics\n\nSBE Home\nSBE Undergraduate Programs\nSBE Graduate Programs\nScholarships\nWine Business Courses & Certificates\nFaculty & Research\nWine Business Institute (WBI)\nCenter for Professional Engagement\nEntrepreneurship & Innovation\nEntrepreneurship Hub\nPress Releases\nSBE Calendar\nAbout SBESBE Dean's Advisory Council\nAccreditation\nInclusive Excellence\nGraduation & Retention\nStaff\n\nAlumni & Community\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFacebook for SBE \n\n\n Twitter for SBE\n\n\nInstagram for SBE\n\n\nYouTube for SBE\n\n\nLinkedIn for SBE\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive to SBE \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch form\n\nSearch \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSU Facebook\nSSU Twitter\nSSU Instagram\nSSU Youtube\nSSU News RSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Ave\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n707.664.2880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact SSU\nPrivacy Notice\nCalifornia State University\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSafeSSU\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\nEmergency Information\nJobs\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
