                  Learn About the FarmAgriculture can\u2019t be learned solely from a textbook. That\u2019s why our 800-acre Paul L. Byrne Memorial University Farm is so important to our educational program. It\u2019s the place where our students literally get their hands dirty putting into practice the concepts they learn in the classroom.The University Farm was established in 1960 through the efforts of its namesake, Senator Paul L. Byrne. The facility supports classes in agriculture in the same way a chemistry lab supports its discipline. Whether participating in class labs or working as part-time employees, thousands of students have benefited from the University Farm, located on Hegan Lane, five miles south of the main CSU, Chico campus.The farm serves more than just students. Farmers and ranchers benefit from research conducted on the farm, and the farm\u2019s produce and meat sales have long been popular in the Chico community. Grade-school field trips are also a long-standing Chico tradition. Thousands of children tour the farm annually. For most of them it is their first exposure to live farm animals and hands-on interaction with farming. The farm is also the site of countless professional seminars and Future Farmers of America and 4-H field days.\n                        Contact Us\n                    You may contact the farm office by\u00a0calling 530-898-6343.Directions to the farmCollege of AgriculturePlumas Hall, Room 317 530-898-5844AgOutreach@csuchico.eduSupport our CollegeProgram PortfolioCollege Majors\u00a0& ProgramsBachelor of ScienceAgricultural BusinessAnimal ScienceAgricultural Science\nOption in Agricultural Science and EducationOption in Communication and LeadershipPlant and Soil Science\nOption in Crops and HorticultureOption in Land and Soil Resource ManagementMasters of ScienceAgricultural Education(opens in new window)\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.Contact UsNeed Help?FacebookFacebookTwitterTwitterInstagramInstagramReport an accessibility issueReport a broken link on this pageTitle IXPrivacy PolicyCalifornia State University, Chico400 West First StreetChico, CA 95929Copyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n",
