Suddenly, a newcomer became unresponsive.\nDorfer, who is president of SRJC\u2019s Second Chance Club for formerly incarcerated students, rushed to his car to retrieve a Narcan nasal sprayer, which he had received only a week earlier from the school\u2019s health services staff.\nIt took two doses to revive the stranger, whom he\u2019s not seen since.\n\u201cIt's a...it's an emotional thing because nobody wants to be put in a situation where they have to save somebody\u2019s life,\u201d Dorfer said last week. \"But when it happens, it's like the feeling is genuine and it\u2019s, it's very emotional.\u201c\nAmid the ongoing opioid crisis \u2014 where synthetic drugs like fentanyl are playing an outsized role \u2014 Dorfer said more students should learn how to use potentially life-saving drugs such as Narcan, the most well-known brand name for naloxone hydrocloride.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the goal of a new state law that requires California state universities and community colleges to make naloxone and overdose prevention information more readily available to students. The new law, which look effect Jan. 1, also requires community colleges to provide information about the availability of naloxone during student orientation.\nAt SRJC, naloxone nasal spray has been available through the Health Services Center since 2019, but many students are unaware of its availability and proper use, said Rebecca Norwick, director of the school\u2019s Student Health Services.\n\u201cThe bill will make a difference because I do not believe a large percentage of the students know that we have the Narcan for distribution,\u201d said Norwick, who is a nurse practitioner.\nNorwick said the campus is planning a greater push for both outreach and distribution of the medication, such as placement in first aid kits in various campus departments and buildings, as well as in the nearly completed 258-unit, five-story student housing building on the southeast corner of Elliott Avenue and Armory Drive.\nShe said staff are working out the logistics of widespread placement of the drug; unlike band aids and sterile gauze, Narcan expiration dates would require periodic restocking by health services staff.\n\u201cWe're opening student housing in the fall, so that is definitely a location that we're going to be doing naloxone outreach to recommend that students have it in their first aid kit, because people will be there 24 hours a day,\u201d Norwick said.\nA national and local crisis\nNationally, 67 percent of  the 107,375 people who died of overdoses and drug poisonings during a 12-month period ending January 2022 involved synthetic opioids like fentanyl, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nDrug enforcement experts have said that poor quality control of counterfeit opioids and other drugs laced with fentanyl are responsible for a large share of these deaths and emergency visits.\nAccording to data from the Sonoma County\u2019s District Attorney\u2019s Office, there were 109 fentanyl deaths in the county in 2021. The local coroner\u2019s office reports that in the first 11 months of 2022 there were 74 drug deaths caused by accidental overdoses, most involving fentanyl intoxication.\nEven those using opioids as prescribed run the risk of addiction. As many as a quarter of all residents taking opioids prescribed to them for an extended period of time will end up struggling with dependency issues.\nHow it works\nNorwick explains that ingesting too much of an opioid, such as morphine, or something laced with fentanyl, can completely suppress a person\u2019s respiratory system. Their breathing either slows way down or stops altogether, often resulting in cardiac arrest.\nShe stressed that Narcan is not a substitute for emergency medical treatment and people should contact a first responder immediately.\nNorwick said that when a person is found unconscious and is suspected of having a drug overdose, \u201cyou put the person on their back and then you squirt (the naloxone) into their nose and then you turn them on their side. so if they vomit they don't inhale the vomit.\u201d\nShe said naloxone \u201cworks really well and very quickly. It is quite dramatic. So the person can wake up immediately if the cause was an opioid overdose.\u201d\nNaloxone won\u2019t work if the overdose happens because the person took too much Valium or some other sedative, she said.\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe opioid is attached to the cell and the Narcan comes through and it knocks the opioids off of the cells...it's very specific,\u201d Norwick said. She added that the current push for a much wider use of naloxone is safe because it has almost no serious side effects.\n\u201cIf the person is unconscious because of a heart attack \u2014 you just can't tell \u2014 and you give them Narcan, it will not injure them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's safe and it works very well and very quickly.\u201d\nSonoma State University Dean of Students Ryan Jasen Henne likens the current push for greater awareness of naloxone\u2019s life-saving potential to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR.\nHenne said the opioid crisis is \u201cvisible\u201d across the country and putting naloxone in the hands of students who might need it could ultimately save lives.\n\u201cIf more people are aware of how to administer CPR then they can save someone\u2019s life. The more people (who) have access and availability to naloxone could...save people's lives,\u201d Henne said. \u201cSo it's not just about meeting the expectations of a (state law), it\u2019s really about saving lives and taking care of students.\u201d\n\nAt Sonoma State, and also SRJC, campus police officers have been equipped with Narcan for several years, and it\u2019s included in their medical kits as well. They are likely the first reponders to a campus overdose incident.\nSonoma State Police Chief Nader Oweis said in June 2020,  a campus police sergeant administered Narcan to someone who had overdosed. Oweis said Sgt. Neal Mackenzie was dispatched to a call for medical aid involving a visitor to the campus who was unresponsive and not breathing.\nMackenzie quickly recognized that the individual was suffering from a possible drug overdose and he immediately administered Narcan and provided additional care until fire and ambulance personnel arrived, Oweis said.\nCampus police regularly carry the nasal spray but at some point will be transferring to an injectible version similar to the Epinephrine injectors, or EpiPens, he said.\nOweis said the campus is currently working on a plan, due out in the next few months, to bolster its training around the use of naloxone. The plan includes campus visits by expert speakers on opioid use and overdose dangers, along with other drug and alcohol use issues.\nSonoma State students can get access to Narcan through the Health Services Center, as well as the police department, where all the officers have been trained to administer the medication.\nAt SRJC\u2019s Health Services Clinic, small Narcan nasal spray boxes, which have two applicators, are kept in the center\u2019s pharmacy room. Each box contains instructions on how to use the medication.\nNorwick described SRJC\u2019s \u201cnaloxone program\u201d as robust even prior to the new state law. The campus has always been able to get the amount of medication requested, she said, usually 75 boxes a year. The campus currently has 20 units in the health center.\nNorwick said that when a student comes to the campus clinic to ask for Narcan, they are also provided with a link to video instructions on how to use it. She said student questions are often mixed with certain anxieties and fears about using the medication.\nShe said student questions include: \u201cAre there side effects? Is it safe? How do you do it? Is it easy to do? Would it hurt anyone? And also why should I carry it?\u201d\nIdeally, everyone would have naloxone in their first aid kit, she said.\n\u201cThere might be a friend or a family member or your teenage child's acquaintance who might be found unconscious and anyone could save that person's life,\u201d she said.\nNorwick said it only takes a little bit of instruction or training for students to overcome their anxiety or fear of administering naloxone. She applauded the state legislature\u2019s focus on making it more available.\n\u201cThis was an important bill,\u201d she said. \u201cNaloxone is an amazing resource for community members, including our students, and having it readily available is an important aspect of our fight against the opioid crisis that we have in Sonoma County and in the United States.\u201d\nYou can reach Staff Writer Martin Espinoza at 707-521-5213 or martin.espinoza@pressdemocrat.com.
