Core contributor Jonathan Bossenger started the project in 2019 with a proposal to build a unified notification center in WordPress that would replace the chaos caused by developers hooking into admin notices, which was not designed to be a notification system.\nIn the latest 0.2.0 update of the feature plugin, contributors have implemented a more robust JavaScript-based system for standardizing how notifications appear in the admin.\n\u201cWhat originally started as a\u00a0UX proof of concept\u00a0has evolved into a more sophisticated\u00a0JS-based system for displaying notifications based on serialized data,\u201d WordPress core contributor Joe Bailey-Roberts said. \u201cAt the moment this uses static dummy data, however in a future update this will interface with the upcoming REST controllers to display persistent data.\u201d\n\nThe project is restructuring its leadership with Bossenger stepping down as the lead and Bailey-Roberts taking over the position. \nAlthough WP Feature Notifications currently exists as a feature plugin, its contributors are intent on seeing it merged into core when ready, instead of kept as a canonical plugin. They are eager to see the project\u2019s design and functionality work in concert with the planned modernization of the admin as part of Gutenberg Phase 3.\n\u201cNotification functionality is indeed fundamental, and already in constant use via the admin_notices hook, a workaround that has major issues of standardization and\u00a0accessibility,\u201d Bailey-Roberts said. \u201cThe new\u00a0API\u00a0needs to be universal, and available by default, otherwise admin_notices will remain the de facto option.\u201d\nContributors plan to remove the demo content from the plugin in version 0.3.0 and make it into an MVP (minimum viable product) with a functional notification system. \n\u201cThe next (and largest) piece of the puzzle is persistent database storage of notification data,\u201d Bailey-Roberts said. \u201cWe\u2019re working on finalizing the proposed schema, as well as discussing other issues such as retention, translations,\u00a0multisite\u00a0support, and more.\u201d\nIn order to keep moving the project forward, contributors are seeking a partnership with a core committer for guidance on preparing the plugin to be a good candidate fore core, as well as additional contributors with PHP and SQL expertise. The feature plugin is available on GitHub for testing.\nA solution for notifications in WordPress is critical for improving the admin experience for every user. A standardized way of displaying notifications will make site management a more predictable and less cognitively draining task. The WP Feature Notifications project is still in the early stages but it has some momentum and it needs help. Contributors can join the team\u2019s weekly office hours on WP Slack in the\u00a0#feature-notifications channel, and the project will also have representation at WordCamp\u00a0Europe\u2019s\u00a0Contributor Day.\nCategory: News, WordPressShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Like thisLike Loading\u2026\n\n1\n\n\n\n\t\tOne response to \u201cWP Feature Notifications Project Progresses Towards MVP for Standardizing Admin Notifications\u201d\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Drivingralle says: \n\nApril 29, 2023 at 8:57 AM \n\n\nLooking forward of this feature to get into WP core\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
