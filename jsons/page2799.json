The study finds that while the laid off workers broadly support the region\u2019s transition to a clean energy economy, they faced significant financial strain, mental health challenges and difficulty securing high-quality, union jobs in the aftermath of the refinery shutdown.\n\n\u201cOil and gas workers are highly skilled, hard-working experts who have so much to offer in emerging clean industries. We recognize the need for this nationwide change, and we want to be a part of it \u2014\u00a0but we can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d said Tracy Scott, president of United Steelworkers Local 5, which represented 345 of the approximately 700 workers laid off at the facility. \u201cThe personal, financial and generational impact of these closures on working people is immense. Elected leaders must do better, from a public policy standpoint, to ensure those impacted by the transition to a clean economy are supported.\u201d\nIn October 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic raged across the country, the Marathon oil refinery in Martinez, CA shut down after 100 years of operation. Hundreds of workers were laid off, losing stable, union jobs. While 3 out of 4 former Marathon workers eventually found new work, they made a median $12 an hour\u00a0less than prior to their layoff, the study finds. Another 26 percent of workers remained unemployed one year after their layoff.\u00a0\nFunded by the State of California\u2019s Workforce Development Board, the study found that 91 percent of the surveyed former Marathon workers are willing to enroll in a subsidized training program, but many workers were apprehensive about the efficacy of training, in the absence of clear pathways into job opportunities with comparable pay and benefits. The report, commissioned by UC Berkeley, compiles a set of recommendations for local, state and federal leaders to better support workers through job and career transitions and lays out a blueprint for leaders to ensure equitable transition to clean energy for all workers.\u00a0\n\u201cCalifornia leads the nation in the shift to clean energy, and our state must also be a leader in supporting workers through this transition,\u201d\u00a0said Tim Rainey, Executive Director of the California Workforce Development Board. \u201cBuilding an economy where working families can prosper requires that elected leaders and employers listen to workers, plan ahead and get creative in finding solutions that support and empower people as they move into new roles. UC Berkeley\u2019s report offers critical insights about how we can navigate the challenges of our changing economy, based on workers' real experiences.\u201d\nThe energy transition is already happening, Parks said, \u201cbut we cannot be transitioning the economy at the expense of workers and the communities they live in.\u00a0The experience of the Marathon workers clearly demonstrates the need for proactive, worker-centered policies and supports in order to build a high-road, carbon-neutral economy.\u201d\nMarathon Martinez Workers Struggle to Recover Post-Layoff\nThe UC Berkeley study paints a stark picture of the deep financial and personal hardships facing those laid off following the shutdown and repurposing of this oil refinery mid-pandemic. One-third of workers surveyed said they were falling behind financially \u2014 up from only 3 percent before the layoffs \u2014 and nearly a one-third took early withdrawal from their retirement accounts to make ends meet.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI was devastated,\u201d\u00a0said James Feldermann, a former Marathon refinery worker who was laid off. \u201cIt's not losing a job, it's losing a career. It's losing where you were going to retire from.\u201d\nA majority of respondents also stated that they cycled through two or more jobs in the year after their layoff, and many expressed frustration with the lack of safety protections or union representation in their new jobs. What\u2019s more, a quarter of workers encountered problems applying for or receiving unemployment insurance and another quarter didn\u2019t apply for UI at all.\u00a0\nWhile all of the workers who responded to the survey were members of United Steelworkers Local 5 during their employment at the Marathon refinery, only 43 percent held union jobs after the closure. Without the strength of a union behind them, the former Marathon workers reported losing the ability to advocate effectively for better pay, benefits and training.\u00a0\n\u201cOur top priority as a union is keeping our members at work,\u201d said USW District 12 Director Gaylan Prescott, who represents workers in California and ten other Western states, \u201cbut we also fight for workers when the worst happens. Our union is committed both to connecting laid-off oil and gas workers with existing resources and continuing to push employers and policymakers to provide long-term solutions.\u201d\nWorker-Informed Solutions Key to an Equitable Transition\nIn consultation with former refinery workers interviewed for the study, the report compiles a list of recommendations for how federal, state and local leaders should approach the transition to clean energy and support the growing ranks of displaced workers across California and nationwide. The worker-recommended solutions include:\n\nCash support to ensure those laid off by oil refineries can keep their families afloat during transition periods, including extended unemployment benefits, and financial aid to cover the 24% average gap in workers pre-layoff wages.\nSkill certification and subsidized training, to help workers transition their expertise and credentials into new sectors and into roles that match their years of experience.\nTargeted, individualized job search assistance and affordable training targeted towards oil and gas workers searching for employment in a new sector.\nFinancial planning and bridge-to-retirement funding, to both support working families post-layoff and provide full retirement benefits to workers eligible for early retirement following layoff.\nAccess to counseling, health care, and transparent communication for workers and their families, including mental health support\nEmpower unions to provide information, communication and resources to workers transitioning between jobs\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to recognize that, as we move towards cleaner sources of energy, hardworking, union refinery workers have played a critical role in powering California for generations,\u201d\u00a0said Chris Markuson, Western States Director of the BlueGreen Alliance. \u201cThis report provides valuable insights into the transition challenges workers are likely to face and highlights opportunities to support them and their communities as we build a cleaner and more equitable economy.\u201d\n\nRelated:\nThe Atlantic:\u00a0The Blue-Collar Workers Left Behind by the Green Economy\nUCI opens Labor Center\nUCI Labor Center website\nFaculty Spotlight: Virginia Parks\n\nContact:\nMimi Ko Cruz\nDirector of Communications\n949-824-1278\nFeatures\n\nShare\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us on social media\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nLinkedIn\nInstagram\nFlickr\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\nEmployment\nAdministrative Services\nUCI Homepage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUC Irvine\nSchool of Social Ecology\n5300 Social and Behavioral Sciences Gateway\nIrvine, CA 92697-7050\n\u00a9 2020\u00a0UC Regents\nWebsite Questions\nWebsite Accessibility\nRequest Web Login\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLogin\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
