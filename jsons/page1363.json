In an interview with Michael Simms for Coal Hill Review in 2012, Collins stated that she \u201clearned that I\u2019m usually onto something when I hear the censor\u2019s voice.\u201d It is Collins\u2019 ability to push past the mental censorship that was developed deep within her from parents and teachers, critics and society that has made her so successful as a writer who understands what it means to \u201cwrite white.\u201d\nMy first taste of Martha Collins came subtly, in the form of a book called Blue Front, a book of poems that took me by surprise. What unfolded in front of me was not \u201cjust a book of poems\u201d but a fantastic artistic move in which Collins uses poetry to tell a story unlike any I have ever read. Collins brings us into a scene that is both horrific and raw and adds to it a reality that we often try not to talk about. She does not balk in the face of censorship, but instead, looks it right in the eye and says what she means to say and does so eloquently and passionately.\nWhat Collins does is, as Chico State Creative Writing professor Jeanne Clark states, \u201cengages questions of race in utterly harrowing, necessary and compelling ways.\u201d A great example of her ability to \u201cengage questions of race\u201d can be seen in her book-length poem Blue Front (Graywolf, 2006) where Collins uses white space, historiography, fragmentation and interpretation to describe a lynching her father witnessed when he was only 5 years old. Her father was known for selling fruit in front of the Blue Front Restaurant in Cairo, Illinois, the town in which the lynching took place. The poems create a feeling of frenzy, chaos, hurriedness, and violence. It is done both simply and stunningly, pushing the limits of poetry by using evidence of postcard descriptions, the legal history of the event, and even Collins\u2019 own speculation of what happened.\nCollins\u2019 ability to push censorship and art comes together in her work in a cohesive and deliberate form. In her poem \u201cWhite Papers\u201d she gives a stunning account of the issue of race with simple but raw statements like, \u201cBecause my father said yes/ but not in our lifetimes\u201d and \u201cBecause among the crayons/ there was one called Flesh.\u201d Her use of anaphora brings to light the arguments that have taken place for generations. Her use of language recreates the ways in which we have talked about race in the past and even what we may still talk about it in the future.\nWith three Pushcart Prizes, the Alice Fay Di Castagnola Award, a Lannan residency grant, the Laurence Goldstein Poetry Prize and many fellowships, it is hard to deny Collins dedication to her craft and importance as an American poet. Her most recent book, Admit one: An American Scrapbook (Pittsburgh, 2016) has been praised by Writer\u2019s Chronicle for poetry that is stated to be \u201cpoised at the juncture between the lyric and ethics.\u201d Her other works include Day Unto Day\u00a0(Milkweed, 2014) and White Papers (Pitt Poetry Series, 2012). After attending Stanford University for her B.A. and then the University of Iowa for her Ph.D., Collins taught at the University of Massachusetts Boston where she founded the Creative Writing Program and for ten years was Pauline Delaney Professor of Creative Writing at Oberlin College, and is also editor-at-large for FIELD magazine.\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Martha Collins, Tuesday at 7:30 pm in Colusa 100B.

This story is also part of Fioravanti\u2019s second linked collection, Bridge & Tunnel.\n\u201cLoud Love\u201d was a pleasure to read. The main character is a riot, endearingly imperfect and human, with a proclivity for hysterical honesty. All of the characterizations are complex and unique in a plot that keeps us engaged. The narrative tone in \u201cLoud Love\u201d is realistic and believable, with a tongue-in-cheek attitude that enfolds a story, not just entertaining, but meaningful as well.\nFioravanti is the author of the linked collection of short stories titled Garbage Night at the Opera, winner of the 2011 Sharat Chandra Prize for Short Fiction. Her published short stories have earned a total of six Pushcart Prize nominations and a Special Mention in Pushcart Prize XXVIII. Currently, Fioravanti lives in Sacramento, California, where she works primarily as a creative writing coach and leader of writing workshops.\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Valerie Fioravanti, Thursday at 7:30 pm in Colusa 100B.
