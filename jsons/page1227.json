A knot of complication.\nBut you cannot know a place without loving it and hating it and feeling everything in between.\u201d\nSilas House | Writer, Appalachian studies scholar\n\nAPPALACHIAN\nAWAKENING\nDocumentarian Sally Rubin trains her lens on the shallow stereotypes of a region and ends up diving deeply into a whole new conversation.\nBy Dennis Arp\nArts and Entertainment Chapman Forward\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Challenge Roddie\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSally Rubin was determined to get to know Appalachia \u2013\u00a0 to untie the knot and disentangle the misconceptions that attach themselves to the region. But first she had to find her way there.\n\u201cAppalachia is a construction, a social and cultural invention,\u201d says Chad Berry, a professor of Appalachian studies at Berea College in Kentucky. \u201cIowa is a construction, too. The difference is that you know you\u2019re in Iowa because there\u2019s a sign there that says, \u2018Welcome to Iowa.\u2019 There\u2019s no such sign with Appalachia.\u201d \nBerry is among those interviewed in Rubin\u2019s new feature-length documentary \u201chillbilly.\u201d In researching and shooting the film, Rubin not only found that perceptions of Appalachia are a timely subject for exploration. She learned that Appalachia itself is amorphous, evolving and more diverse than she, and certainly America, might ever have imagined. \n\u201cAt first, we set out to do a historical survey of the development of the hillbilly stereotype in film and TV,\u201d says Rubin, an assistant professor of documentary film at Chapman University.\u00a0 \u201cThen, several months in, we came to realize that if this film is going to be about what Appalachia isn\u2019t, we have to tell what Appalachia is.\u00a0 That\u2019s when we started including the alternative Appalachian perspective.\u201d\nA journey of more than four years is bound to provide twists and turns along the way. This project had plenty, including one the filmmakers didn\u2019t see coming.\n\u201cThe results of the (2016 presidential) election changed the entire context of the film and how we told the story,\u201d said Rubin, who co-directed \u201chillbilly\u201d with Kentucky native Ashley York, who now lives in Los Angeles and teaches at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. \u201cWe always thought the film would be relevant, but suddenly it went from niche-relevant to nationally relevant.\u201d\nToward the end of production, the filmmakers realized they needed a throughline to link all of the story\u2019s themes. So York, who like Rubin is committed to social justice and a feminist approach in her filmmaking, stepped before the cameras to become a character in the film. Weaved throughout are scenes in which York reconnects with her Appalachian family members who attended rallies and voted for President Trump. These nuanced, sometimes tense but always loving conversations add intimacy and urgency to the film. \nIn one scene, York visits her Granny Shelby in Jonesville, Ky. They trade hugs as they\u2019re joined by several other family members who had voted for Barack Obama but now wear MAGA hats. York eases into the role of neutral interviewer as she probes their enthusiasm for Trump. \u201cPeople from the mountains,\u201d she hears, \u201creally had no one to have our back before.\u201d There\u2019s a long pause while York nods awkwardly, and then the inevitable question: \u201cWho\u2019d you vote for?\u201d She purses her lips and reveals that she voted for Hillary Clinton.\n\u201cI must not have burped you girls just right,\u201d her grandmother deadpans. \u201cI should have held you upside down and patted you on your butt.\u201d\n\nFrustrated by Hypocrisy\nFor Rubin, the filmmaking journey connects to the roots of her mother, who grew up in Calderwood, Tenn., in the Great Smoky Mountains. The filmmaker also knows coal country from her 2010 film \u201cDeep Down,\u201d which chronicles friendships and divisions as a way of life erodes in eastern Kentucky. \n\u201cFrom the time I was younger, I\u2019ve been frustrated by the hypocrisy and stereotypes around rural white people,\u201d says Rubin. \u201cGrowing up in liberal Boston, those in my circle wouldn\u2019t be caught dead saying the N word or anything like that, but they would very happily throw around terms like redneck, hillbilly and poor white trash. I noticed that, and it pissed me off.\u201d\n\n\nSally Rubin and her Chapman documentary film students discuss a scene from \u201chillbilly.\u201d\n\nRubin\u2019s pop-culture flashpoint for the project was the character Pennsatucky on the Netflix series \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s this innovative show, with risky storytelling and gender-nonconforming\u00a0 characters, and at the same time there\u2019s this character who\u2019s a tired old mashup of every stereotypical quality of an Appalachian person \u2013 holy roller, meth head, abuser of the welfare system,\u201d Rubin says. \u201cFor me, it was \u2018enough is enough.\u2019\u201d\nOnce York came onboard as a partner in the project, the two launched into a review of scholarly research.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge body of scholarship on the history of Appalachian identity and representation,\u201d Rubin says.\nKey texts include \u201cHillbilly\u201d by Tony Harkins and \u201cHillbillyland\u201d by Jerry Williamson. \u201cAshley and I practically memorized those texts,\u201d says Rubin, who adds that \u201cBelonging\u201d by Bell Hooks also was enlightening. \u201cIt\u2019s all about Southern and Appalachian identity, especially from the vantage point of a woman of color who left and then came back. It helped me look at the region in a new way.\u201d\nIn March 2014, the filmmakers attended the annual Appalachian Studies Association Conference, where they met and interviewed a host of key scholars.\n\u201cEvery single scholar we interviewed became an advisor on our film,\u201d Rubin notes.\nThe Road to a Gripping Story\n\n\nRubin shares insights with students and with Andre Dhont in the Dhont Documentary Film Center of Chapman Studios West.\n\nRubin\u2019s research goals were twofold: \u201cMaking sure we have a wide, diverse and thorough handle on the concepts of the film, and then deciding, \u2018Is this going to make a compelling story?\u2019\u201d\nValidation came in the form of outside funding from state humanities councils in South Carolina, Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia. Later \u201chillbilly\u201d earned two major grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and one from the National Endowment for the Humanities.\nThat support allowed the filmmakers to gather stories during field research trips that crisscrossed six states. \u201cWe knew we needed media clips, and we knew we needed experts talking about what we were seeing in the media clips. But we also wanted stories, so we sought out characters who could bring the human element to the film,\u201d Rubin says.\nIn addition to Billy Redden, the actor who portrayed the banjo player in \u201cDeliverance\u2019\u2019 (and now a Walmart worker in Georgia), \u201chillbilly\u201d gives voice to artists and activists, queer musicians and \u201cAffrilachian\u201d poets \u2013 the flipside of the hackneyed regional stereotypes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to see somebody trying to cover us as we really are and not what some people think we are. It\u2019s wonderful the attention you\u2019ve paid to so many areas that are so important to all of us. I\u2019m proud to have been mentioned in the film a time or two. \u201c\n\u2013 Dolly Parton \u2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud that we were careful to showcase the diversity of the region,\u201d says Samantha Cole, a native of Lee County, Ky., who was interviewed for the film and eventually took on the role of associate producer. \u201cI had known for some time that Appalachia was home to all these different folks, but all those narratives had been buried, shut down.\u201d\nCole has helped the filmmakers develop a companion piece to \u201chillbilly\u201d called\n\u201cHer Appalachia,\u201d which shares interviews with women of the region and takes a critical look at female Appalachian archetypes like the \u201cmountain mawmaw,\u201d \u201csex pot\u201d and \u201cfreeloader.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe film is surprising and refreshing, treating white rural voters generously and expanding cultural understanding of the region. \u2026 For outsiders, the film could potentially challenge viewers\u2019 perceptions; for Appalachians, it\u2019s a cinematic portrayal of which they can be proud.\u201d\n\u2013 From a review by The Nashville Scene \u2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe diverse nature of the region had been at the periphery of my thoughts,\u201d Cole says. \u201cNow I want to seek out those diverse voices that are of and for the region.\u201d\n\n\nCinematographer Bryan Donnell and co-directors Rubin, seated, and Ashley York traversed six states shooting scenes for \u201chillbilly.\u201d\n\nWhen Rubin first reached out to her about a possible on-camera interview more than four years ago, Cole didn\u2019t imagine the journey that would result, including her writing proposals and securing grants.\n\u201cSally was fabulous to work with,\u201d Cole says. \u201cShe provided this big overarching picture, but she was also attentive to details. She\u2019s a great artist and creative thinker, but also a fantastic teacher.\u201d\nCole was there when \u201chillbilly\u201d premiered in May at the Nashville Film Festival, where attendees filled a 250-seat theater and a 115-seat spillover venue as well. Cole saw filmgoers \u201cconnect with the story and afterward say that they had never seen anyone express the same thoughts and feelings they had been holding in for years.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re empowered to have pride in the place we call home,\u201d Cole adds. \u201cThis film not only invites conversations but deep thinking about the media we consume \u2013 in terms of the hillbilly figure yes, but also any minority or oppressed group.\u201d\nRubin says she\u2019s eager to see \u201chillbilly\u201d prompt conversations in family rooms and over kitchen tables, but also in group forums and classrooms, perhaps even after a screening on Capitol Hill.\n\u201cHopefully the film will live in the world for decades and have a broad impact,\u201d Rubin says. \u201cMy dream would be that we would see less vitriol between people from urban and rural backgrounds. The film has universal themes and offers a lot to unpack, so it lends itself to rich conversations. I\u2019d like to see all of those continue.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Dedicates Keck Center for Science and Engineering, Which Promises \u2018an Incredible Future\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\nDrama from the Front Lines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Family Donors Make a Collective Impact On Giving Day\u00a0 Thanks to the enthusiasm of the Chapman Family, Chapman University\u2019s fifth annual Giving Day was an unrivaled success.
