Peggy Shumaker\u2019s most recent book of poems is Toucan Nest, a book of poems set in Costa Rica. \u00a0Her lyrical memoir is Just Breathe Normally. Professor emerita from University of Alaska Fairbanks, Shumaker teaches in the Rainier Writing Workshop. She is founding editor of Boreal Books, publisher of fine art and literature from Alaska.\u00a0 She edits the Alaska Literary Series at University of Alaska Press.\u00a0 Peggy Shumaker was Alaska State Writer Laureate\u00a0for 2010-2012.\nShumaker\u2019s prose in Just Breathe Normally is rhythmic and lyrical, organized in small chapter sections. Her memoir invites the reader to consider the ways genre can blend, overlap and elevate past a single set of conventions or constraints. Her short prose-shaped chapters, consider the poetic image as well as the story threaded between them. The reader is invited to witness the way writing constantly moves, evolves, and anchors itself to the stories we share with one another.\nAs a poet, Peggy has published seven poetry books, two chapbooks, and is featured in twelve anthologies. In her most recent book, Toucan Nest: Poems of Costa Rica, Peggy uses the Costa Rican landscape and its inhabitants to remind us how to re-examine our world with new ways of seeing\u2014questioning and observing, as in her poem, \u201cRamon\u2019s Eyes\u201d:\n\u00a0\nRamon directs us\nto the roadside stand\nwhere on the last day\n\u00a0\nhe picks up queso,\nmango, heart shaped\nmilk candies. Home.\n\u00a0\nIf you ever fly north,\nRamon, nuestro casa\nes su casa.\n\u00a0\nRamon\u2019s eyes fill\u2014\nY mi casa es suyos\u2026\nis small, my house,\n\u00a0\nbut yours.\nRamon, whose daughter chose\nfor her quinceanera\n\u00a0\nsix friends from school,\na cake her mama baked,\nand her family.\n\u00a0\nRamon glances cloudward\nfor the rains, season\nwhen he rests\n\u00a0\nin his own nest\nafter months on the road\nbarely blinking.\n\u00a0\nPlease join us Thursday, November 14th, 7:30 pm for Peggy Shumaker\u2019s reading in Trinity 100.
