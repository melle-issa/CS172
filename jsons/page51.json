We center our work around Academic / Intellectual exploration, Community Building, Alumni Engagement, Leadership Development, and Mental Health & Wellbeing.\u00a0\n\n\n \nA New World in the Making\nThis year\u2019s theme is: New World in the Making. We are asking the community to consider how we will move forward in this space of newness through the year. This will be the first time, in a long time, restrictions have been lifted; but we are still living through a growing list of pandemics. How are we moving forward, while still holding ourselves and each other accountable to safety measures for public health. How are we celebrating? Resting? Working/studying? What will we retain from the past, and what will we create in the present? How do we envision a future on a campus that understands Black lives matter? It\u2019s a lot to think about, but we have a whole school year to ponder and respond!\u00a0Join the Black Community Services Center as we explore the Black excellence and beauty that will grow in this new world.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \nStay Connected!\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Diaspora\nA listserv connecting all of Black Stanford\nClick here to sign up for the Diaspora!
