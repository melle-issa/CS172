In this case, a product tour for translate.wordpress.org can be an excellent way to guide new contributors on translation best practices, even before receiving feedback from translation editorsTranslation Editor Translation editors can approve translations for projects. The GTE (General Translation Editor) and LM (Locale Manager) roles can add new users with the \"Project Translation Editor\" role that can approve translations for specific projects. There are two different Translation Editor roles: \nGeneral Translation Editor and Project Translation Editor.\nIn the Polyglots outreach effort, a need to better educate new translators frequently emerged in the survey responses. While there are visible links to Glossaries and the Polyglots Handbook on project pages, it\u2019s hard to know if translators visit them before contributing their first suggestions.\nWhile the GlotPressGlotPress GlotPress is the translation management software that powers\u00a0Translate.WordPress.org. More information is available at glotpress.org. discussion tool allows translation editors to share feedback more easily, there is also an opportunity to proactively teach translators before their first translation. Relatedly, the Learn WordPress Polyglots Training was partially written with this in mind but is slightly more technical and exists outside translate.wordpress.org.\nAn idea: a guided tour\nTo help improve translation quality from the first suggested translation, I\u2019d like to share the idea of adding a guided tour to translate.wordpress.org, specifically for new translators to learn more about best practices.\nWhat does this mean? When someone logs into translate.wordpress.org for the first time, or after a long time (e.g. > 12 months), a few interactive pointers guide the person through the translation process and the translate.wordpress.org interface.\nExample using WordPress pointers.\nThe goal would be to encourage translation best practices for new or returning translators. Including key steps\u2014like \u201cCheck your localeLocale Locale = language version, often a combination of a language code and a region code, for instance es_MX denotes Spanish as it\u2019s used in Mexico. A list of all locales supported by WordPress in https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/\u2019s style guide before submitting your suggestion\u201d or \u201cHave you requested feedback from your translation editors on Make/Polyglots?\u201d\u2014encourages new contributors to follow guidelines set by their locale teams.\u00a0\nWhen new contributors are familiar with resources like the local Style Guide, Glossary, or review process, it can help improve translation quality. Better quality equally means fewer corrections from translation editors. It can also mean encouraging people to opt into the discussion tool, making sharing feedback easier and seeing their translations accepted more quickly.\u00a0\nFeedback request\nThere are infinite ways to implement something like this. Taking inspiration from other open sourceOpen Source Open Source denotes software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.  Open Source **must be** delivered via a licensing model, see GPL. communities, Pontoon\u2014the translation tool for Mozilla\u2014has a standalone walk-through that allows translators to test the tool before they start translating. WordPress, as another example, offers pointers in the Dashboard.\nWhat do you think? In particular, I would love to hear:\nDo you think this would help with translation quality in your locale team?\nWhat are the most common errors you see from new contributors?\nWhen should the tour happen? For example, in translate.wordpress.org, while someone suggests their first translations or in a separate, interactive site, like this example?\nOne of the biggest challenges would be keeping the tour updated over time, and it\u2019s not helpful to anyone\u2014translators or developers\u2014to create something that quickly becomes obsolete. For anyone with a design background, I\u2019d be particularly interested in getting your opinion on UXUX UX is an acronym for User Experience - the way the user uses the UI. Think \u2018what they are doing\u2019 and less about how they do it. best practices and maintenance.\nThis is a rough idea! I very much welcome all of your thoughts and perspectives to explore this proposal.\u00a0Share this:FacebookTwitterLogin to ReplyTo-do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntobifjellner (Tor-Bjorn Fjellner)\n\n10:50 pm on April 14, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nSomething like this was already done some time ago by @theogk See https://wordpress.tv/2021/07/05/tor-bjorn-fjellner-theodoros-gkitsos-getting-started-translating-wordpress-themes-and-plugins-into-different-languages/\nBut since then the interface and possibilities have evolved, so it\u2019s probably time for an updated version.\nOr are you thinking of a different format?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErica Varlese\n\n3:35 pm on April 17, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nYes! I agree with you and @kharisblank \u2013 that video is an amazing resource, and would likely benefit from an update as well.\nFor this proposal/idea specifically, I was thinking of incorporating the tour directly into translate.wordpress.orgtranslate.wordpress.org The platform for contributing to the translation of WordPress core, themes and plugins. using something like tooltips or something similar to Pontoon, which is a standalone, interactive tour of the Mozilla translation platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKharis Sulistiyono\n\n2:29 am on April 15, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nGreat idea @evarlese!\nI agree with you that the way we communicate the translation process to new contributors should be improved to get them get their first contributions more confidence at their early stage.\nJust to give you an additional reference, back in 2020, @ivankristianto (id LocaleLocale Locale = language version, often a combination of a language code and a region code, for instance es_MX denotes Spanish as it\u2019s used in Mexico.
