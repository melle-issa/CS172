Visit our FAFSA or\u00a0\u00a0California\u00a0DREAM Act\u00a0pages for further information.\nMoreover, you can apply to all UC campuses using the same application,\u00a0My UC Application.\u00a0An application fee of $70 is required for each campus you apply to. There is a fee waiver that can cover the application fee for up to 4 campuses, if eligible.\nTo learn more about tuition and cost of attendance, click on the following link:\nTuition & Cost of Attendance\nHow do UC schools differ from CSUs?\nAlthough UC schools generally\u00a0have higher prestige, both Cal States and UC's are good choices and offer a quality education while still having their own drawbacks. To learn more about\u00a0the aspects of attending a UC campus, click on\u00a010 Important Things to Know About the University of California\u00a0for further information.\n\n\n\n\nRequirements for enrollment - UCs\nHigh School GPA\nThe UC or\u00a0CSU GPA used when determining admission only includes grades for classes in Grades 10 and 11. Remember, GPA calculation is different from A-G\u00a0requirements.\u00a0For further information, visit UC Admissions Requirements site.\nEvery UC has\u00a0their own specific way to calculate the grade point average (GPA) it requires for admission. However, California\u00a0applicants must earn at least a\u00a03.0 GPA\u00a0and nonresidents must earn a minimum\u00a03.4 GPA\u00a0in all A-G or college-preparatory courses to meet this requirement.\u00a0\nGPA Calculator\nEntrance Test Scores\nUC will be \"test-optional\" for Fall 2021 and Fall 2022. Freshman applicants are not required to submit SAT/ACT test scores.

The Universities use your responses to learn more about you as an individual-your talents, experiences, achievements, background, intellectual vitality and point of view. Your PIQs, when read along with your academic record, help\u00a0the Universities gain insight into your overall level of achievement.\n\n\nThink of it as your opportunity to introduce yourself to the admissions officers and faculty who will be evaluating your application. What would you like them to know about you that may not be evident from a review of the rest of your application?\n\n\nAfter they have read your PIQs, they will ask themselves, \"What have we learned about this individual?\" If they have learned very little about you, then your efforts have not been successful.\n\n\nWriting PIQs and College Application Essays presentation\n\n\nWriting Tips for College Essays & PIQs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to prepare:\n\n\nRead the essay prompts carefully and follow the instructions.\nNote that the topics are different for freshmen and transfer students.\nYour PIQs\u00a0should reflect your own ideas, and should be\u00a0written by you alone.\n\n\n\n\nHow to write:\n\n\nYou will have 8 questions to choose from. You must respond to any 4 of the 8 questions.\nEach response is limited to a maximum of 350 words.\nWhich questions you choose to answer is entirely up to you. But you should select questions that are most relevant to your experience and that best reflect your individual circumstances.\nAll questions are given equal consideration in the application review process, which means there is no advantage or disadvantage to choosing certain questions over others.\nStick to one topic per response.\nSupport your ideas with specific examples.\nPresent your information and ideas in a focused, in-depth, thoughtful, and meaningful manner.\nUse \"I\" statements.\nPresent a clear picture of who you are and why you deserve to be accepted at the university.\n\n\n\n\nHow to finalize:\n\n\nGive yourself plenty of time to thoughtfully prepare for your essay, as well as time to refine and improve after writing it.\nHave a teacher, counselor, friend, or family member give you feedback after you have written the narrative to see if you have given adequate insight into your essay.\nHave an English teacher proofread your essay.\nFollow the rules for format, length, and content.\nWrite PIQs in a Word document, then \"cut and paste\" into the online application.\nAfter pasting the four responses into the application, click on the \"Count\" button to check the word count.\n\n\n\n\nWhat to avoid:\n\n\nSubmitting hastily prepared responses. It will be very obvious when people read them.\nUsage of inappropriate humor, quotations, clich\u00e9s, or poems.\nRepeating topics or information you have already disclosed on the admission application.\nExperimenting with varied forms and formats. Reader must be able to easily read your narrative.\nListing your accomplishments and honors; a list tells the university what you have done, not who you are.\nIf you apply to UC, DO NOT address your response to a specific campus. You need to \"talk\" to all of the UC campuses in your essay.\nAvoid creative writing. You are ANSWERING QUESTIONS. Creative writing might be appropriate for the Common App or essays for other colleges, but not for the UCs. Don't \"set the scene.\" Answer the question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAL SOAP\n\n\n\nEmail calsoap@csusb.edu\n\n\n\n\nCall Main Phone (909) 537-3638\n\n\n\nLocation:UH-231\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\n\nMonday - Friday: \n 8:00 am - 5:00 pm\n\n\n\n\nSaturday - Sunday: \n Closed\n\n\n\n\n\nFax:\u00a0909.537.7152\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media\n\n\n\nCAL SOAP Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nCAL SOAP Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\nCAL SOAP Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Region\n\n\n\nCSUSB\n\n\nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino\n5500 University Parkway\nSan Bernardino, CA 92407\n+1 (909) 537-5000\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Social Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso of InterestCalifornia State University, San BernardinoSchool of Criminology and Criminal JusticeCalifornia State University Schools \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1 \n\n\n\n\nLogin\n\n\n\n\nmyCoyote\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\nStudent Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB  \nDrupal Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Interest to...\n\n\n\n\nFuture Students\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Students\n   Interests\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nFull-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nPart-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & Visitors\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nAlumni & Friends\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Partners\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nMilitary/Veterans\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 2 \n\n\n\n\nEmployment\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB \nJob Listings\n - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nFaculty Jobs\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nCareer Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHuman Resources\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Employment\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nContact\n  CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nClery Act\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Safety Reports\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTitle IX Notice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure of Consumer Information\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 3 \n\n\n\n\nCampus Services\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Advising\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHousing & Residential Life\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nOmbuds Services\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nParking\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPolice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPsychological Counseling\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nServices to Students with Disabilities\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Health Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Support\n\n\n\n\nTranscripts\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\n\n\n\nNon-Discrimination Notice\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Copyright/DMCA Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
