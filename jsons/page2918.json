However,\u00a0individual instructors will have the option of requiring masks in classes.\u00a0Instructors who require masking should inform students in advance on Canvas, the university\u2019s learning management system, and by email.\nStanford encourages everyone to respect the choices that individuals make about their own masking in many settings.\nTypes of Face MasksN95 respirators, KN95 masks, KF94 masks, and double masking (e.g., cloth face covering over a disposable surgical mask) can provide a higher level of fit and filtration. Surgical masks and double-layer cloth face coverings remain acceptable though they do not provide the same level of personal protection.\nFace coverings used at Stanford should meet the following minimum\u00a0California Department of Public Health recommendations:\n\nFits snugly against the sides of your face and does not have gaps around the nose and chin.\nBe equipped with a nose wire to minimize gaps around the nose bridge.\nCompletely cover the nose and mouth.\nAcceptable types include cloth masks with tightly woven fabric (i.e., cotton) with minimum two layers, disposable/surgical face masks, and masks with inner filter pockets.\n\nNOTE:\u00a0 A face covering does not include a scarf, ski mask, balaclava, bandana, turtleneck, collar or single layer of fabric.\n\n\n\nDo not choose masks that have any of the following characteristics:\n\nFit loosely on your face with large gaps around the nose and chin.\nAre made of fabric that is hard to breathe through.\nHave exhalation valves or vents that allow viral particles to escape.\nGaiters and other loose fitting masks are not acceptable, even if double layered.\n\nIs Stanford Providing Face Masks?We encourage you to provide your own face masks wherever possible, and many members of our community have already procured them for their use outside of Stanford.\nDepartment offices may wish to order mask supplies, using\u00a0SmartMart\u00a0or iProcurement (including for instructors requesting extra masks for students). Contact\u00a0Environmental Health & Safety\u00a0with questions.\nFaculty, staff, postdocs, and students will continue to be able to pick up masks at Arrillaga Family Dining Commons and EH&S testing locations, during open hours.\nN95 Respirator UseIndividuals are advised to review\u00a0N95 Respirator Voluntary Use Guidance\u00a0for important guidance on the safe use of N95s.\nDepartments are to provide required use of N95 respirators to employees where identified jobs have high potential for exposure to known or suspected sources of COVID-19 (e.g., clinical respiratory droplet/ aerosol-generating activities).\nVisit this page\u00a0for information on N95 respirator use during wildfire smoke events.\nFor questions related to Stanford\u2019s response to COVID-19 or other health concerns, please fill out this\u00a0EH&S Health Guidance form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Information\n\nTesting PositiveSymptoms & ExposureCOVID-19 TestingCOVID-19 VaccinationFace Mask GuidanceVisitors and VendorsCleaning and DisinfectionPotential Exposure Building List\n\n\n\nRelevant For\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram Areas\n\n\nBiosafety & BiosecurityEmergency ManagementEnvironmental ProtectionFire SafetyHealth PhysicsLaboratory SafetyOccupational Health CenterOccupational Safety & HealthTraining & Communications\n\n\n\nRoles\n\nBuilding ManagersConstruction ManagersExternal ContractorsHR ManagersLab ManagersLab ResearchersLab Safety CoordinatorsOffice WorkersParents and FamiliesPrincipal InvestigatorsShops WorkersSupervisors/ManagersUniversity Safety Partners\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nAnimal Research Occupational Health and Safety ProgramBiosafety & BiosecurityCampus SafetyChemical SafetyConstruction and MaintenanceCOVID-19 InformationEco/Sustainable PracticesEmergency PreparednessErgonomicsField Research SafetyFire SafetyGeneral Workplace SafetyHazardous MaterialsHealthy BuildingsLab SafetyLab Setup and ShutdownLaser SafetyOccupational Injury and IllnessRadiation SafetyShop / Makerspace SafetyWaste Disposal\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\nCOVID-19 InformationAbout UsBioRAFTChemical Inventory SystemFind an EH&S SpecialistLessons LearnedRecycling and Disposal GuideRegister for TrainingReport a Safety ConcernRequest ServicesSubmit Work RequestWaste TagWeather ConditionsSafety Store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n484 Oak Road, Stanford, CA 94305-8007Phone: 650-723-0448\n\n\nDirections Careers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSU Home\nMaps & Directions\nSearch Stanford\nTerms of Use\nEmergency Info\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University,  Stanford, California 94305.\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\tCopyright Complaints\n\n\n\n\n Back to Top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload full instructions here -> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
