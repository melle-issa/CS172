The theme was named for one of Nor\u00e9n\u2019s favorite stomping grounds, Abisko national park, where he hikes every summer.\n\nAbisko places a strong emphasis on both images and typography, featuring the geometric \u201cPlus Jakarta Sans\u201d font for both headings and paragraph text. Plus Jakarta Sans was designed by Gumpita Rahayu from Tokotype in 2020. It seems to be gaining popularity and was mostly recently featured in the free Lemmony theme we reviewed last month. Plus Jakarta Sans is available as a free variable font and also on Google Fonts.\nAt a font weight of 800, Abisko\u2019s H1 and H2 headings make a major statement in the design across the various templates and patterns. Nor\u00e9n contrasts this with liberal use of whitespace so it doesn\u2019t end up feeling overbearing.\n\nAbisko includes five different style variations, with unique color palettes that will change the entire look and feel of the site. These are found under Appearance > Editor and can be accessed through the Styles panel and applied globally when editing any template.\n\nAbisko packages more than 30 patterns for users to mix and match in creating pages. These include a grid with logo types, various artfully designed gallery layouts, contact section, various calls-to-action, hero patterns with images and background colors, testimonials grid, FAQ section, features list, a pricing table, large numbered lists, a wide separator with vertical margins, and more. \nThe theme also has five full-page layouts available as patterns: About Us, Contact Us, FAQ, Front Page, and a Linktree style page.\n\nThe evolution of WordPress themes, becoming fully editable and packaged with style variations and dozens of patterns, means there is no single screenshot that can fully represent what a theme might look like. Check out the live demo to see what is possible and the page that previews all the block patterns.\n\u201cSame as most block themes, Abisko is really lightweight and fast,\u201d Nor\u00e9n said in a post introducing his theme. \u201cIt has a small CSS file, includes no JavaScript at all, and uses locally hosted variable fonts to keep external requests and page size at a minimum.\u201d\nAbisko is available for free on WordPress.org. Although Nor\u00e9n said he designed it with travel blogs in mind, it\u2019s flexible for many different use cases, including agencies, portfolios, businesses, and personal websites.\nCategory: NewsTags: free wordpress themesShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Like thisLike Loading\u2026\n\n1\n\n\n\n\t\tOne response to \u201cAnders Nor\u00e9n Releases Abisko, a New Free WordPress Theme with 30+ Block Patterns\u201d\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n matze says: \n\nApril 4, 2023 at 10:15 AM \n\n\nThis is so awesome \u2013 Anders Nor\u00e9n you allways come up with overwhelming design and concepts.
