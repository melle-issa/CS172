The college also oversees the operation of the Murillo Family Observatory. The dean oversees the college as a whole and each department consists of its own chair, faculty, administrative, and technical staff. In addition to its bachelor\u2019s degrees, several department offer Master\u2019s programs. Though distinct and in some cases physically separate, all departments interact closely in support of students, collaborative research, shared facilities, and common interests.\nAlthough private and public support continues to be essential, the college has made great strides in recent years in acquiring state-of-the-art facilities and equipment. For example, the Department of Kinesiology has modern laboratories in Human Performance, Biomechanics, Motor Learning, and Hemodynamics. The Department of Biology has a suite of modern imaging systems that include small animal X-rays, epifluorescence, confocal microscopy, microinjection and microfluidics analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.\u00a0 There are also facilities for 3D scanning, modeling, and printing, tissue culture and cell sorting, ultracentrifugation, a large environmental chamber, and physiology and molecular biology research.\u00a0\nThe Department of Geological Sciences is constructing a new experimental petrology lab for studying changes that take place in rocks at high pressure, and is developing the capability to use drones and photogrammetry software to make detailed observations of the Earth\u2019s surface to study faults, landslides and other features.\u00a0 The Department of Computer Science and Engineering operates a multi-million dollar computer facility of more than 120 engineering workstations on the world-wide Internet and also houses two supercomputers and fileservers supporting more than 50 gigabytes of secondary storage for application software and user directories. \u00a0\u00a0\nMuch of this equipment and support facilities were obtained not only through the university and as gifts, but also as major grants from the National Science Foundation and other external agencies, awarded to many of our outstanding faculty. We look forward to continuing our quest to update major equipment and facilities in support of both our teaching mission and to promote student and faculty research efforts in an increasingly technology-dependent society.\nThe fundraising effort includes raising private funds to build a strong endowment to support future generations of scholars and students. Increased private support will enhance the already high-quality student body and help recruit faculty members whose teaching and research abilities distinguish them as excellent scholars. This support will build state-of-the-art facilities and renovate or refurbish current facilities to ensure that CNS students and faculty learn and work with cutting-edge technology and resources. The campaign will help the College of Natural Sciences achieve its strategic priorities and secure its status as a preeminent institution, recognized nationally and internationally for excellence in education, research and public service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight Content\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty Jobs\nGive to CNS\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege of Natural Sciences - Office of the Dean\n\n\n\nPhone Number (909) 537-5300 \n\n\n\nLocation:BI-107\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\n\nMonday - Friday: \n 8:00 am - 5:00 pm\n\n\n\n\nSaturday - Sunday: \n Closed\n\n\n\n\n\n(Summer Schedule: Monday - Thursday 7:00 am - 5:30 pm)\nSchedule an Advising Appointment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Region\n\n\n\nCSUSB\n\n\nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino\n5500 University Parkway\nSan Bernardino, CA 92407\n+1 (909) 537-5000\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Social Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso of InterestCollege of Social & Behavioral SciencesDegrees & ProgramsNatural Phenomena \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1 \n\n\n\n\nLogin\n\n\n\n\nmyCoyote\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\nStudent Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB  \nDrupal Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Interest to...\n\n\n\n\nFuture Students\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Students\n   Interests\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nFull-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nPart-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & Visitors\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nAlumni & Friends\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Partners\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nMilitary/Veterans\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 2 \n\n\n\n\nEmployment\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB \nJob Listings\n - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nFaculty Jobs\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nCareer Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHuman Resources\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Employment\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nContact\n  CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nClery Act\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Safety Reports\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTitle IX Notice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure of Consumer Information\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 3 \n\n\n\n\nCampus Services\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Advising\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHousing & Residential Life\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nOmbuds Services\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nParking\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPolice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPsychological Counseling\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nServices to Students with Disabilities\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Health Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Support\n\n\n\n\nTranscripts\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\n\n\n\nNon-Discrimination Notice\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Copyright/DMCA Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
