All loans need to be paid back. When you pay back a loan, your repayment amount includes the full amount you borrowed, plus interest (the amount your lender charges you for borrowing the money).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho\u2019s eligible for student loans?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are student loans available for students in undergraduate, graduate, certificate, dental, medical, and health professions programs. Sallie Mae also offers student loans for graduates studying for the bar exam or relocating for medical and dental residencies.\u00a0\nPrivate student loans\u2014offered by banks like Sallie Mae, credit unions, and other financial institutions\u2014are based on your creditworthiness. This means your lender will check to see if you have a history of borrowing money and paying it back on time. Since many students haven\u2019t had time to build up their own credit, applying for a private student loan with a cosigner\u2014a parent, relative, or other adult with good credit\u2014may increase your chances for approval and help get you a better rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much can you get in private student loans?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour lender will look at your credit profile (and your cosigner\u2019s) to decide how much you can borrow. You may be approved to borrow up to 100% of your school-certified costs for the entire year, if needed.\nYou should borrow only what you can afford to pay back later. Consider how much you may earn in your future career.\u00a0 To help estimate your future income potential, you can visit the US Department of Labor at\u00a0bls.gov.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you apply for a private student loan?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can fill out a student loan application right on the lender\u2019s website. There\u2019s no cost to apply. You\u2019ll be asked to enter some basic personal and financial information, and choose the type of interest rate and repayment plan you want for your loan. If you\u2019re applying with a cosigner, they\u2019ll also need to provide their financial info.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can student loans be used for?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use student loan funds to cover any of your school costs for the year, which might include the following for students attending school at least half time:\n\n\nTuition\nFees\nBooks\nHousing\nMeals\nTravel to and from school\nA laptop\nEquipment, supplies, and tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow long do you have to pay off private student loans?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost lenders offer repayment terms of 5\u201320 years. Because more interest gets added to your loan balance over time, you may be able to save money by paying off your loan sooner.\nUse our Accrued Interest Calculator to see how much you can save by paying more towards your loan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes applying for private student loans affect my credit score?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, it may. Your lender will need to run a credit check to see if you qualify for the college loan, which may impact your credit score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of a cosigner?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may boost your chances of being approved by adding a cosigner (such as a parent, relative, or other responsible adult). Last year, 87% of Sallie Mae undergraduate loans were cosigned.footnote 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a fixed and variable rate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fixed rate is one that doesn\u2019t change over the life of your loan, so your monthly payment stays the same. A variable rate can go up or down with the market, increasing or lowering your monthly payment as it does.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIlluminating your path to higher education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand student loans and borrowing \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the student loan repayment calculator \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the College Planning CalculatorSM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfootnote Borrow responsibly\nWe encourage students and families to start with savings, grants, scholarships, and federal student loans to pay for college. Students and families should evaluate all anticipated monthly loan payments, and how much the student expects to earn in the future, before considering a private student loan.footnote Undergraduate and Graduate School loans are for students at participating degree-granting schools. Career training student loans are for students at participating non-degree-granting schools. Smart Option Student Loan information is for undergraduates only. Graduate Certificate/Continuing Education coursework is not eligible for MBA, Medical, Dental, and Law School Loans. Students who are not U.S. citizens or U.S. permanent residents must reside in the U.S., attend a participating school in the U.S., apply with a creditworthy cosigner (who must be a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident) and provide an unexpired government-issued photo ID to verify their identity. Applications are subject to a requested minimum loan amount of $1,000. Current credit and other eligibility criteria apply.footnote 1. Advertised APRs for undergraduate students assume a $10,000 loan to a student who attends school for 4 years and has no prior Sallie Mae-serviced loans. Interest rates for variable rate loans may increase or decrease over the life of the loan based on changes to the 30-day Average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of one percent.\u00a0 Advertised variable rates are the starting range of rates and may vary outside of that range over the life of the loan. Interest is charged starting when funds are sent to the school. With the Fixed and Deferred Repayment Options, the interest rate is higher than with the Interest Repayment Option and Unpaid Interest is added to the loan\u2019s Current Principal at the end of the grace/separation period. To receive a 0.25 percentage point interest rate discount, the borrower or cosigner must enroll in auto debit through Sallie Mae. The discount applies only during active repayment for as long as the Current Amount Due or Designated Amount is successfully withdrawn from the authorized bank account each month. It may be suspended during forbearance or deferment.footnote 2. Advertised APRs for career training students assume a $10,000 loan to a student who attends school for 2 years and has no prior Sallie Mae-serviced loans. Interest rates for variable rate loans may increase or decrease over the life of the loan based on changes to the 30-day Average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of one percent.\u00a0 Advertised variable rates are the starting range of rates and may vary outside of that range over the life of the loan.

Based on a comparison of approval rates for Sallie Mae\u00a0student loan borrowers who applied with a cosigner versus without a cosigner from October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022.footnote 4. Based on a rolling 12-month period from\u00a0October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022.footnote 5. For applications submitted directly to Sallie Mae, loan amount cannot exceed the cost of attendance less financial aid received, as certified by the school. Applications submitted to Sallie Mae through a partner website may be subjected to a lower maximum loan request amount. Miscellaneous personal expenses (such as a laptop) may be included in the cost of attendance for students enrolled at least half-time.footnote 6. Sallie Mae loans cover enrollment periods of up to 12 months. Students must apply for a new loan each school year. This approval percentage is based on students who were approved for a Sallie Mae undergraduate loan with a cosigner in the 2020/21 school year and were approved for another Sallie Mae undergraduate loan when they returned\u00a0 with the same or new cosigner in 2021/22. It does not include the denied applications of students who were ultimately approved in 2021/22.footnote 7. Borrowers and cosigners with an available FICO\u00ae\u00a0Score and a Sallie Mae-serviced loan with a current balance greater than $0, may receive their score quarterly after the first loan disbursement. The FICO\u00ae\u00a0Score provided to you is the FICO\u00ae\u00a0Score 8 based on TransUnion data.

The Graduated Repayment Period (GRP) allows interest-only payments for 12 billing periods after principal and interest repayment begins. At the time of the GRP request, the loan cannot be past due. Customers can request the GRP during the six billing periods before and the 12 billing periods immediately after the loan first enters principal and interest repayment. The GRP does not extend the loan term but does increase the Total Loan Cost. Monthly payments after the GRP will be higher than they would have been without it.footnote Sallie Mae loans are made by Sallie Mae Bank.footnote Information advertised valid as of 4/25/2023.footnote SALLIE MAE RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND BENEFITS AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE.\u00a0CHECK\u00a0SALLIEMAE.COM\u00a0FOR THE MOST UP-TO-DATE PRODUCT INFORMATION.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent loans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout us\n\n\nCareers\n\n\nFor investors\n\n\n\n\nMedia\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nLeading research\n\n\nContests\n\n\nBenefits Transparency\n\n\n\n\nCosigner responsibilities\n\n\nBecome a school partner\n\n\nPartner resources\n\n\nMilitary resources\n\n\nBeware of debt relief offers\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\nSitemap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms of use\n\n\nProtect your privacy\n\n\nAvoid online fraud\n\n\nAccessibility statement\n\n\nSocial media guidelines\n\n\nDo not sell or share my personal information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2023 Sallie Mae Bank.
