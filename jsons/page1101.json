Travelers who are experiencing symptoms of illness should mask until receiving a negative rapid COVID test on day 5.\u00a0\nStudents planning travel or returning to campus should review the Student Affairs Travel & Return Testing Guide.\nHealth Advisories: The CDC has issued a\u00a0Level 2 Alert\u00a0regarding\u00a0Ebola\u00a0in Uganda. Additionally, the CDC maintains a\u00a0Level 1 Watch\u00a0for Mpox (formerly Monkeypox) in multiple countries.\nPlease note: Reimbursement for any mandatory quarantine expenses associated with university-sponsored travel is the responsibility of the sending unit or department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT STATUS\nFaculty, staff, postdocs, and graduate students are permitted to travel both domestically and internationally without requesting an exception. Field research involving human subjects no longer requires prior approval.\nStanford-sponsored international trips may require pre-travel COVID testing and/or COVID testing during the program.\u00a0\nTravelers on group trips should carry KN95 masks in the event that a group member tests positive/has symptoms for COVID-19 or the COVID situation in their destination country changes.\nWith limited\u00a0exceptions, travel for undergraduate students is not permitted to countries, regions or cities where the International SOS\u00a0 travel or medical risk rating is \u201cHigh\u201d or \u201cExtreme.\u201d To determine a location\u2019s International SOS medical and travel risk ratings, please visit\u00a0this page.\nALL TRAVEL: As noted above, all campus units that fund or sponsor travel for business, research, study abroad and experiential learning opportunities must be prepared to fund and support any mandatory quarantines associated with university-sponsored travel. All undergraduate travel requires a plan for participants that become COVID positive and need to isolate in place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRAVEL BOOKING ADVICE\n\n\nTravelers are strongly advised to verify travel entry requirements through the Centers for Disease Control and the country of destination.\nStudents, faculty, staff, and postdoctoral scholars booking air fare for\u00a0university-sponsored travel\u00a0must utilize a\u00a0Stanford Travel booking channel\u00a0in order to ensure reimbursement.\u00a0\nTravelers\u00a0now\u00a0have the option\u00a0of\u00a0booking\u00a0hotels\u00a0outside of the\u00a0Stanford Travel\u00a0program and instead use the\u00a0itinerary-forwarding service. Since booking a hotel through Stanford Travel affords some\u00a0safety benefits and administrative efficiencies, Stanford Travel remains the preferred option. Regardless of the mode of booking hotels, travelers must continue to adhere to Stanford\u2019s\u00a0lodging policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL TRAVEL ASSISTANCE\nTravelers may benefit from global travel risk assessments and mitigation recommendations. This service is available through the Global Risk office (globalrisk@stanford.edu) and is particularly useful for:\n(1) Travel to higher-risk destinations (based on information from the U.S. Department of State, Centers for Disease Control, International SOS or other reliable sources of information for health, safety or security risks),\n(2) Group trips that include five or more travelers, and,\n(3) Travelers with particular vulnerabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford\n\n \nInternational Affairs\n\n\n\n\n\nAddress\n\n450 Jane Stanford Way\nWallenberg Hall, Building 160, Suite 239\nStanford, CA 94305\nUnited States\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanfordUniversity\n\n\n\n\nStanford Home(link is external)\n\nMaps & Directions(link is external)\n\nSearch Stanford(link is external)\n\nEmergency Info(link is external)\n\n\n\nTerms of Use(link is external)\n\nPrivacy(link is external)\n\nCopyright(link is external)\n\nTrademarks(link is external)\n\nNon-Discrimination(link is external)\n\nAccessibility(link is external)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University.\n\u00a0 Stanford, California 94305.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Back to Top\n\n\n\n\n",
