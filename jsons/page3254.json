Jerry Brown also spurred Californians to develop better water-saving habits, such as irrigating their lawns and gardens during cooler morning hours when less water is lost to evaporation, the researchers found. The study analyzed about half a billion records of hourly water use data.\nMost of the permanent water savings came from higher-end water users, who get a greater return from investments in water efficiency.\n\u201cThe higher-end water users tend to be wealthier and have larger\n\n \n\nMehdi Nemati\n\n\nlots,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Mehdi Nemati, assistant professor of water resources economics in UCR\u2019s School of Public Policy. \u201cThey adopted technology in some way or another, and their rebound in water use was much smaller than lower-end use.\u201d\nLower-end water users \u2014 people with less income and smaller yards \u2014 tended to let their lawns go brown during the period of the water-cut mandates. So, when the mandate was lifted, these users resumed watering their lawns, contributing to a 13-15% increase in water use compared to the mandate period \u2014 but water use was still lower in 2019 than in 2013.\nThe data provide new insights into Gov. Brown\u2019s controversial executive order in 2015 that required state water providers to slash the state\u2019s urban water use by 25% following three years of worsening drought. To achieve this goal, the individual urban water providers, such as city utilities and water districts, had to reduce water consumption by 4% to 36%, depending upon what water conservation measures each entity already had in place. Brown\u2019s mandate was in effect from June 2015 to May 2016.\nThe UCR researchers focused on granular data from a water utility in Northern California that serves about 70,000 people and were able to extrapolate the trends to the entire state with data from an ongoing statewide study, Nemati said.\nThe Northern California utility was required to slash its water deliveries by 32%. To do so, it offered rebates to replace grass lawns with drought-tolerant landscapes, upgrade irrigation systems, and for residences and businesses to install more water-efficient toilets and washing machines, among other water conversation measures.\nSignificantly, the utility also banned watering between the hours of 10 a.m. and 10 p.m., when higher temperatures outdoors increase the loss of irrigation water from evaporation.\n\u201cConsistent with best water-use practices, people moved to earlier watering hours, and continued to do so after the mandate was lifted,\u201d Nemati said. \u201cThat was one of the findings with the hourly water usage data.\u201d\nNemati cautioned that it would be more difficult in the future to achieve water-use reductions because so many higher-end water users have already invested in water efficiency.\n\u201cIt is useful for the water agencies to know that we already got rid of most of our low-hanging fruit,\u201d he said.\nThe study, \u201cResidential Water Conservation and the Rebound Effect: A Temporal Decomposition,\u201d was co-authored by Dat Tran, a former postdoctoral scholar in UCR\u2019s School of Public Policy, who is now an economist at the Office of Economic and Demographic Research in Florida, and Kurt Schwabe, an associate dean and professor of environmental economics and policy in the School of Public Policy.\n\u00a0\nCover photo: Low water at Lake Success near East Porterville, Calif., in 2015, the year water-use cuts were imposed by Gov.
