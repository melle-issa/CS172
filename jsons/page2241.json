This is achieved through mental health counseling, advocacy, and outreach and consultation in a safe, supportive and culturally-informed environment.\nLocation\nCAPS\u00a0is located in the Health Center Building, north of the The Meeting Center\u00a0and East of the SMSU Expansion Site. Entrance to Counseling and Psychological Services is on the West side \u2013 facing the SMSU Expansion Site and north of the main Health Center entrance.\u00a0On the campus map\u00a0our building is identified as HC (Health Center).\nElgibility\nElgibility will be confirmed before your first appointment.\n\nAll currently enrolled students who have paid the Student Health & Psychological Counseling Center Program and Facilities Fee are eligible for services.\nStudents who are currently enrolled in continuing education/extension are eligible for services if the program collects, and the student has paid, the Student Health & Psychological Counseling Center Program and Facilities Fee.\nStudents who are enrolled in Open University courses are not eligible for services.\n\nIf you're curious if counseling is right for you, take this anonymous mental health questionnaire:\nCSUSB CAPS Mental Health Screening\n\n\n\n\nCommon Concerns and Issues Discussed\n\nConfusion, anxiety, or depression\nMood variability\nNeeding help with an important decision\nLoneliness\nAdjusting to living away from parents\nFriendship problems\nRomantic concerns\nFamily concerns-including parental divorce\nCompulsive eating\nSelf-destructive use of alcohol or drugs\nLoss of a relationship\nBalancing academics and social needs\nShyness\nIllness or death of a friend or family member\nPersonal trauma such as sexual assault\n\nAppointments\nStudents can call CAPS at (909) 537-5040 to schedule an appointment; CAPS is unable to schedule appointments via a third person.\nFor individual and couples therapy, a\u00a0short-term model is utilized.\u00a0Some students have needs not best served by CAPS and may be referred to other services on campus or in the community.\u00a0\nCost\nCounseling and Psychological Services is funded by the student health fee paid at the time of enrollment to CSUSB. No other fees apply. \u00a0\nConfidentiality and Privacy\nAll contacts with Counseling and Psychological Services are confidential, except in situations where legal or ethical considerations require notification of a family member or others.\u00a0Notice of Privacy Practices.\u00a0\n\nCounseling and Psychological Services does not release any information regarding whether a student has used the service nor matters discussed in counseling. Except under certain specific circumstances, no parent, dean, faculty member, or other student can gain access to information about a client without express written permission.\nExceptions:\n\nA student who has used CAPS services may give authorization to release records or to disclose information to anyone the student chooses. However, a request to exchange confidential information must first be completed and signed.\nIf the counselor believes that there is danger to self or others, safety considerations will prevail, and the counselor will notify appropriate family members or other authority. Such disclosure is for the purpose of providing the necessary care and protection of the student.\nIn very rare circumstances, the court may order the release of confidential information.\nUnlicensed counselors work under the supervision of a licensed counselor who has access to counseling records in order to perform supervision responsibilities. In addition, a student may grant permission for a counselor to audiotape or videotape a session for the counselor to review with his/her supervisor.\nCounselors are mandated reporters of suspected elder or child abuse and must notify the appropriate agencies.\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n May 2\n\n\nWounds de La Familia: Understanding and Healing From Intergenerational Trauma \n\n 12:00pm - 1:00pm\n In-Person: Room SB-306 (Social and Behavioral Sciences Building) live broadcast via Zoom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n May 3\n\n\nNarcan 101\n\n 11:00am - 12:00pm\n Zoom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n May 10\n\n\nMental Health Awareness Panel \n\n 12:00pm - 1:30pm\n Zoom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight Content\n\n\n\nCoyote Connection\nEmergencies and After Hours\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services\n\n\n\nPhone Number (909) 537-5040 \n\n\n\nLocation:HC-162\n\n\nOffice Hours\nMonday - Thursday: \n8:00 am - 5:00 pm\n\u00a0\nFriday:\n9:30 am - 5:00 pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media\n\n\n\nCounseling and Psychological Services Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRed Folder \u2013 Assisting Students in Distress\nCARE Team\nPDC Health and Psychological Counseling Center\nStudent Health Center\u00a0- San Bernardino Campus\nSurvivor Advocacy Services\nTitle IX Office\nUniversity Police\nOff-Campus Counseling Services\nCommunity Resources\nResources for Student Veterans\nSexual Assault\nServices to Students with Disabilities (SSD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Region\n\n\n\nCSUSB\n\n\nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino\n5500 University Parkway\nSan Bernardino, CA 92407\n+1 (909) 537-5000\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's YouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's LinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n CSUSB's Social Media\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso of InterestCommunity Low-fee Counseling ServicesCommunity Counseling CenterHealth and Wellness Workshop Library \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1 \n\n\n\n\nLogin\n\n\n\n\nmyCoyote\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\nStudent Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff Email\n  Login\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB  \nDrupal Login\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf Interest to...\n\n\n\n\nFuture Students\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Students\n   Interests\n\n\n\n\nFaculty & Staff\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nFull-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nPart-Time Faculty\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nCommunity & Visitors\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nAlumni & Friends\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Partners\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\nMilitary/Veterans\n  Interests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 2 \n\n\n\n\nEmployment\n\n\n\n\nCSUSB \nJob Listings\n - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nFaculty Jobs\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nCareer Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHuman Resources\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Employment\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nContact\n  CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nClery Act\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Safety Reports\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTitle IX Notice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure of Consumer Information\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 3 \n\n\n\n\nCampus Services\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Advising\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nHousing & Residential Life\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nOmbuds Services\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nParking\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPolice\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nPsychological Counseling\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nServices to Students with Disabilities\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nStudent Health Center\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Support\n\n\n\n\nTranscripts\n  - CSUSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Security\n\n\n\n\nNon-Discrimination Notice\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Copyright/DMCA Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
