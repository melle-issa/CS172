But why not also have some fun while learning about what you love?\n\nAs we build on the School's bright past, we invite you to join us in creating a brilliant future.\n            \n\n\n\nRead our Humanities Case Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Global Cultural & Historical Studies\n            \n\n\n\n        UCI humanities is a gateway to the world, past, present and future. UCI humanists study culture, language, history and creative expression around the globe.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Languages, Literature and Media\n            \n\n\n\n        Through literary and media analysis, translation, documentary practice and storytelling, humanists at UCI investigate the ways human beings have symbolized their experiences and shared them with others. Examining ancient stone inscriptions and classic orators to texts, mainstream films and social media, humanists at UCI help us understand the voices of the past, present and future.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Human Dimensions of Science and Technology\n            \n\n\n\n        Humanists at UCI illuminate the human dimensions of science, technology and the environment. We examine the changes that the sciences and technology have brought to our species, including the ways we have imagined and represented these changes through philosophy, literature, and visual art. \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Philosophy and Critical Theory\n            \n\n\n\n        Humanists at UCI explore and challenge what humans think and know. Philosophy and theory help us ask questions about ourselves, what we take for granted, and the distinctions between truth, falsity and error.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n        Humanities: It's Time\n            \n\n\n \n\n        UCI Humanities scholars spotlight pivotal moments in history\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        1915: Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis is published\n            \n\n\n\nSelected by Kai Evers, associate professor of German, Department of European Languages and Studies\nLearn more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        1325: The Jami Mosque of Khambhat, Gujarat is constructed\n            \n\n\n\nSelected by Alka Patel, professor, Department of Art History\nLearn more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        1979: The start of the Salvadoran Revolution\n            \n\n\n\nSelected by H\u00e9ctor Tobar, associate professor, Departments of English and Chicano/Latino studies.\nLearn more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        2018: Winnie Mandela\u2019s life recognized in #WeAreNomzamo & #SheDidNotDie campaigns\n            \n\n\n\nSelected by Tiffany Willoughby-Herard, associate professor, Department of African American Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        1849: First Chinese restaurants opened in San Francisco\n            \n\n\n\nSelected by Yong Chen, professor, Department of History\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        News\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n        Learn about the humanities faculty, students, alumni and community members who are making an impact\n            \n\n\n\nSubscribe for News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe slow burn\n\n\n\n          UCI poetry professor\u2019s new book explores identity and belonging in verse\n      \n\nRead Full Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCultivating excellence in Armenian studies\n\n\n\n          Diran and Seta Apelian make important first donation to $1.5 million Armenian Studies Endowment\n      \n\nRead Full Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCI Professor Jane O.
