I have made the difficult decision to discontinue the development and support of Kirki.\nWhen I first acquired Kirki in early 2020, I had big plans for it. Although we were able to execute on step one of the 2-step plan we had for the plugin, as time went on, I lost passion for the project mainly due to the direction WordPress core has taken with Gutenberg.\n It\u2019s clear to me now that I was too ambitious in taking on the project.\nKirki is now for sale\nWith that said, I am now looking for someone to adopt the Kirki plugin. The current active install count in the WordPress repository is 600,000, which presents a great opportunity to revamp the plugin and get it in front of actual users. I believe that there\u2019s still great potential in Kirki, and I\u2019m looking for someone who shares that vision to take it forward.\nThe plugin is for sale for $30,000, and that number is slightly negotiable.\nThis of course includes all assets such as the website, GitHub, PRO Extensions, etc.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that no further updates are planned for Kirki core, nor the paid extensions. While the paid extensions remain for sale on the website, no updates are expected.\nIf you\u2019re interested in adopting the plugin, please reach out here.\nIt\u2019s important to me that Kirki gets into the right hands. I hope that someone can take on the project that sees the opportunity and gives Kirki the attention & love that it deserves.\nWe understand that this news may be disappointing for our loyal Kirki users. We want to thank you for your support over the years. It\u2019s been an honor to serve you, and we\u2019re grateful for the time we had to work on the plugin.\nLimited support & updates\nWhile we will no longer be actively developing or updating the Kirki plugin, we will continue to provide limited support to our users. This includes fixing critical bugs and addressing incompatibility issues that may arise from WordPress core updates.\nAgain, thank you for your support. We wish you all the best.\nBest regards,David\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
