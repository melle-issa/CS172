    "body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatershed Review\nEst. 2012\n\n\n\n\nMenu\n\nSkip to content\n\nHomeAbout This Blog\nHistory\nSubmit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMonthly Archives: November 2016 \n\n\n\nWriter\u2019s Voice Spotlight: Robert\u00a0Krut \n\n\nI recently had the pleasure of reading Robert Krut\u2019s poetry for the first time. The experience was both enlightening and inspiring. Krut\u2019s writing conveys feelings that are familiar and yet somehow indiscernible. Images speak, melting into emotions that cannot be articulated, kindling the smolder of latent imagination.\nJust one of the many themes present in Krut\u2019s poetry I found particularly fascinating was the supernatural elements, and I found myself spellbound by his use of imagery. There were moments of surprise in Krut\u2019s poetry in which I had to stop and ask myself \u201cDid this seemingly regular imagery really just take that turn?\u201d\nHere are five of my favorites:\n\u201cGargoyle\u201d and \u201cYou are a Jellyfish, Ghost,\u201d\u00a0(Packingtown Review)\n\u201cHold Me, the Walls are Falling,\u201d\u00a0(Vinyl Poetry, with an accompanying video)\n\u201cHeart Holds Lake,\u201d (A Dozen Nothing)\n\u201cPhantasmagoria at Six AM,\u201d (Night Block)\nIn preparation for his upcoming visit, I was lucky enough to ask Robert Krut about his writing process and creative life:\nWhat kind of creative patterns, routines, or rituals do you have?\nI just try to write whenever a phrase or image jumps out at me\u2014sometimes that happens at a time when I can type it right out, sometimes it is written into a bedside notebook, sometimes it means recording cryptic words into my phone. Then, later I can pull them all together for the actual writing. In terms of routine, that changes up periodically\u2014for a while I will only write at the crack of dawn, which will prove to be very productive. Then, I\u2019ll mix it up and write at the end of the day, when my inhibitions are down a bit. The key, as everyone will say, is to try to write every day whether it is crafting a full-blown draft or even just a few lines.\nI will say the most productive I am is when I have a schedule to stick to\u2014and why I don\u2019t manage to always stick to it is a great mystery of either a busy life or laziness\u2014but when I do, I write a lot more. Wake up, write for a while before coffee in the morning. That helps. When I\u2019ve given myself a strict regimen, I always wind up with workable material in the long run.\nThis year you were A Dozen Nothing\u2019s selected poet for March. One of the poems published in that issue was\u00a0Bomb the Subtext. What about this poem is special to you or led you to write it?\nI had been working on a long, long\u2014ridiculously long\u2014poem, designed to be something of an epic piece (in my mind) of interlocking sections with a driving narrative. But the farther I got into it, even mapping out the trajectory of a plot and setting details, it felt less like poetry to me and more like something else. And not something I thought was heading in a particularly interesting direction\u2014it had started with a burst of excitement, but by the end point, it felt stale. So I scrapped the whole plan, and then just tried writing a few poems that would be moments in what had been my initially exciting world for the piece. About four short poems made it out of that process\u2014\u201cBomb the Subtext\u201d was one of them. My hope is that those remaining poems evoke the larger \u201cstory\u201d or \u201cthemes\u201d or whatever else it might be called better than where the longer piece was headed.\nIn terms of what makes it special, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything special about the poem itself, but I am glad that it appeared in A Dozen Nothing, which is such a great new journal. Pete Miller and Jeff Sirkin\u2014both incredible poets themselves\u2014are really onto something there, and I was thrilled to be a part of it.\nWhat was your biggest mistake as a writer?\nWhen I was younger (not to jump the gun on your next question), it was thinking that I had to pick one particular style or approach and stick with it, which can shut you off to trying new things. I write like this, and not like that, or (worse), this is the way it should be done, etc. That lets you get boring very quickly.\nThese days, if I\u2019m not reading as much as a I want\u2014as much as I should\u2014I feel that mistake in both my daily life and, of course, my writing.\nIf you could go back in time, what would you tell your younger writer self?\nTalk half as much, and listen twice as much.\nWhat is a measure of success for a poet?\nI\u2019m not sure how to define success, really, but personally I feel (temporary) satisfaction when I\u2019ve been editing and revising a draft of a poem for a while and then get to the point where I feel safe enough to walk away from it. As I just wrote that sentence, I was reminded of one of your Chico State alumni, in fact\u2014Raymond Carver\u2014who wrote about a similar feeling in his piece \u201cOn Writing.\u201d I read that essay religiously when I was younger, and it clearly stuck. There is always a little blink of time after letting the poem set in place that feels rewarding, and then you get back to work.\n______________________________\nRobert Krut is the author of\u00a0This is the Ocean\u00a0(Bona Fide Books, 2013),which received the Melissa Lanitis Gregory Poetry Award, as well as\u00a0The Spider Sermons\u00a0(BlazeVox, 2009).\u00a0His work has appeared widely in print and online, in journals like\u00a0Cimarron Review,\u00a0Blackbird,\u00a0Smartish Pace,\u00a0and more.\u00a0In 2007,\u00a0H_NGM_N\u00a0released his chapbook\u00a0Theory of the Walking Big Bang;\u00a0subsequently, he began serving on the press/journal\u2019s Editorial Board.\u00a0He teaches at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and lives in Los Angeles.\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Robert Krut, Tuesday, November 29th at 7:30 pm in Colusa 100A.
