Fisher describes the inspiration for his research projects using soil-moisture readings and other data, reflecting a process that has helped the scientist become one of the most cited researchers in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow his latest unique exploratory project has yielded results Fisher says \u201ccould be a gamechanger for global food security.\u201d\nGoing forward, the scientific advance may allow nations, the UN and humanitarian aid organizations to more efficiently direct resources to areas of drought and famine before those regions tip into full-blown crisis.\n\u201cDo you know what this means?\u201d Fisher recalls saying to his former student and lead author Krishna Krishnamurthy at the moment the two realized their model had achieved its predictive potential. \u201cWe can now predict 100% of food crashes and recoveries three to six months ahead of time. This is going to save lives.\u201d\nExisting predictive systems fail to anticipate many crises, resulting in loss of lives and resources, the researchers said. Droughts are the source of two-thirds of those misses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying Tipping Point Theory to Food Security\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers\u2019 model is called SMART, for Soil Moisture Auto-Regressive Threshold. They achieved their key breakthrough by applying a tool of climate change science called Tipping Point Theory to clarify satellite data that measures the moisture content of soil. Other factors are represented in the model as well, including the price of grain, but they are ancillary contributors, Fisher said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can now predict 100% of food crashes and recoveries three to six months ahead of time. This is going to save lives.\u201d\n\u00a0Joshua B. Fisher, Chapman\nUniversity Presidential Fellow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipping Point Theory is used to identify when dynamic systems experience incremental change that tips them into another state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe project really took off when we found that Tipping Point Theory can be applied to food security,\u201d said Fisher, who, in addition to Krishnamurthy, is joined by Richard J. Choularton and Peter M. Kareiva as co-authors on the paper.\nTipping Point Theory is used to identify when dynamic systems experience incremental change that tips them into another state.\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually applied to really big climatic things. Like that the Sahara Desert once was all vegetated and now it\u2019s not, or there were huge amounts of Arctic ice and now there aren\u2019t,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cExcept in this case, we\u2019re able to predict a recovery, which won\u2019t be happening in the Sahara.\u201d\nThe other key component of the model is data from a NASA satellite mission called Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), which has been providing soil moisture information since 2015. Food security crises identified by SMAP and plotted on the team\u2019s research dashboard range from Guatemala to Ethiopia, Cambodia to Mozambique.\n\u201cWe analyzed drought-induced food crises globally in the SMAP record \u2013 about five per year,\u201d the researchers say in their paper, titled \u201cAnticipating Drought-Related Food Security Changes.\u201d\n\u201cThe change in soil moisture autocorrelation \u2026 signaled an accurate food security transition for all cases studied, including lead time of up to three to six months for every case. The SMART trigger anticipates the timing of the transition and the magnitude of the food security change among small to large transitions, both into and out of crises.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chance to mentor students throughout novel research explorations helped attract Earth systems scientist Joshua B. Fisher to Chapman, where he\u2019s aided by students such as Radhika Puri \u201825 and Ben Jensen \u201824.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cResults like these drive you,\u201d says Fisher, here meeting with students at the Orange Home Grown Education Farm near the Chapman campus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUncertainty can affect humanitarian response\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReliable early-warning data are a driver of funding for humanitarian response to food security crises, said Krishnamurthy, who works for the UN World Food Programme as an anticipatory action and planning coordinator.\n\u201cDonors don\u2019t always want to invest in a setting of uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we can show that we\u2019re getting really high levels of accuracy in our model, that will improve the confidence in the data and in the recommendation to act. Investing in early action and not just after the fact is critical.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\u201cInvesting in early action and not just after the fact is critical.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nIt takes about four to eight weeks to mount an emergency response to a food security crisis, Krishnamurthy said. So the chance to prepare for a famine three to six months in advance rather than reacting as many as eight weeks after systems have tipped into crisis is an exciting prospect, the researchers said.\nSince their paper was published, they have received outreach from a number of actors who support humanitarian interventions, including the World Bank, \u201cwhich is quite encouraging,\u201d Fisher said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFisher\u2019s ongoing research projects feature substantive roles for Chapman students, including (from left) Holland Hatch \u201825, Kristiene Jumig \u201823, Ben Jensen \u201824, Zo\u00eb von Allmen \u201823 and Radhika Puri \u201825.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne next step for the food security predictive model will be finding a way to more effectively account for the influence of conflict and regime change in a region.\n\u201cOur model doesn\u2019t do a good job of predicting wars \u2013 at least not yet,\u201d Fisher said.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that there have been many ups and downs during the five-year history of the project, which began when Fisher was a scientist at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Krishnamurthy was his doctoral student. They continued their investigations from when both were at Oxford University, and the project has now reached new heights since Fisher joined Chapman in 2021.\nThe chance to mentor students throughout novel research explorations is a key factor that attracted Fisher to Chapman and its teacher-scholar model.\n\u201cResults like these drive you,\u201d said Fisher, who ranks in the top 1% of scholars for his citations, according to scientific research service Clarivate. That puts him on a list with 24 Nobel laureates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you get results that give you insight into how the world works, it\u2019s such a rush,\u201d he added. \u201cMoments like this keep everything moving forward.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency \n\nMedia ContactsCerise Valenzuela Metzger\n\nDirector of Public Relations\n(714) 289-3143 (office)\n(657) 390-6760  (cell)\ncmetzger@chapman.edu\n\nOffice of Public Relations\n\nPR@chapman.edu \n\nNewsroom SiteChapman Magazine\n\nChapman Forward\nCOVID-19 Resources\n\nChapman Site\nVisit Chapman\nView Tuition and Aid\nApply Now\nEmployment \n\nServices & PoliciesAccessibility Feedback \nWebsite Feedback \nDisability Services \nDirectory Emergency \nConsumer Disclosures \nPrivacy Policy Title IX \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2023\u00a0Chapman University           \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nAlumni\nArts & Film\nBusiness & Economy\nCampus & Students\nCollege Knowledge\nCommunity\nCOVID-19\nHealth & Behavior\nHumanities & Society\nScience & Engineering\nUniversity News\n\n\nOur Voices\nCOVID-19 Resources\nMagazines\n\nChapman Magazine\nChapman Forward\n\n\nPress Room\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
