It\u2019s the school\u2019s highest-ever position in rankings of business schools with full-time MBA programs.\nAgryros School jumped up from No. 72 last year, its second-highest ranking.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge achievement for our school, and for our students and professors and alumni,\u201d said Dean Henrik Cronqvist.\nThe U.S. News ranking of schools with full-time MBA programs is based on a range of indicators, including career placement success and earnings, student excellence and qualitative assessments by experts.\nHalf the formula ranks institutions on placement and earnings of graduates. The other half factors in achievements of entering students and opinions by business schools, corporate recruiters and company contacts on program quality, according to U.S. News.\nOne of Chapman\u2019s long-term goals in its new strategic plan is a top 50 ranking for the business school.\u00a0\nThat goal is part of the university\u2019s priority to continue rises in national rankings, with a focus on measures of academic achievement, financial resources and graduation/retention rates.\nUnder previous dean Thomas Turk, Argyros School rose more than 25 places in the rankings overall over five years.\n\u201cYear after year, we\u2019ve attracted more students, more applications, and gained a little bit more prominence. People are optimistic, excited about the future because they\u2019ve seen how much progress you can make,\u201d Turk said in June 2022.\nThe new Best Business Schools list ranked 148 business schools. Chapman ranked behind just six schools in California.\nChapman\u2019s full-time MBA program was established in 2005.\n\n\nArgyros School Argyros School of Business and Economics best business schools Full Time MBA graduate programs MBA MBA programs U.S. News & World Report U.S. News & World Report college rankings U.S. News ranking \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJoy Juedes \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPA Program Breaks Top 100 in First US News Ranking\n\n\n\n\n\nNobel Winner Vernon Smith Honored with First Doti-Spogli Award\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Asia-Pacific Initiative Offers Unique Take on Hotbed Region Growing up in Los Angeles, Robert Koepp became fascinated with Asia.
