Interpersonal violence is about power and control, so it is important for your friend to be empowered to make their own decisions For faculty and staff...Provide support to the student by believing them and not pressuring them to explain details of the abuseMake sure your students know that you are a mandated reporter and let them know about the two confidential resources (Safe Place and Counseling and Wellness Center)\u201cThank you so much for trusting me. I want to let you know that I do have to report this to the Title IX office, but you have control over what you do with that report. They will send a letter to your Wildcat email with resources and information.\u201d\u201cI can imagine how difficult it was to disclose that information. I believe you and appreciate you telling me. I do need to let you know that I must give this information to the Title IX office, and they will be reaching out with a letter of resources and information. You are in control over whether you move forward with reporting or not, but I must report to fulfill my reporting obligations.\u201dReport to Title IX by calling 530-898-4949 and providing any information you recall. You do not need to ask the student for details, names, or further questions.If you are concerned with how to best support the student or struggling with emotions, then you can call or email Safe Place to consult and receive support.Remember that you do not have to be a counselor to provide supportAs a parent...It is natural to want to take control of the situationIt is important to give your child the power to control the situation since they had no power or control when the assault took placeTry not to be upset if it took some time for your child to reach out and tell youQuick ExitVice President for Student AffairsKendall Hall, Room 110530-898-6131www.csuchico.edu/saDivision of Student AffairsAccessibility Resource CenterAssociated StudentsBasic Needs ProjectCareer CenterEquity, Diversity & InclusionEarly Outreach & Support ProgramsEnrollment Management\u00a0ServicesFinancial Aid & ScholarshipsIntercollegiate AthleticsOff-Campus Student ServicesStudent Conduct, Rights & ResponsibilitiesStudent Life & LeadershipUniversity HousingWellCat Services\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus.
