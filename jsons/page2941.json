Its text defaults to \"Details\". Activating or clicking on this element is what expands and closes the content.\nThe content that is hidden and shown depending on if the details is open is inside a <div> below the <summary>. The <div> contains a placeholder paragraph.\n\n Closes 44539\n\nWhy?\nOne use case is to include text transcripts for video blocks, that are visually hidden until requested (toggled/opened).\nHow?\nSome implementation notes:\n\nThe block is open / expanded by default in the editor.\nThe default behavior of opening and closing the details with click, Space end Enter keys is disabled in the editor.\n\nTesting Instructions\nIn the block editor:\n\nCreate a new post or page.\nUse either the block inserter or the shortcut /details  to add the block.\nSelect the Details Summary inner block and add your summary text.\nSelect the Details Content block and add a text in the paragraph or add new blocks.\nNext, please test all the block settings:\n\n\nChange styles of all 3 blocks. When changing the parent, but not the inner blocks, the inner blocks should inherit all the style options from the parent.\nChange block alignment and width settings on the parent block (Details)\nView the front of the website and confirm that the block settings are working and that the block looks correct.\nA block that is closed in the editor should also be closed on the front.\n\nConfirm that the details summary and details content are locked and can not be deleted or moved up or down, and that the block can not have multiple summaries or content blocks.\nPlease also test the global styles:\n\nOpen the Site Editor\nUse either the block inserter or the shortcut /details  to add the block.\nOpen the Styles sidebar.\nLocate and update the style settings on all 3 blocks.\nConfirm that the style is correct in the Site Editor.\nSave and view the front. Confirm that the style is correct.\nReturn to the block editor. Add a new details block and confirm that:\n\n\nThe newly added block uses the global styles\nThe previous block that you have styled uses its individual style, not the global styles.\n\nFinally please reset the global styles in the Site Editor, and test styling the block with theme.json.\nThe styles added to theme.json should show correctly in the editors and the front.\nAccessibility\nEditing the block with they keyboard in the editor\nNavigate to the block.\nWith the block selected, press down arrow to edit the text inside the <summary>\nPress  down arrow again to select the details content \"container\" block.\nPress  down arrow again to select the first block inside the details content.\nScreen readers\nTested with Voiceover on Mac.\nWith the block selected in the block editor, Voiceover announces \"Block details, document\".\nWith the rich text in the summary selected, Voiceover announces:  \"Add summary, edit text (text content), Insertion at end of text. Block details summary, document.\"\nWith the inner block below the summary selected, Voiceover announces the block name.\nScreenshots or screencast \nThe video shows adding inner blocks and styling

If it's a toggle on the experiments page, it provides a bit more room for introducing breaking changes as there's a clear disclaimer on the page.\nThe same process has been used recently for quite a few features, and I think it works really well.\nThe experimental flag in the block.json is a little different. I think it prevents the block being shipped to WordPress core, and I'm not sure if it does more than that.\n\nthe separate blocks were used to enable the styling options.\n\nThanks for clarifying (and also to @fabiankaegy for the earlier clarification). I missed that discussion. I guess this problem isn't solvable any other way right now. Something like contentOnly locking could work well for this block if there were a way to still expose all the design tools.

Comparing it to the Quote block, that has inner blocks for the quote content, but the blockquote and cite elements aren't blocks. Similar might work well here where 'summary' isn't a block, but the content area accepts any inner block.\n\nThat's interesting. Would help alleviate the doubled-up block supports styling bits, as well as improve block selection. Currently you have to manually select the parent Details block to set it as opened for example.\nI'm in favor of this; would simplify experience a good bit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n carolinan\nand others\n        added 4 commits\n        \nMarch 30, 2023 16:11\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMerge branch 'trunk' into add/details-summary-block\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neb47efc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRemove View from save.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n597f6b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nRemove translation from save.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n772a334\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMake the block opt-in, available from the Experiments page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2a3b19b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\ncarolinan\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Mar 31, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor experimental blocks, should the fixtures contain \"name\": \"core/missing\", ?

This allows you to independently change the color / typography / spacing of the summary element and the content. Add a border around the entire element or just the summary etc.\n\nI wouldn't consider that the primary/likely case, though it would still be possible to do most of this while also gaining the benefits of a simpler block experience.
