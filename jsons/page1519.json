It took a midwife, whom I saw postpartum, to explain what happened and to provide support processing my son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birth.\nI was inspired to become a midwife because of the birth stories I heard from friends and my own birth story. One shared thread in these stories was our mistreatment by the medical system. Midwives seemed to be the key to maintaining patient autonomy and respecting labor and birth.\nI chose CSUF because the midwifery program was designed to accommodate working nurses, which is rare to find. Many working nurses attend online programs, but being on campus was important to me because I love interacting with my professors and classmates in person. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs students, we benefit from such amenities as the School of Nursing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Fudge Family Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health Simulation Lab and Training Center. The lab provides a realistic environment to practice patient interactions with simulated manikins \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an invaluable experience. \nAs a queer, nonbinary person, I am proud of the diversity of CSUF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nursing cohorts to reflect the communities that we serve. My goal as a midwife is to incorporate shared decision-making into all interactions with patients. I want to help my patients feel heard and in charge of their care. I also hope to provide fertility assistance to queer couples. These goals feel attainable thanks to my education at Cal State Fullerton.Share Evelynn's StoryAbout the GiftThe Fudge Family Foundation made a transformational gift to support the School of Nursing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Fudge Family Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Health Simulation Lab and Training Center.
