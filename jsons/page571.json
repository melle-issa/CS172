The 24-hour online fundraising event surpassed its goal of 1,000 donations on April 25, raising more than $1 million for the Chapman Fund.\u00a0\n\u201cThis level of support demonstrates the unwavering belief that so many have in the work we do on our campuses,\u201d said Matt Parlow, Chapman\u2019s executive vice president and chief advancement officer. \u201cThis success is a testament to the tremendous momentum we have here at Chapman.\u201d\nThe daylong event focused on the importance of participation rather than the size of individual donations. With numerous matching and unlocking challenges throughout the day \u2013 including a matching challenge from Chapman University President Daniele C. Struppa and campus leadership early in the day \u2013 gifts of all sizes were valued and appreciated.\u00a0\n\u201cFrom spreading the word about Giving Day to each donation\u2019s collective impact, we are excited to see how our Chapman community came together to celebrate philanthropy on Giving Day,\u201d said Monica Martinez, manager of annual giving programs at Chapman.\nAs the end of Chapman\u2019s academic and fiscal year approaches, Giving Day caps a year of extraordinary fundraising for the university, including more than $325 million raised as part of Inspire: the Campaign for Chapman University, which publicly launched in February.\n\u201cWe are on the verge of setting a new record,\u201d Parlow said.\u00a0\nFunds raised on Giving Day go to the Chapman Fund, a foundational resource for scholarships, programs across the university, student activities, faculty development, research centers and more. Eighty-six percent of students at the university receive at least some financial aid, which means there is an ever-present need for support from donors.\u00a0\nIf you missed Giving Day, you can still make a difference for Chapman students with a gift to the Chapman Fund.\u00a0\n\n\n\nChapman Family Chapman Fund Giving Day scholarships \n\n\n\n\n \n\nStaci Dumoski \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPA Program Breaks Top 100 in First US News Ranking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPA Program Breaks Top 100 in First US News Ranking Chapman University\u2019s physician assistant program broke the top 100 in its first-ever ranking in U.S. News & World Report\u2019s Best Health Schools.
