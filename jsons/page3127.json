It generates PHP, JS, CSS code, and everything you need to start the project. It also integrates a modern build setup with no configuration.\nIt is largely inspired by create-react-app. Major kudos to @gaearon, the whole Facebook team, and the React community.\n\nBlocks are the fundamental elements of modern WordPress sites. Introduced in WordPress 5.0, they allow page and post builder-like functionality to every up-to-date WordPress website.\n\n\nLearn more about the Block API at the Gutenberg HandBook.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nQuick start\n\nUsage\n\nInteractive Mode\nslug\noptions\n\n\nAvailable Commands\nExternal Project Templates\nContributing to this package\n\nQuick start\n$ npx @wordpress/create-block todo-list\n$ cd todo-list\n$ npm start\nThe slug provided (todo-list in the example) defines the folder name for the scaffolded plugin and the internal block name. The WordPress plugin generated must be installed manually.\n(requires node version 14.0.0 or above, and npm version 6.14.4 or above)\n\nWatch a video introduction to create-block on Learn.wordpress.org\n\nUsage\nThe create-block command generates a project with PHP, JS, and CSS code for registering a block with a WordPress plugin.\n$ npx @wordpress/create-block [options] [slug]\n\n\nThe name for a block is a unique string that identifies a block. Block Names are structured as namespace/slug, where namespace is the name of your plugin or theme.\n\n\nIn most cases, we recommended pairing blocks with WordPress plugins rather than themes, because only using plugin ensures that all blocks still work when your theme changes.\n\nInteractive Mode\nWhen no slug is provided, the script will run in interactive mode and will start prompting for the input required (slug, title, namespace...) to scaffold the project.\nslug\nThe use of slug is optional.\nWhen provided it triggers the quick mode, where this slug is used:\n\nas the block slug (required for its identification)\nas the output location (folder name) for scaffolded files\nas the name of the WordPress plugin.\n\nThe rest of the configuration is set to all default values unless overridden with some options listed below.\noptions\n-V, --version                output the version number\n-t, --template <name>        project template type name; allowed values: \"static\" (default), \"es5\", the name of an external npm package, or the path to a local directory\n--no-plugin                  scaffold block files only\n--namespace <value>          internal namespace for the block name\n--title <value>              display title for the block and the WordPress plugin\n--short-description <value>  short description for the block and the WordPress plugin\n--category <name>            category name for the block\n--wp-scripts                 enable integration with `@wordpress/scripts` package\n--no-wp-scripts              disable integration with `@wordpress/scripts` package\n--wp-env                     enable integration with `@wordpress/env` package\n-h, --help                   output usage information\n--variant                    choose a block variant as defined by the template\n--template\nThis argument specifies an external npm package as a template.\n$ npx @wordpress/create-block --template my-template-package\nThis argument also allows to pick a local directory as a template.\n$ npx @wordpress/create-block --template ./path/to/template-directory\n--variant\nWith this argument, create-block will generate a dynamic block based on the built-in template.\n$ npx @wordpress/create-block --variant dynamic\n--help\nWith this argument, the create-block package outputs usage information.\n$ npx @wordpress/create-block --help\n--no-plugin\nWith this argument, the create-block package runs in No plugin mode which only scaffolds block files into the current directory.\n$ npx @wordpress/create-block --no-plugin\n--wp-env\nWith this argument, the create-block package will add to the generated plugin the configuration and the script to run wp-env package within the plugin. This will allow you to easily set up a local WordPress environment (via Docker) for building and testing the generated plugin.\n$ npx @wordpress/create-block --wp-env\nAvailable commands in the scaffolded project\nThe plugin folder created when executing this command, is a node package with a modern build setup that requires no configuration.\nA set of scripts is available from inside that folder (provided by the scripts package) to make your work easier. Click here for a full description of these commands.\nNote: You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to install or configure tools like webpack, Babel or ESLint yourself. They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on coding.\nFor example, running the start script from inside the generated folder (npm start) would automatically start the build for development.\nExternal Project Templates\nClick here for information on External Project Templates\nContributing to this package\nThis is an individual package that's part of the Gutenberg project.
