Nearly every theme uploaded gets through approval. Every theme uploaded gets looked at and an answer within a week.\u201d \n@kafleg mention that he is looking for help reviewing the accessibilityAccessibility Accessibility (commonly shortened to a11y) refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. The concept of accessible design ensures both \u201cdirect access\u201d (i.e. unassisted) and \u201cindirect access\u201d meaning compatibility with a person\u2019s assistive technology (for example, computer screen readers). (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility) part of a few themes and @williampatton was interested to help. \n\nAnd during the meeting, we cheer @acosmin for reviewing 4000+ themes so far. Thank you a lot for your contribution. \n\n2. Theme Handbook Overhaul Proposal\nThere was not much discussion happened in the meeting. But, we\u2019ll have a dedicated meeting for this proposal on #themereview channel at 13:00 UTC on April 18. I would like to request everyone to participate in the meeting and help us to finalize the outline. Or, if you can\u2019t make it, please leave a comment on the post or in the document.\n@greenshady said, \u201cIt\u2019d be great to get any feedback (negative or positive) on the direction, things you\u2019d change, or whatever your thoughts are. Or, are there any questions about the proposal?\u201d\nHe added, the biggest thing now is getting the outline to a stage that we all feel pretty good about. I think that will help us in the content phase. So, I definitely want folks to take some time to really think about how the handbook should flow from teaching someone who hasn\u2019t ever built a theme before to building their first one.\u00a0\n\n3. Review Theme Check pluginPlugin A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party PRs\nThe theme check plugin is updated and thanks to everyone who helped to check PRs and also help on fixing the issues. \nThere are a few PRs left to merge. You can check them as well. \n\n4. Open floor\nDuring the open floor, @poena said, she is looking for someone who can troubleshoot the theme test data update. We want theme authors and users to check the data and post their findings in the comment. \nProps to the meeting attendees: @greenshady, @williampatton, @Fitehal, @risager, @shrestharaaz, @bijayyadav \n#meeting, #meeting-notes, #themes-teamLogin to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\u2190 Older posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeetings\nTwice monthly at Tuesday @ 15:00 UTC\nJoin Slack\n#themereview\n\nSearch\n\n\n\nReview a Theme\nFull Site Editing Theme ExperimentsEmail Updates\n\n\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail Address\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJoin 2,024 other subscribers\t\t\t\t\n\nCollaborationIf you need help with your theme, feel free to post a job on WordPress Jobs.GithubThe Theme Review Coding Standards, \n\nTheme Sniffer Plugin, Theme Unit Test\n\nand more is available on:\n\ngithub.com/WPTT/Recent UpdatesRecent CommentsNo RepliesRecent UpdatesRecent CommentsNo RepliesRecent ActivityRecent PostsGPL Compatible ImagesOn the resource page, you can find links to websites that offers images under a license that is compatible with GPL.\n\nYou will also find information about image providers that you should avoid.\n\n\n\t\t\tTeam Pledges\n\t\t\n\n239 people have pledged time to contribute to Themes Team efforts!
