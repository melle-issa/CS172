It is the only social science that seeks to understand both human biological and cultural variation in the past and in the present.Encompassing a wide range of subjects spanning archaeology, cultural and linguistic anthropology, biological anthropology, and museum studies, anthropology is unique among the many fields that study humanity.\n                        Archaeology\n                    \n                        Cultural Anthropology\n                    \n                        Biological Anthropology\n                    \n                        Museum Studies\n                    EventsThursdays Fall/Spring Semester ~ Anthropology Forum\u00a04:00pm, Ayres Hall 120 or Zoom Online PresentationNewsEarth Day to be observed virtuallyOne of our Valene L.
