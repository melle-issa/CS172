The virus killed 2% of the world\u2019s population and produced high rates of mortality in healthy people, including those 20 to 40 years old, as reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nNow, a Chapman University professor has distilled the impact of the 1918-1920 pandemic on U.S. stock returns, finding that the rate of growth of pandemic-related deaths \u201cmay be an important factor in predicting stock returns and future economic conditions during a health crisis.\u201d\nSome of Marc Weidenmier\u2019s research on the impact of the 1918 flu on the stock market.\nMarc Weidenmier, a professor in Chapman\u2019s Argyros School of Business and Economics, painstakingly collected data from each week of the flu\u2019s spread and published a working paper through the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), where he is a research associate. He wanted to show the economic impact of a pandemic and chose the 1918 flu because it was \u201cthe closest thing\u201d to COVID-19 but didn\u2019t have the same outside influences, like government stimulus packages.\nWeidenmier says that while researchers have published papers about the 1918 flu pandemic, \u201cno one has pushed the angle of pandemic variables and prediction of stock equity markets and future economic conditions and recessions.\u201d\nOther papers on the subject have used monthly rather than weekly data, which can mask reality. Using weekly rather than monthly data \u201cgives you a lot more statistical power, and also gives you more insight into what\u2019s really going on,\u201d he says.\nSpikes in 1918 Flu Curb Stock Returns\nProfessor Mark Weidenmier\nThe paper shows that the most deadly spikes in the pandemic significantly reduced the stock market returns of the more than 130 firms tracked by Weidenmier and his research colleagues. The second spike of the pandemic lowered returns by 57 percent, and returns during the fourth spike were down 33 percent \u2013 a significant impact, according to the paper.\nPeople may be tempted to use Weidenmier\u2019s research to project the COVID pandemic\u2019s economic impact in the United States, but there are key differences \u2013 and the 1918 flu gives a better picture of impact, he says.\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little government intervention at that time, so it gives you kind of a clear take of the effect,\u201d says Weidenmier.\nBy contrast, \u201cit\u2019s hard to say what the impact of COVID was because there was a government-imposed lockdown. You had stimulus packages left and right, trillions of dollars. You had the Fed trying to cut interest rates to zero,\u201d he says.\nIn addition, there was also no vaccine for the 1918 flu.\nThat virus \u201chit the working-age population particularly hard, as opposed to COVID-19,\u201d which had the biggest impact on people older than 65, according to Weidenmier and his co-authors.\n\u201cThat was one of the motivations for the paper \u2013 we\u2019re going to look at a pandemic that affects the working-age population,\u201d Weidenmier says. \u201cIt\u2019s a short-term effect, but the effect is quite large.\u201d\nAdditionally, it turned out that death rates were even better at predicting recessions than the stock market was, Weidenmier says. There were two recessions during the 1918-1920 pandemic period. Death rates may be particularly effective at predicting recessions in emerging markets in places like South America and Southeast Asia, he says.\nHe and his co-authors gathered and digitized weekly stock data for 136 firms, using The New York Times\u2019 financial section from January 1918 to March 1920. They also used U.S. Census pneumonia mortality data from about 60 regions.\nBringing Fed Policy Leaders to Chapman\nMary Daly, CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, speaks with Professor Marc Weidenmier at Chapman University.\nWhen Mary Daly, CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, spoke at Chapman University last summer it was because of Professor Marc Weidenmier.\nSince 2018, Weidenmier has organized and moderated the Shadow Open Market Committee Conference at Chapman. The conference brings monetary economists from academia and private organizations together to discuss Fed policies.\nSince the first conference, \u201cwe\u2019ve had some really heavy hitters out here,\u201d Weidenmier says.\nThose include MIT\u2019s Deborah Lucas, former chief economist at the U.S. Congressional Budget Office; and Charles Plosser, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.\nThe June 2022 conference at which Daly gave the keynote speech drew coverage from national media outlets like The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and Fox Business.\n\n\n1918 flu Argyros School Argyros School of Business and Economics economy Fed national economy pandemic stock market stocks U.S. economy \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJoy Juedes \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Study Influences Wildfire Response\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Equity to the Urban Forest Canopy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Asia-Pacific Initiative Offers Unique Take on Hotbed Region Growing up in Los Angeles, Robert Koepp became fascinated with Asia.
