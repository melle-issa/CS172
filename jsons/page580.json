We look forward to seeing you!\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the McNair Scholars Program\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the McNair Scholars Program\nSonoma State University is one of approximately 187\u00a0institutions nation-wide to have the privilege of stewarding the McNair Scholars Program. A federally-funded TRiO Program, the McNair Scholars Program is designed to prepare high achieving undergraduate students for admission into graduate schools to pursue advanced degrees. Participants in the McNair Scholars Program are either first-generation college students with financial need or members of groups that are traditionally underrepresented in graduate education who have demonstrated strong academic potential. The McNair Scholars Program offers eligible students the opportunity to conduct faculty-mentored research, as well as travel opportunities and support during the graduate school application process. The McNair Scholars Program at SSU serves 27 students per academic year.\nProgram Benefits\nGraduate School Application Assistance\nIn order to ensure that every McNair Scholar has a competitive graduate school application, the McNair Scholars Program provides workshops and individual advising on topics such as writing strong statements of purpose, soliciting good letters of recommendation, preparing for the GRE exam, locating sources for funding, and choosing the right graduate school programs.\u00a0\nResearch Opportunities\nBeing engaged in research at the undergraduate level is one of the best ways to be both a highly competitive applicant and develop the kinds of abilities needed to succeed in graduate school. For this reason, SSU Faculty Mentors work individually with McNair Scholars, guiding them through the process of designing and developing a research project to be presented at our annual symposium and published in our academic journal. McNair Scholars are also encouraged to present their research projects at regional and national conferences. Participants who meet all program requirements are eligible to receive a stipend of up to $2,800 upon completion of the research project.\nTravel Opportunities\nMcNair Scholars may receive funding to travel to professional conferences and present their research. Travel funding is also available for students to\u00a0visit campuses to which they have applied in order to increase their chances of getting accepted or to make informed decisions about the best graduate school program to enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcNair Scholars Program\n\nMcNair Home\nHistory\nApplication\nJournal\nMeet SSU's McNair Scholars\nFAQ\nFaculty Mentors\nRelated Programs\nWorkshops\nEvents and Opportunities\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\"The remarkable faculty and staff of the McNair Scholars Program believed in me before I did.
