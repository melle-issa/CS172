Should we remove custom colors completely from this PR and tackle the GS issue first then? That means we can't remove the custom filters from the toolbar until we have it working on the inspector either.\n\nPart of #39452\nWhy?\nRight now the toolbar is the only place to edit the duotone filters on a block level. This PR brings the UI in line with other controls and paves the way for future simplification of the toolbar options.\nHow?\nBy leveraging the new panel StylesFiltersPanel and displaying it using a dropdown. This alters how the panel looks on Global Styles right now too\nTesting Instructions\nI'm using Skatepark because it applies duotone on all images, but testing on block theme that doesn't is also appropriate.\nCheck the new panel in the inspector while editing an image and that you can apply the filters in the same way as you would from the toolbar.\nTest the same but on global styles, applied to all images on the site.\nScreenshots or screencast \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n MaggieCabrera\n  \n\n        added 4 commits\n        \nApril 14, 2023 16:54\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nadd a filter slot and insert StylesFiltersPanel on the duotone hook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8da1330\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nfixed duotone value and onchange function\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncf970bc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nremoved label from slot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naf984c0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nenable custom colors and duotone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n057be54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaggieCabrera\n\n\n\n    mentioned this pull request\n    \nApr 14, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n      Duotone: add block controls on the inspector\n      #48405\n \n\n\n Closed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMaggieCabrera\n\n\n            commented\n\n\n            \n\nApr 14, 2023\n\n\n\n\n \nView reviewed changes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\npackages/block-editor/src/hooks/duotone.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t/>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t</InspectorControls>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<BlockControls group=\"block\" __experimentalShareWithChildBlocks>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t<DuotoneControl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaggieCabrera\n\nApr 14, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a problem hiding this comment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose a reason for hiding this comment\n\n      The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others.

That said, until we actually do have more filters, it might be best to call it still \"Duotone\", we can always rename.\nOne thing I'm missing from the mockups, though, is the ItemGroup+Flyout combo, this one:\n\nThis is mainly to compress the space usage in the inspector. There are a lot of other valuable options there, including border and radius, and even if we could push \"Duotone\" down below, it wouldn't really help the overall glancability.\nWould it be possible to move this into such an ItemGroup+Flyout combo?

Thanks so much for putting it in the itemgroup, this feels validating to me in practice. Here's Global Styles > All blocks > Images > Filters > Duotone:\n\nNote that when the flyout is invoked from the inspector, it should use the default popover style. Light gray border, small drop shadow underneath:\n\nThe almost black border is meant to only be applied to popovers that open from the block toolbar:\n\nLast I worked on this, the prop was called isAlternate (showing the black borders), but I also think there was an intent or effort to have this prop be refactored away, and be automatically applied depending on where the popover was opened from. CC: @ciampo in case you recall what I'm referring to.\nPost editor generally looks good, the compression in the inspector yet again validates the use of the itemgroup:\n\nNoting here that duotone can be applied to at least the image block, even in the setup state.

Before I open a new issue, I found a little more context in #45137, where the \"isAlternate\" is refactored/deprecated in favor of a variant.\nBut it boils down to this, you can have two styles of popovers. This one:\n\nNotice how it opens from the block toolbar and has the same black borders as the block toolbar.\nThis one:\n\nNotice how it doesn't open from the block toolbar, and has the light gray borders, plus a drop shadow.\nThe thing is, a developer should not have to choose a variant if we can automate this for them. The gray with box shadow can be default, but if something opens from the block toolbar, it should always be the dark version. That way we avoid this issue where someone forgot the variant:\n\nWorth a ticket, I feel like there may have already been one?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\n\n\n\nciampo\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 28, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you for the great explanation around the context for this, @jasmussen !\nI think this could be something that we could do via context APIs\n\nset the default version to be the \"light\" one\nchange the default when the Dropdown / Popover is rendered within the Toolbar component\n\n\nWorth a ticket, I feel like there may have already been one?\n\nYou're right, @mirka had already opened one: #45246\nI'll go ahead and update it with the additional context from your comment above\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ud83d\ude80\n1\n jasmussen reacted with rocket emoji\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n1 reaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nciampo\n\n\n\n    mentioned this pull request\n    \nApr 28, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n      Popover: Prefer isAlternate style when rendering from Toolbar\n      #45246\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSign up for free\nto join this conversation on GitHub.\n    Already have an account?\n    Sign in to comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Reviewers\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nyouknowriad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyouknowriad approved these changes\n\n\n\n\n\n \nscruffian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscruffian approved these changes\n\n\n\n\n\n \najlende\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nellatrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ndraganescu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ngetdave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \njeryj\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Assignees\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nMaggieCabrera\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Labels\n  \n\n\n[Feature] Design Tools\n\nTools that manipulate visual aspects of blocks.\n\n[Type] Enhancement\n\nA suggestion for improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Projects\n  \n\n\n\n    None yet\n\n\n \n\n\n\n    Milestone\n  \n\n\n \nGutenberg 15.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Development\n  \nSuccessfully merging this pull request may close these issues.\nNone yet\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n      6 participants\n    \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAdd this suggestion to a batch that can be applied as a single commit.\nThis suggestion is invalid because no changes were made to the code.\nSuggestions cannot be applied while the pull request is closed.\nSuggestions cannot be applied while viewing a subset of changes.\nOnly one suggestion per line can be applied in a batch.\nAdd this suggestion to a batch that can be applied as a single commit.\nApplying suggestions on deleted lines is not supported.\nYou must change the existing code in this line in order to create a valid suggestion.\nOutdated suggestions cannot be applied.\nThis suggestion has been applied or marked resolved.\nSuggestions cannot be applied from pending reviews.\nSuggestions cannot be applied on multi-line comments.\nSuggestions cannot be applied while the pull request is queued to merge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n        \u00a9 2023 GitHub, Inc.\n        \n\n\n\nFooter navigation\n\nTerms\nPrivacy\nSecurity\nStatus\nDocs\nContact GitHub\nPricing\nAPI\nTraining\nBlog\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    You can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n  \n\n\n\n\nYou signed in with another tab or window.
