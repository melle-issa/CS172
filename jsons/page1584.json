You can find us at Munger Building 2, 895 Campus Drive, Room 102, Stanford, CA 94305\nCall us at (650) 723-3392.

We offer anonymous 24/7 peer counseling to members of the greater Stanford community. Staffed by trained undergraduate and graduate Stanford students, we are here to listen and support. It is our belief that people have the fundamental ability to help and support others through personal interaction. We offer this interaction through peer counseling and support in an effort to guide those in need to develop their own solutions to problems. We are here to listen, to explore feelings, to help sort out issues and uncertainties, or just to talk..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Involved\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to have you join us and we think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll love it too! Our counselors credit their experience with the Bridge for helping them in their personal lives and as preparation for jobs in a wide variety of fields including medicine, research, teaching, and social services. We were awarded ASSU Volunteer Student Organization of the Year in 2012, and by joining the Bridge, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re joining the effort to help members of the Stanford community keep doing the amazing things they do and be the amazing people they are!\nOnly Stanford undergraduate and graduate students are eligible to staff at the Bridge. If you are a student and would like to become a Bridge counselor, you must successfully complete the following:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEducation 193A \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Listen Up! Core Peer Counseling Skills (2 units)\nEducation 193P \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Peer Counseling at the Bridge (1 unit)\nAn evaluation upon completion of Education 193A\n\n\nThe training courses are offered every quarter (plenty of opportunities to join our staff throughout the year).  We encourage aspiring counselors to take 193A followed by 193P.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve completed another course in peer counseling elsewhere, we still require that you complete the specified courses prior to staffing at The Bridge in order to make sure that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all on the same page in terms of style and competency. We welcome students of all skill levels, however \u00e2\u0080\u0093 no prior experience is required.\nThe Bridge is entirely student-run and staffed. Students fill a variety of positions. Staff members serve as volunteer counselors for a few hours each week after completing the 10-week training course. Coordinators directly administer publicity, finances, workshops, and dorm outreach programs in addition to other activities. The live-ins are the resident counselors at The Bridge, serving as the administrative and peer counseling leadership, and the backbone of our 24-hour peer counseling service.\n  How can I get involved if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a Stanford student? \nIf you are not a student, but represent another organization or would like to get involved in some way, please contact us at thebridgepeercounseling@gmail.com with information about yourself and ideas for potential collaborations.\n How can I make a donation?\nThe Bridge is a student-run, self-supported campus organization with the unique quality (and added expense) of managing and maintaining a residential building for our live-in counselors. If you would like to make a donation to the Bridge, please contact us at thebridgepeercounseling@gmail.com  and someone will get back to you with additional information.\nMore Questions? Contact Us!\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory\nFounded by Dr. Vincent D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Andrea, the Bridge began in 1971 primarily as\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta student-run drug counseling center. Dr. D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Andrea also created and taught a set of courses for\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstudent counselors. Yale University President Peter Salovey BA \u00e2\u0080\u009980 MA \u00e2\u0080\u009880, who served as\n\t\t\t\t\t\ta Bridge Peer Counselor between 1977-1980, co-wrote the textbook \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeer Counseling: Skills and Perspectives\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\t\t\t\t\t\twith Dr. D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Andrea. This textbook is still used to instruct the Bridge peer counselors in EDUC 193A today.\nSince then, the Bridge has evolved into a general peer counseling, workshop, and support center\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor Stanford University and the surrounding area. The Bridge now is a community of staffers,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcoordinators, and live-in counselors who receive ongoing training and evaluation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDr. Alejandro Martinez, who worked with our founder D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Andrea for 24 years, has been advising the Bridge for more than two decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\nIn an emergency, call 911.\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\nStanford Office of Accessible Education\n\n\n\nAddiction/Substance Abuse\n\nAddiction Center  (855) 706-9275\nBehavior Health Services Santa Clara\nNational Rehab Hotline\nOffice of Alcohol Policy and Education (OAPE)\nWomen's Recovery Association  +1 (650) 348-6603\n\n\n\nAcademics\n\nAthletic Academic Resource Center (AARC)\nCenter for Teaching and Learning (CTL)\nHume Center for Writing and Speaking\nPeer Tutoring and Language Practice\nUndergraduate Advising and Research (UAR) (650) 723-2426\n\n\n\n\n\nBody Image & Eating Disorders\n\nEating Disorders Resource Center\nNEDA (National Eating Disorder Association) Helpline (800) 931-2237\nOvereaters Anonymous 505-891-2664\nStanford Dept. of Psychiatry\nVaden Health Center 650-498-2336\n\n\n\nCareer\n\nBEAM (Career Education) 650-725-1789\n\n\n\nFamily (Children, Spouse, & Parents) Services\n\nCalifornia Department of Social Services\nEscondido Village Family Fund\nFamily Service Agency of San Mateo County\nSanta Clara Social Services Agency\nStanford Parent-Net Mailing List\nWorkLife Office\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial\n\nFinancial Aid Office\nStudent Services Center (SSC)\n\n\n\nGeneral or Miscellaneous Resources\n\nGraduate Life Office\nOffice of Community Standards\nResidence Deans\nStudent Services Center\n\n\n\nGrief\n\nKara\nOffice for Religious Life\n\n\n\n\n\nImmigration / International Students\n\nBechtel International Center\nStanford Immigration News\n\n\n\nLegal Resources\n\nLegal Counseling Office (LCO)\nOmbuds Office\n\n\n\nLGBTQ\n\nQSpot 650-725-4222\nQueer Student Resources \nBilly DeFrank Community Center \n\n\n\n\n\nMilitary Affiliated Communities\n\nOffice for Military-Affiliated Communities (OMAC)  \n\n\n\nPregnancy\n\nThe Emergency Contraception Website\nGynecology Clinic at Stanford \nPlanned Parenthood (Mountain View) 1-800-230-7526\nSHPRC 650-SAFE-SEX (723-3739)\n\n\n\nPsychological Services\n\nCounseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)\n 650-723-3785\nEmergency Psychiatric Services (EPS)\n 1 (408) 885-6100\nMental Health Call Center 1-800-704-0900\nSAMHSA Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator\nSAMHSA National Helpline   1-800-662-HELP (4357)\n\n\n\n\n\nRace, Gender, & Community\n\nAsian American Activities Center (A3C) \nThe Black Community Services Center \nNative American Cultural Center \nEl Centro Chicano \nStanford Women's Community Center \nLGBT Community Resources Center\n\n\n\nRelationships, Physical and Sexual Abuse\n\nCORA \nConfidential Support Team (CST)   650-725-9955\nLa Casa de las Madres \nLove is Respect  1-866-331-9474\nThe National Domestic Violence Hotline  1\u00e2\u0088\u0092800\u00e2\u0088\u0092799\u00e2\u0088\u00927233\nNot Alone Stanford \nNext Door: Solutions to Domestic Violence  (408) 279-2962\nSexual Assault & Relationship Abuse (SARA) Office  650-725-1056\nYWCA Silicon Valley Crisis Intervention  800-572-2782\n\n\n\nReligious Services\n\nOffice for Religious Life\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety\n\nCalifornia Poison Control 1\u00e2\u0080\u0091800\u00e2\u0080\u0091222\u00e2\u0080\u00911222\nDepartment of Public Safety 1\u00e2\u0080\u0091800\u00e2\u0080\u0091222\u00e2\u0080\u00911222\n5-SURE: Service (650-725-7873)\n\n\n\nSexual Health\n\nSHPRC 650-SAFE-SEX (723-3739)\n\n\n\nStress Management\n\nYes + Stanford\n\n\n\n\n\nWellness and Health\n\nStanford Health Library\nWellness at Stanford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\nEmail us at thebridgepeercounseling@gmail.com\nYou are also welcome to stop by in person to ask questions.
