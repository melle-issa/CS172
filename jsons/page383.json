But first, this summer, he\u2019ll be back digging in Montana. \n\n\n\u201cThe University of Washington and specifically the (Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture) are actually the rightful owners of the fossils that I\u2019m working on right now. They\u2019ve left it to us and our crew for the preparation process,\u201d Rotenberg said. \u201cEventually, all of the bones that are in my lab will eventually end up in their collection at the University of Washington, so it\u2019s very exciting to be able to continue my education and follow this dinosaur along as it completes its journey.\u201d\nRotenberg said he has been a huge dinosaur fan since he was a kid, so his family is not\u00a0 surprised that he ultimately found his way into a dinosaur lab.\n\u201cWe talk a lot about thinking outside of the box here at Chapman, so this is just kind of an opportunity for students to be able to do that,\u201d he said, adding that the doors to their lab are always open for Chapman students or members of the community who want learn more about the process of uncovering fossils.\nRelated Articles\nLocal News |  \n\n\t\t\tOrange County Classical Academy eyes traditional school campuses for its expansion\t\t\n\n\nLocal News |  \n\n\t\t\tAfter OUSD hastily fired its superintendent, state legislator looks to implement safeguards\t\t\n\n\nLocal News |  \n\n\t\t\t\u2018We\u2019ve got a little hero:\u2019 Michigan seventh grader honored for taking over school bus when driver passed out\t\t\n\n\nLocal News |  \n\n\t\t\tWant to intern this summer for The Orange County Register?
