Many who take them will barely recognize the new space. What had been an incoherent hodgepodge of departments \u2014 Dinno likened the previous layout to \u201ca corn maze\u201d \u2014 has been clarified and simplified to the point that students will hopefully no longer get lost searching for their classrooms or the offices of their professors.\n\nPointing to a map of the old Stevenson, he noted that the 12 departments of the School of Social Sciences were located in scattershot fashion on all three floors.\n\u201cThey\u2019re all over the place,\u201d said Dinno.\nIn addition to contributing many of the ideas executed in the blueprints by the San Francisco architecture firm EHDD, Dinno had to figure out who would be occupying the new space. To make Stevenson a \u201ctrue academic building,\u201d the decision was made to move many people \u2014 including the university president \u2014 elsewhere, for good.\nTransferred out were the administrative offices, including those of the president and provost, along with the university\u2019s Media Center, and offices of advancement and alumni affairs, among others.\nRemaining behind, on a floor plan that\u2019s far better organized and intuitive, are the Schools of Social Sciences, Business & Economics, and Education.\nClassrooms had been located on all three floors of the old building. While four labs have been placed on the second floor of the renovated building, its 22 classrooms are on the first floor \u2014 \u201cso you\u2019ve got all that energy now on the first level,\u201d said Dinno.\nNineteen classrooms have 32 seats. One has 64, another, 128. The largest lecture hall seats 224 students.\nEntering that 224-seat hall, Dinno effused about its \u201c21st century, high technology\u201d and \u201cincredible\u201d acoustics, with sounds \u201csoftly bouncing\u201d off the sawtooth ceiling and combed concrete walls, \u201cso it\u2019s not like an echo chamber.\u201d\nThat room is one of seven new \u201chigh flex\u201d classrooms, set up for both students who are physically present, and others following along virtually. Cameras track the professor walking back and forth on the stage, and students with whom they interact. Voices are picked up by an array of microphones in the ceiling.\nIn addition to coming in handy when students aren\u2019t able to attend classes, said Sonoma State economics professor Robert Eyler, going out of his way to not use the word \u201cpandemic,\u201d high flex classrooms are also well-suited for courses with a global audience, such as those taught in the university\u2019s Executive Wine MBA program.\nThe old building housed a trio of stairways, each sheathed in concrete walls.\nTwo of those stairways have moved outdoors, in the new version. The new stairways are open-air, unenclosed. Those shear concrete walls, reinforced to resist seismic shocks, have been moved to the perimeter of the building. Putting the \u201cexoskeleton\u201d on the outside, said Dinno, \u201cfreed up all that space in the center.\u201d\nSpeaking of wide-open spaces, the star of this makeover is arguably the vast atrium that has replaced what had been a drafty, exposed, underutilized courtyard.\nThe Stevenson of old was notorious for its unwelcoming, concrete-forward facade. In focus groups and feasibility studies conducted before the building was designed, students and faculty asked for a more welcoming, communal space.\nThe atrium, flooded with sun streaming through its skylights, looks east on quadrangle, framed by the Sonoma Mountains in the background. It is destined to become a popular spot to study, hang out between classes, or chill with friends.\nDinno was also excited about smaller gathering places scattered throughout the building \u2014 he referred to them as \u201ceddies\u201d \u2014 spaces for students to sit between classes, or while waiting to meet a professor.\n\nWhile the building is \u201cinstitutional,\u201d said Dinno, its exposed ceilings and collaborative spaces give it a \u201cSilicon Valley vibe.\u201d\nBy removing offices from the perimeter, architects vastly increased the amount of light penetrating to the core of the building.\nEyler, who has occupied seven different offices at Stevenson since arriving at Sonoma State in 1995, recalled the old building as \u201cvery dark.\u201d\n\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s got this much ambient light in a closed space \u2014 it\u2019s unbelievable. It's blowing my mind.\u201d\nYou can reach Staff Writer Austin Murphy at austin.murphy@pressdemocrat.com or on Twitter @ausmurph88.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATED: Please read and follow our commenting policy:\n\n\nThis is a family newspaper, please use a kind and respectful tone.\nNo profanity, hate speech or personal attacks.
