[UCR] really does live up to its title of being one of the most diverse campuses in the United States.\u201d \n\u00a0\nViresha Perera, from Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates\nPsychology Major\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying to UCR\nAs one of the most prestigious universities in the United States, UCR sets high admission standards. Incoming students are selected based on a wide range of criteria, including academic performance and the potential for success as an undergraduate.\nEach year we celebrate the valuable perspective of over 1,700 international students at UCR. They represent more than 88 countries and enhance our campus and worldwide community.\n\n\n3.4\nMinimum High School Non-Resident Grade Point Average (GPA) Requirement (2.8 for transfer students)\n\n\n21:1\nStudent-to-Faculty Ratio\n\n\n4.04\nEnrolled Academic Years to Degree Completion\n(UCR Institutional Research Campus Statistics, 2018\u201319)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nUC Riverside School Codes\nUse these codes when sending exam scores to UCR:\nTOEFL / AP / SAT: 004839\nACT: 0456\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational First-Year Students\nAlong with the minimum admissions requirements that California residents must meet, international applicants must also follow these instructions that apply specifically to them. Prepare for admission to UCR with the International First-Year Admission Checklist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\nUC Riverside will not consider SAT or ACT test scores when making admissions decisions or awarding scholarships. If you choose to submit test scores as part of your application, they may be used as an alternative method of fulfilling minimum requirements for eligibility or for course placement after you enroll. Details regarding UC\u2019s testing policy can be found online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Comprehensive Review    \n\nComprehensive review is the process by which UC Riverside (UCR) evaluates first-year applicants, who meet minimum UC requirements, using multiple measures of achievement and promise, while considering the context in which each student has demonstrated accomplishment. UCR will calculate an Academic Index Score (AIS) for all first-year applicants. The faculty of UCR have designated the measures described below to be used to calculate the AIS.\nHigh School GPA\u2014The strength of an applicant\u2019s high school GPA is the strongest indicator that a student will be successful within an academically challenging UC environment. The capped GPA is calculated on the basis of all completed \u201ca-g\u201d courses with extra points added for UC-approved honors courses taken in grades 10 and 11, capped at 8 semesters. A capped GPA considers the extra points earned for honors-level courses and may exceed 4.0 for some students.\nAdvanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses\u2014AP and IB courses prepare students for college-level coursework. Therefore, students who take and do well in these courses tend to have a high probability for success within the UC environment.\nEligibility in the Local Context (ELC)\u2014The Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC) program recognizes the individual accomplishments of students in light of the opportunities offered by their particular high school.\nLow Family Income\u2014Students who demonstrate high academic achievement, despite low socioeconomic status, are likely to exhibit persistence, maturity, and insight. Low family income is determined based on total family members and household income.\nFirst-Generation University Attendance\u2014 UC-eligible applicants who are the first in their immediate family to attend college are apt to have personal strengths that will contribute to their academic success. Students whose parents have not graduated from a four-year college or university are qualified for first-generation university attendance.\n\n\n\n\n            English Language Proficiency (International First-Year Students Only)    \n\nYou can demonstrate proficiency by meeting any of the following exam benchmarks. Keep in mind that you must complete one of these exams by December of your final year of high school/secondary school.\n\u2022 Score 24 or higher for the ACT English Language Arts (ELA)\n\u2022 Score 31 or higher on Writing and Language in the SAT\u00a0\n\u2022 Score 3, 4 or 5 on the AP examination in English Language and Composition, or English Literature and Composition\n\u2022 Score 6 or 7 on the IB Standard Level examination in English (Language A only)\u00a0\n\u2022 Score 5, 6 or 7 on the IB Higher Level examination in English (Language A only)\u00a0\n\u2022 Score 6.5 or higher on the International English Language Testing System (IELTS)\n\u2022 Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) examination:\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Internet-based test (iBT): Minimum score of 80 or better\n\u00a0 \u00a0- Paper-delivered test: Minimum score of 60 or better\n\u2022 Duolingo English Test (DET): Minimum score of 115\u00a0\nBecome a More Competitive Applicant \nImprove essential academic and languages skills with UCR\u2019s Admission Preparation Program (APP)\u00a0!\nParticipating in this educational program does not in itself provide preference in admission to the University of California. If you're interested in applying to UCR, view the first-year student admission requirements or the transfer student admission requirements. You can also contact the UCR Undergraduate Admissions office for details about the admission process.\n\n\n\n\n            Exam Credit    \n\nAdvanced Placement \nUCR grants credit for all Advanced Placement exams on which a student scores three or higher. Units awarded toward UC graduation may be granted for specific subjects and/or for general education/ breadth requirements, as determined by each campus. AP exams can also be used to meet the minimum transfer admission subject requirements in English, math, and four other courses chosen from the humanities, behavioral/social sciences, and biological/physical sciences.\nInternational Baccalaureate\nThe IB organization awards either a diploma or a certificate for individual IB exams. Students who complete the IB diploma with a score of 30 or above will receive 30 quarter (20 semester) units toward their UC degree. Students who receive IB certificates with a score of five or higher on Higher Level exams will receive eight quarter (5.3 semester) units.\nA-Level Examinations\nUCR grants credit for the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced Levels (A-Levels), the Cambridge International A-Levels, the Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Levels (H2), and the previously administered Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (HKALE), in content-based subjects similar to courses offered at UC and in which grades of A*, A, B, or C are awarded. UCR grants 12 quarter (eight semester) units of credit for academic courses only for GCE, Singapore-Cambridge, and Hong Kong A-Level exams.\nExam Credit\u00a0\n\nAP exams with a score of 3 and above\nIB HL exams with a score of 5 and above\n\n\n\n\n\n            High School Coursework    \n\nYou must earn a grade of C or better in all college-preparatory (\u201ca\u2013g\u201d) courses:\n\nHistory/Social Science: 2 years\nEnglish: 4 years\nMathematics: 3 years, 4 recommended\nLaboratory Science: 2 years (3 years recommended)\nLanguage Other than English: 2 years, 3 recommended\nVisual and Performing Arts: 1 year\nCollege-Preparatory Elective: 1 year\n\n\n\nFor country-specific admission requirements, visit international admissions requirements by country or educational system. For questions, visit admissions.ucr.edu/ask.\n\n\n\n\n            Academic Achievement    \n\nTo meet minimum requirements to be considered for UCR selection, you must earn a minimum GPA of 3.4 on a 4.0 scale (equivalent to an 85 percent on a 100 percent scale). The assessment of a qualifying GPA is based on \u201ca\u2013g\u201d courses (required high school/secondary classes) completed in years 10 and 11. If the high school/secondary school offers a different curriculum, your academic achievement will be based on that educational system\u2019s grading scale.\n\n\n\n\n            Visa & U.S. Entry Requirements    \n\nInternational students need a valid passport, nonimmigrant visa (F-1 or J-1), and the appropriate documentation to study at an accredited university in the United States. Learn more about visa and U.S. entry requirements.\nOnce you are admitted to UCR, the International Students and Scholars (ISS) office will provide support services such as visa assistance and cultural/educational programs, which will help you transition into life in America and life at UCR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Gather Your Information    \n\nBefore you begin, find out what important information is needed for an accurate admission application.

The fee is $80 for each UC. You can apply for a fee waiver \u2014 provided you have your family\u2019s income and the number of people supported by it \u2014 when you fill out the application. The fall application filing period is Nov. 1-30.

UCR's admissions selection process is the same for both international and U.S.-educated applicants.\nTransfer applicants are registered at a college/university for a regular session after high school. Transfer applicants cannot disregard their college record and apply as a first-year student.\nU.S. citizens or permanent residents, who have completed coursework outside the United States, should follow the international admissions requirements for the country in which the coursework was completed. If you are transferring from a four-year, out-of-state two-year, or UC school, please see special instructions that apply to you.\nIf you are transferring from a California Community College, your admission requirements are outlined below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Required Units & Minimum GPA     \n\n\nYou must complete 60 semester (90 quarter) units of transferrable college credit.\nAdmission to UCR is selective, so strive to surpass the minimum.\nSome major programs require a minimum GPA that is higher than that of basic admission.\nNo more than 14 semester (21 quarter) units may be Pass/Not Pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n            Required Community College Classes    \n\nYou need to complete the following seven-course pattern by the end of the spring term prior to fall enrollment at UCR (or the fall term prior to enrollment if you're applying for winter admission):\n\nTwo transferrable courses in English composition\nOne transferrable course in mathematical concepts and quantitative reasoning\nFour transferred courses chosen from at least two of these subject areas: arts and humanities, social and behavioral sciences, or physical and biological sciences Each course must be transferrable and worth at least 3 semester (4\u20135 quarter) units.\n\n\u00a0\nUse ASSIST.org to see if your classes will transfer before taking them.\nStudents transferring from California Community Colleges can use the UC Transfer Admission Planner (UC TAP) to track your coursework and monitor your progress. You can enter your coursework (completed and planned) from the beginning of your college career (or whenever you decide to transfer to UCR). You should still meet with counselors, as this tool does not replace in-person advising. The UC TAP also serves as your Transfer Admission Guarantee (TAG)\u00a0application.\n\n\n\n\n            Exam Credit    \n\nAdvanced Placement \nWe grant credit for all Advanced Placement exams on which a student scores 3 or higher. Units awarded toward UC graduation may be granted for specific subjects and/or for general education/ breadth requirements, as determined by each campus. AP exams can also be used to meet the minimum transfer admission subject requirements in English, math and four other courses chosen from the humanities, behavioral/social sciences and biological/physical sciences.\nInternational Baccalaureate\nThe IB organization awards either a diploma or a certificate for individual IB exams. Students who complete the IB diploma with a score of 30 or above will receive 30 quarter (20 semester) units toward their UC degree. Students who receive IB certificates with a score of 5 or higher on Higher Level exams will receive 8 quarter (5.3 semester) units.\nA-Level Examinations\nWe award credit for the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced Levels (A-Levels), the Cambridge International A-Levels, the Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Levels (H2) and the previously administered Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (HKALE), in content-based subjects similar to courses offered at UC and in which grades of A*, A, B or C are awarded. We grant 12 quarter (8 semester) units of credit for academic courses only for GCE, Singapore-Cambridge and Hong Kong A-Level exams.\n\n\n\n\n            Visa & U.S. Entry Requirements    \n\nInternational students need a valid passport, nonimmigrant visa (F-1 or J-1) and the appropriate documentation to study at an accredited university in the United States. Learn more about visa and U.S. entry requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Get into Your Major\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            For All Majors    \n\n\nIn general, each major has prerequisite (major prep) coursework that you must take before transferring in order to get into your major.\nTake the recommended lower-division/general education/breadth classes for your major. Students who transfer from California Community Colleges can take the recommended lower-division/general education/breadth classes for your major. Some programs recommend the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC), which is a series of courses that California Community College students can complete to satisfy first- and second-year general education requirements before transferring. Some programs want you to focus on prerequisites instead of IGETC. Use ASSIST.org to see what your major program recommends or contact a UCR admissions counselor for help.\nEach major has a minimum GPA requirement. Some majors require a GPA higher than that required for basic admission. Programs are selective. Strive to surpass your program\u2019s minimum GPA. Remember: All transferrable coursework will be taken into account.\n\n\n\n\n\n            Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering Requirements    \n\nBreadth Requirements \nYou are strongly encouraged to focus on preparatory course work (mathematics, science, and technical work) for your desired major rather than on IGETC completion. However, the Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering (BCOE) does accept completion of IGETC as satisfying the majority of breadth requirements. Additional breadth coursework may be required after enrollment at BCOE.\nPrerequisites \nStrong technical preparation is essential for success in the admissions process and, subsequently, in all coursework at BCOE. If you intend to transfer to an engineering major, you are expected to complete the equivalent of UCR coursework required in the first two years of the programs and apply for transfer starting your junior year. Use ASSIST.org\u00a0to see the prerequisites you must take for your intended major (and to make sure your classes will transfer).\nMinimum GPA \nStrive to surpass the 2.8 minimum GPA.\nLearn more about transferring to BCOE.\n\n\n\n\n            College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences Requirements    \n\nBreadth Requirements\nComplete IGETC or the UCR breadth pattern for the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (CHASS).\u00a0\nPrerequisites\nUse ASSIST.org to see the prerequisites you must take for your intended major (and to make sure your classes will transfer).\nMinimum GPA\nStrive to surpass the 2.8\u00a0minimum GPA.\nLearn more about transferring to CHASS.\nConnect with the Transfers First Program for support, advocacy, planning, and more.\n\n\n\n\n            College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences Requirements    \n\nBreadth Requirements\nYou are strongly encouraged to focus on completing transferable math and science classes.
