During the first two years, the initiative is looking to support nearly 800 students. The program is a strategy of UC\u2019s 2030 Capacity Plan, which aims to increase UC enrollment by 23,000 students over the next eight years.\u00a0\nThe UC Degree Completion Program aims to reengage adults through the UCR University Extension, UC Davis Continuing and Professional Education, along with UC Santa Barbara Professional and Continuing Education, and UC Merced Extension. The Santa Barbara and Merced campuses had previously launched the degree-completion program.\u00a0\nHaving four campuses now work toward one goal amplifies the reach and allows students to continue their education either online or in person, depending on the options available at each respective campus.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cStudents who qualify may receive financial assistance for application fees and may be eligible for federal financial aid once they are readmitted to a UC campus,\u201d said Marie C. Martin, director of academic quality, integrity, and assessment at UCR University Extension. \u201cThis program is two-fold: On one hand, we want to reduce the number of students who are dedicating their time and resources to an education, and not walking away with a degree. Secondly, we want to connect them with educational opportunities that advance their career outcomes and improve their prospects in life. The goal is to be part of the solution.\u201d\nSusan Catron, dean of UC Davis Continuing and Professional Education, said she is proud that UC Davis is among the program partners.\n\u201cThe UC Degree Completion Program will empower adult learners,\u201d Catron said. \u201cWe are going to provide very real support as people take initiative to continue their education, complete their degree, and forge their future.\u201d\u00a0\nThe program aims to support working professionals, unemployed, and underemployed adults, and to address specific barriers by helping with application fees, providing advising support, and alleviating challenges associated with familial and professional obligations, Martin said.\u00a0\n\u201cNationally, graduation rates continue to be a significant problem. But over the last ten years, UCR successfully increased graduation rates while decreasing differences along racial and socioeconomic lines,\u201d said Elizabeth Watkins, UCR provost and executive vice chancellor. \u201cHelping those who didn\u2019t complete their degrees, whether they attended UCR or other institutions, seems like the next logical step in student success leadership.\u201d\nAccording to a recent survey by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, California has the greatest number of stop-outs in the United States: over 6.3 million and a full 17.5% of such adults in the United States.\u00a0\nAccording to UCR\u2019s student data analysis, 6,030 students who were in an undergraduate program between 2008-2020 left UCR in good standing but did not complete a degree. This included both first time freshmen and transfer students who come from under-represented minorities, 4,592 (76%), and first-generation students 2,901 (48%). The effort will complement other retention and reengagement strategies the campus is pursuing, aimed at those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic via a Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, or HEERF, grant.\u00a0\nUC Davis proposes to establish a reengagement/reentry campaign focused on degree stop-outs from 2009 to 2018 who have completed 60 quarter units of instruction with at least a two-quarter lapse in their studies. The UC Davis campaign will target 3,862 students in good standing, including 1,716 (44%) first generation students and 1,095 (28%) under-represented students.\nThe two-year $4.85 million originates from the 2019 State budget. Although students can elect to complete a certificate from the entire portfolio of qualifying certificate programs, UC leaders have identified critical programs offered by UCR and UC Davis. These programs will be expanded to serve more learners on the assumption that some learners, such as those whose careers were disrupted by the pandemic, may be seeking jobs in demand, including:\u00a0\n\nUCR: Teacher education specializations (ethnic studies, transitional kindergarten/early childhood, special education), homeless support specialist, forensic nursing, community health worker\nUC Davis: Pre-health, construction management, accounting principles, front end web development\n\nThe funded work of UCSB and UC Merced for workforce development will be further supported through the consortium\u2019s community of advisors, operations sharing and program sharing models.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled that we received these funds from the State of California to support our educational attainment efforts,\u201d said Kevin Vaughn, UCR University Extension dean. \u201cThrough our collaboration with multiple campuses, we will be able to serve students most in need throughout the state of California.\u201d\nInterested candidates can explore what each campus has to offer:\n\nUC Riverside: UCR University Extension\u00a0or can contact Marie C.
