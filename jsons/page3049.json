The system sends messages to the university community by e-mail, text message, and the Everbridge Mobile App. It also posts life-safety messages automatically to the main UC Davis Twitter account and UC Davis Facebook page. The system complements other UC Davis communications including use of the Web and news media.\nWhat is the campus Emergency Status Line? How do I reach it?\nThe campus Emergency Status Line provides callers with a recorded telephone message about the status of the campus in an emergency. In the event of an emergency, the recording indicates its nature, brief instructions and another source of information. Callers dial 530-752-4000.\nWhen a student has a problem at school, under which circumstances will UC Davis contact the parents?\nUnder university policy and federal and state law, students have privacy rights. There is no general exception for notifying parents unless the student has given written consent, or there is a serious concern about the health and welfare of the student. Exceptions may include transportation to the hospital for alcohol poisoning. But campus officials can only make that call if they know about the incident. If the situation doesn\u2019t come to the attention of the campus for several days, and a student is no longer in immediate danger, parents may not be contacted.\nCampus officials will usually contact parents if a student threatens or attempts suicide. If a student is removed from residence halls for misconduct and the student has nowhere to go, parents may also be notified.\nWhy can\u2019t I access my student\u2019s records?\nFederal regulations protect the privacy of student medical and educational records. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, sets safeguards around personal health information in the United States. While students can access their own health records, UC Davis cannot disclose information from health records to other individuals, even family members, without written authorization from the student. However, in a health or safety emergency, the university may share information with other people to protect the health or safety of the student or others.\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, puts similar measures in place for all records, including academic grades and health records, directly related to students. Like HIPAA, FERPA requires all public universities to obtain explicit, signed consent from the student for most disclosures of identifiable information from his or her educational record. Although parents have special rights under FERPA for K-12 education, the rights previously held by parents and guardians are transferred to the student upon enrollment in a UC Davis academic program. Some information \u2014 such as a student\u2019s major, dates of attendance and degree awarded \u2014 is considered public and can be disclosed unless the student has designated themselves \u201call records confidential.\u201d A student\u2019s telephone number and email address may be released unless the student has designated the record as \u201cdirectory confidential.\u201d For medical interns, less information is considered public.\n\n\n\n\n    Emergency Management\n  \n\nHow is the campus prepared for emergencies?\nUC Davis has a comprehensive emergency management program under the guidance of a full-time emergency planner. It includes a formal emergency operations plan for preparing for, responding to and recovering from emergencies. UC Davis uses an emergency operations center to coordinate response to major emergencies, and trained employees staff the center. UC Davis regularly conducts training sessions and emergency exercises. UC Davis is part of a regional emergency management system, and it is in compliance with state and federal standards for managing emergencies.\nHow is UC Davis served by police and fire?\nUC Davis has its own full-service police and fire departments located on campus. The\u00a0UC Davis Police Department\u00a0is a state police agency that provides patrol, investigative and crime prevention services on the Davis and Sacramento campuses. The department\u2019s jurisdiction extends one mile around the campus boundaries and to all facilities administered by UC Davis. The department has its main station on the Davis campus and one at the Sacramento campus.\nThe\u00a0UC Davis Fire Department\u00a0is responsible for fire\u00a0suppression, emergency medical services, hazardous materials response and rescue on the main campus in Davis. UC Davis also has automatic-aid agreements with local cities through which equipment and firefighters are automatically dispatched for certain incidents.\nHow does UC Davis handle campus closure?\nUC Davis policy provides for any temporary change to the status of campus operations due to an emergency event or hazardous condition. The campus may reduce or suspend non-critical functions and services or close facilities at one or more locations. Certain critical functions and services will be maintained to ensure the health and safety of the campus community and the operation of critical facilities, infrastructure and programs (e.g. healthcare and patient care, public safety functions, building maintenance, student housing and dining, and care of animals). UC Davis maintains a website with information related to campus closure, and there are academic policies and guidelines for canceled classes.\nHow does UC Davis respond to wildfire smoke events?\nDuring a wildfire smoke event, UC Davis makes decisions informed by public health best practices and scientific research. Based on recommendations from a UC systemwide review of air quality protocols, UC Davis has adopted a decision matrix and uses the U.S. EPA\u2019s AirNow Current Conditions AQI as its official source of air quality data. The matrix outlines required and recommended actions regarding campus closure, cancellation of classes, athletic events, and other operational considerations. UC Davis\u2019 plan also addresses the maintenance of HVAC systems in campus buildings and accommodations for outdoor workers at different levels of air quality. UC Davis maintains a website with information related to wildfire smoke and campus closure.\nIs UC Davis prepared to deal with a shooter on campus?\nIt\u2019s something we hope doesn\u2019t happen here, but we know it could. Since the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007, all UC Davis police officers have completed training in active shooter/rapid response and related equipment has been purchased. While it was once standard for law enforcement to set up a perimeter and wait for a specially trained and equipped SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) team to arrive, the active shooter procedures call for teams of trained officers to move in immediately and neutralize the shooter. The department holds\u00a0training sessions\u00a0to help members of the campus community to think ahead and learn strategies to increase the likelihood of surviving a shooting incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Crime Prevention and Risk Reduction\n  \n\nHow does UC Davis help the community prevent crime?\nThe UC Davis Police Department works to reduce crime through community education. It provides crime prevention resources including written guidelines and tip sheets as well as presentations on topics such as personal safety, office and facility security, workplace violence, suspicious package recognition and others as requested.\nAll students are encouraged to take precautions for their personal safety and attend presentations on personal safety and security that are offered in the residence halls. Members of the campus community should also protect their personal property by registering their bikes, locking computers to their desk, and engraving valuables with their student identification or driver\u2019s license number.\nHow does UC Davis help reduce incidents of sexual assault and serve survivors?\nEstablished in 1979, the\u00a0Center for Advocacy Resources and Education\u00a0(CARE) is the on-campus, confidential resource for students, staff and faculty who have experienced any form of sexual violence, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, domestic or dating violence, and stalking. It provides 24/7 emergency response, crisis intervention and support services. It also offers support and guidance to family members, friends and others concerned about the survivor. CARE also works to reduce sexual violence through primary prevention, education and awareness.\nDoes UC Davis offer self-defense classes?\n\u00a0Campus Recreation offers self-defense classes, and the UC Davis Police Department offers\u00a0self-defense training.\nWhat does UC Davis do about hazing?\nUC Davis is committed to ending hazing on our campus.\u00a0Hazing is taken extremely seriously, and there are university policies and processes in place to address hazing incidents when they occur. Campus policy encourages and empowers anyone who has witnessed hazing, been hazed or suspects that someone they know has been hazed to report this to a university official. A Stop Hazing website offers information about hazing, how to report incidents, support services, and ideas for positive ways to bring groups together.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n    Safety in Residence Halls\n  \n\nWhat kind of security does UC Davis have in the residence halls?\nResidence halls are locked 24 hours a day and feature an electronic key-card access system for exterior entrances. Access is limited to the residents of the hall and their invited guests so that the resident community collectively controls and limits access to their building. Video cameras are located at most entry points, bike parking locations and certain other areas. Each bedroom has its own dead bolt lock and a peephole in the door, and first-floor bedrooms\u00a0have window security screens. The residence halls have live-in resident advisers, and someone is on call at all times.\nAll of our residence halls are equipped with sprinkler systems. Two\u00a0full-time staff are dedicated to testing and maintaining fire alarm systems, smoke and heat detectors and\u00a0fire extinguishers.\n\n\n\n\n    Alcohol and Other Drugs\n  \n\nWhat is UC Davis doing to prevent problems related to alcohol and other drugs?\nFor years, UC Davis has had campus policies and programs to address the use and abuse of alcohol and other drugs among its students. Efforts include policy development, educational programming, intervention and enforcement. The campuswide effort includes, among others, Student Housing, Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS), and the Associated Students of UC Davis (ASUCD).\nThe university facilitates the Davis Alcohol and Other Drug Advisory Group. The group examines issues affecting youth and their families and develops, promotes and supports university and community policies and educational strategies that prevent or reduce alcohol and drug abuse and its consequences.\nDoes UC Davis have a medical amnesty protocol?\nAggies Act is the UC Davis medical amnesty protocol that allows students to call for medical help without fear of disciplinary action from the university in situations involving drugs or alcohol. The protocol is available to students as long as they have not concurrently committed other Student Conduct Code violations and have not used the protocol within two years. Instead of having a disciplinary file opened, a student using the protocol must complete an assigned activity related to drug or alcohol education.\nA lot of college students run into problems at parties. How is UC Davis addressing that?\nThe\u00a0Safe Party Initiative\u00a0works to create safer party environments by building a closer sense of community between students and neighbors, promoting safety at parties, and increasing enforcement of alcohol-related laws and policies. This initiative is a collaboration of the city of Davis and UC Davis.\nDoes UC Davis have an office devoted to prevention of problems related to alcohol and other drug use?\nEstablished in 1990,\u00a0Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Intervention Services\u00a0offers educational programs, employs strategies to create safer environments and provides resources and referrals for treatment. As part of the Health Education and Promotion program, the program aims to reduce alcohol and other drug-related barriers to academic and social development.\n\n\n\n\n    Mental Health Issues\n  \n\nWhat services does UC Davis have for students with mental health problems?\nStudent Health and Counseling Services (SHCS) offers confidential and free assessment, intervention and referral for students, and consultation and crisis response for employees, students and parents. Other programs \u2014 including new faculty orientation, conferences and workshops \u2014 provide guidance in identifying and responding to distressed or distressing students.\nWhat mental health services are available for students outside regular business hours?\nAfter-hours counseling services consultations are available to UC Davis students or others (e.g., friends, family members, staff, faculty) concerned about a UC Davis student for psychological crisis assessment, consultation and intervention during evening and weekend hours and on holidays when Counseling Services is closed. Those seeking this service can call 530-752-2349 and follow the automated menu (press #1 then #5) for assistance connecting with a live counselor.\nWhere can faculty and staff find resources to help a distressed student?\nUC Davis\u2019 Red Folder acts as a quick-reference guide that faculty and staff can use during interactions with students who display distress or distressing behavior. The Red Folder lists emergency and non-emergency contact information as well as specialized resources for a variety of scenarios. The goal of the guide is to promote safe, sensitive and collaborative responses to support students in crisis.\nWhat does UC Davis do in the case of a student death?\nUC Davis has guidelines that emphasize family, student and community support in the case of a sudden student death. The plan, called \u201cPostvention,\u201d aims to provide sensitive support and communication to students, family, and the campus community at large in a way that limits the risk of additional events like suicides. UC Davis provides staff and faculty with resources and recommendations to aid them in communicating with students throughout their grieving process. Our guidelines address the availability and coordination of memorial services and counseling for friends and family, and they outline how academic accommodations can be made for grieving students.\nWhat kinds of counseling services are available to employees?\nThe Academic and Staff Assistance Program (ASAP) offers confidential and free assessment, counseling, consultation and referral services to all UC Davis and UC Davis Health faculty, staff and families. The assistance program helps with problems whether they are work-related or personal, administrative or individual, or career or relationship focused.\nWhen additional resources are needed, we can link you to appropriate services in your community. If you are concerned about a friend, colleague, co-worker, subordinate or work group, we can help you. Our goal is to help at the earliest possible moment.\nASAP on the Davis Campus: 530-752-2727\nASAP on the Sacramento Campus:\u00a0916-734-2727\nHow does UC Davis deal with students or employees whose problems might get out of hand?\nAt UC Davis, the Student Crisis Response Team provides immediate and comprehensive response to situations that involve disruption, intimidation or violence. The team develops and implements strategic interventions and helps manage ongoing problems. Related services include the\u00a0Center for Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE) and\u00a0workplace violence information and resources.\n\n\n\n\n    Crime Statistics\n  \n\nDoes UC Davis publish crime statistics?\nThe UC Davis Police Department has a Transparency Dashboard. Among other information, the department publishes online crime alerts, daily crime logs and monthly campus crime reports. The Jeanne Cleary Act Annual Security and Fire Safety Report provides information about safety and security policies implemented to protect the welfare of the campus community and statistics for crimes that occurred on campus; in certain off-campus buildings; and property owned, leased, or controlled by the university. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSub Main Menu\n\n\n\nAdministration\n\n\n\n\nInitiatives\n\n\nPrinciples and Policies\n\n\nTop Administrative Units\n\n\nOrg chart\n\n\n\nStaff Resources\n\n\n\n\nComputing Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\n\nRankings\n\n\n\nLocations\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Middle of Everywhere\n\n\n\n\nBay Area day trips\n\n\nBeach day trips\n\n\nSierra Nevada day trips\n\n\nWine country day trips\n\n\n\n\n\nTransportation\n\n\n\n\nJoin 'Team Bike'\n\n\n\n\nUnique to UC Davis\n\n\n\n\nSustainability\n\n\n\nVisit UC Davis\n\n\n\n\nCampus Tour\n\n\nCampus Tour\n\n\nPlan your visit\n\n\nDirections and Parking\n\n\n\nTour Guides\n\n\n\n\nAlayna Davidson '23\n\n\nJack Crandall '23\n\n\nJojo Carusa '24\n\n\nMichelle Lester '22\n\n\nNathan Le '23\n\n\nChristina Saunders '23\n\n\nCoral Pongsuwan '24\n\n\nJenna Heath '23\n\n\nJoe Sweeney '24\n\n\nJoelle Suh '23\n\n\nJojo Carusa \u201823\n\n\nKailyn Healey '23\n\n\nMichelle Lester \u201823\n\n\nMissy Zepeda '24\n\n\nNeshmia Alam '23\n\n\nRachel Lucine '23\n\n\nRay Fields '24\n\n\nRiley Mann '24\n\n\nRyan Taylor '24\n\n\nZoe Brumbaugh '24\n\n\n\n\nWelcome Center\n\n\nVirtual Tour\n\n\n\n\nUC Davis Health\n\n\n\nCampus Safety\n\n\n\n\nEmergencies and FAQs\n\n\n\nHelp\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUC Davis\n\n\nUC Davis Health\n\n\nVeterinary Medicine\n\n\nUC Davis Continuing and Professional Education\n\n\nUC Davis Stores\n\n\nUC Davis Arts\n\n\nUC Davis Mobile Apps\n\n\nHiring UC Davis Students and Alumni\n\n\nMake a Gift to UC Davis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents\n\n\nOrientation\n\n\nStudent Resources\n\n\nGraduate Students\n\n\nStudent Parents\n\n\nCommencement\n\n\nInternship and Career Center\n\n\nJobs and Internships\n\n\nParents\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni\n\n\nCal Aggie Alumni Association\n\n\nCareer Connections\n\n\nMember Benefits\n\n\nTranscripts\n\n\nUC Davis Magazine\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty\n\n\nResources\n\n\nTeaching\n\n\nResearch\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\nFaculty Governance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaff\n\n\nResources\n\n\nTraining\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\nJobs\n\n\nStaff Assembly\n\n\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of California, Davis, One Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616 | 530-752-1011\n\nQuestions or comments?
