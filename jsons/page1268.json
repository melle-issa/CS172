Often wry and satirical, she writes with a powerfully determined voice about women, writing, and travel. Her most recent publication, The Romance of Elsewhere (Counterpoint Press), is a collection of essays about intense wanderlust and the struggle of defining \u201chome.\u201d Lynn says the central question of the collection is \u201cwhere or what is home?\u2019 To which I\u2019d have to say, nowhere.\u201d She continues, \u201cWhich is not to say there aren\u2019t places in which I feel at home\u2014Greece, for instance, and the African bush. I also feel at home in the past. And yet there is also a certain liberation in being untied from the past\u2014from the bonds of home. And a sadness, a great sadness. As you see, I\u2019m still looking for an answer.\u201d\nFreed grew up in Durban, South Africa, and moved to New York as a graduate student to study English Literature at Columbia University. She is Professor Emerita of English at the University of California in Davis and has published numerous, award-winning works in fiction and nonfiction. Her most recent novel is The Last Laugh (Sarah Crichton Books), about a group of older women who flee their previous lives by moving to a Greek island\u2014something many of us have fantasized about. It delves into what freedom really entails and the dynamic complexity of friendships between women.\nOn writing, Lynn says \u201cleaving home is perhaps the central experience of the writer\u2019s life. The restless pursuit of a way back while remaining steadfastly at a distance \u2014 this is the enigma that informs the writer\u2019s perspective.\u201d By her own account she is neither fast nor disciplined as a writer. She says \u201cI\u2019m hard put to know which obsess me. The cult of the self? The self-promotion, selfies, self-this, self-that to which we\u2019re all subjected? Old age? Grown children?\u2026Something will come up, or nothing. If nothing, I\u2019ll try not to force something onto the page.\u201d The result is prose full of candor and wit that looks deeply at what it means to be a woman and what it means to be a writer.\nTo read more about Lynn Freed and her writing, check out this interview on The Rumpus.\nPlease join us for a thought-provoking evening with Lynn Freed this Thursday, November 1st at 7:30 pm in\u00a0Zingg Recital Hall (ARTS 150). Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, Writer\u2019s Voice readings are free and open to the public.\nWritten by Alyssa Cox\n\n \n\nOctober 29, 2018watershedcsuc CSUC, fiction, Lynn Freed, nonfiction, Writer's Voice Reading Series\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nWriter\u2019s Voice Spotlight: Rob\u00a0Davidson \n\n\nOur next author for Writer\u2019s Voice is our very own Rob Davidson, professor of creative writing and American literature at Chico State. Rob will be reading from his newest publication Spectators: Flash Fictions (Five Oaks Press, 2017). Kirkus Reviews has praised Spectators as \u201cA small but mighty collection of textual snapshots\u2026 Flash fiction at its best that\u2019s definitely worth a look.\u201d Indeed, the collection of micro wonders has been nominated for Pulitzer Prize.\nRob talks about his writing process for Spectators in The Story Prize. The collection was inspired by photography and visual art of Stephani Schaefer, Sara G. Umemoto, and Tom Patton. He started off with ekphrastic exercises, simply literary responses to artistic production before trimming each piece down. This process, as I recalled Rob saying at his first reading at Arabica Caf\u00e9 downtown Chico, allowed him to realize what was essential. By compacting each piece to less than a page, truly, each word is important and every line shines.\nThis work moves from the lyrical to the narrative and to the meta, reminding us that, just like memories, we may not remember moments in their entirety. We remember only certain instances or details. Rob expertly draws out those kinds of details to ground us in familiarity, something different, and gifts us with something we had not quite noticed before. After all, \u201cWe are spectators\u2026We exist both to observe and be observed.\u201d\nDavidson\u2019s previous story collections are The Farther Shore (Bear Star, 2012) and Field Observations (Missouri, 2001). He is also the author of a monograph, The Master and the Dean: The Literary Criticism of Henry James and William Dean Howells (Missouri, 2005). His fiction, essays and interviews have appeared in Zyzzyva, Hayden\u2019s Ferry Review, Indiana Review, New Delta Review, South Dakota Review, and elsewhere. Davidson\u2019s honors include a Fulbright U.S. Senior Scholar award to lecture in Taiwan (2015-2016), the Camber Press fiction award, judged by Ron Carlson, and an AWP Intro Journals Project Award in fiction.\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Rob Davidson, this Thursday at 7:30 pm Colusa 100B.

This story is also part of Fioravanti\u2019s second linked collection, Bridge & Tunnel.\n\u201cLoud Love\u201d was a pleasure to read. The main character is a riot, endearingly imperfect and human, with a proclivity for hysterical honesty. All of the characterizations are complex and unique in a plot that keeps us engaged. The narrative tone in \u201cLoud Love\u201d is realistic and believable, with a tongue-in-cheek attitude that enfolds a story, not just entertaining, but meaningful as well.\nFioravanti is the author of the linked collection of short stories titled Garbage Night at the Opera, winner of the 2011 Sharat Chandra Prize for Short Fiction. Her published short stories have earned a total of six Pushcart Prize nominations and a Special Mention in Pushcart Prize XXVIII. Currently, Fioravanti lives in Sacramento, California, where she works primarily as a creative writing coach and leader of writing workshops.\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Valerie Fioravanti, Thursday at 7:30 pm in Colusa 100B.

After the hard work of researching literary magazines, completing our editorial process and collecting all the pieces that will comprise the upcoming issue of Watershed Review, we\u2019re feeling ready to switch gears. Here, Sarah Pape walks students through some examples from last semester.\n\u00a0\n\nLooking through various examples of letterpress broadsides, as well as \u201chandmade\u201d versions of peer\u2019s work, English 415 students begin to think about choices they will make for their own. We consider the relationships between image, type, layout, paper, and color.\n\nIn English 415, we cover a lot of ground, reading about the history of literary publication, the social and artistic importance of those early efforts, as well as the present day innovators in online publication. To get a better sense of the machines and processes necessary to produce early literary publications, we headed to a local letterpress studio, Wild Ink Press, where they produce sundry paper products\u2013from cards to coasters to art prints.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nUpon arrival, Wild Ink\u2019s pressman, Rik Pape, gave students a thorough overview of the parts and procedures involved in making a letterpress print. Here, he brings out examples of copper plates used for embossing.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWild Ink\u2019s main workhorses (besides their dedicated owners and staff) are the\u00a0Heidelberg Windmill presses. Nicknamed \u201cThe Prince of Presses,\u201d when this one kicked into gear, we stood back in awe of the precision and power behind the whirring mechanics.\n\u00a0\n\nBetween ink color, locking the plate and calibrating for the exact imprint, Rik shows the class how little room for error there is when setting up a job. On this particular day, he was working on a custom Christmas card.\n\u00a0\n\nWe were given a sample print to inspect, looking specifically at the high quality cotton paper and how the silver ink creates a opalescent effect.\nWe learned so much on our field trip to Wild Ink Press. Most notably, we left with a genuine sense of wonder and admiration for those early publishers of literary works, laboring over handset type and big iron presses to bring those voices we now take for granted into the world for the first time.\nThough we will be working with hand-carved blocks, brayers and a typewriter for our foray into broadside prints, we hope to import some of the precision, intention and beauty that resides in the Wild Ink products we explored.\nThank you to Matt and Rebekah Tennis for allowing us to visit during their preparations for the opening of Wild Ink Press\u2019 new studio/shop space. Thanks, too, to Rik Pape for the tour of inks, plates, type and presses.\nPhotos by Sylvia Bowersox and Sarah Pape.\n\n\nNovember 23, 2014watershedcsuc CSUC, Letterpress, Literary Editing & Publishing, literary publication, Sarah Pape, Wild Ink Press\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nWriter\u2019s Voice Spotlight: Wendy C.\u00a0Ortiz \n\n\nCSU, Chico Writer\u2019s Voice is proud to present author, Wendy C. Ortiz, Thursday November 6th at 7:30pm in Colusa 100A.\nRecently, I picked up a copy of Excavation: A Memoir by Wendy C. Ortiz and was unable to put it down until I reached the end. In Excavation, Ortiz narrates the years-long relationship that she had with a teacher, starting when she was 13 years old. Her memoir flips the script on how society dictates someone in her position should act. In an interview with Hector Tobar in the LA Times, Ortiz says, \u201cI\u2019m writing about something that people prefer to see as black and white, but I really want to expose the grays.\u201d The grays emerge in the way that her story is told, unapologetic and never shying away from taboo. Her story is about much more than her relationship with her teacher. It is also a coming of age story about a girl who is trying to find her place in the world. The raw and at times uncomfortably honest story kept me turning each page.\nMemoir often relies on a dual perspective\u2013the voice of innocence and the voice of experience. In Ortiz\u2019 book, she accomplished this through mining journals from those years the relationship was happening and by creating formal elements that contain the adult perspective. While reading you feel as if you are inside the mind of teenage Ortiz as she is experiencing these events and grappling with what it all means. The soundtrack to this time in her life can be heard in the background with her use of song titles and lyrics to describe her moods. The second voice comes from the present-day Ortiz as she performs an archaeological dig on her past. This is the voice of experience that questions and tries to make sense of what happened. Those moments are presented as \u201cNotes on an Excavation.\u201d\nThe upcoming issue of Watershed Review will also feature a short creative nonfiction piece from Ortiz titled \u201cMud Myths.\u201d It is a unique piece that stood out from the other nonfiction pieces because it is written in the third person. Like Excavation: A Memoir, the language in this story is very lyrical. We are honored to have a piece of her work to include in our Fall issue.\nWendy C. Ortiz is the author of Excavation: A Memoir (Future Tense Books, 2014) and the forthcoming Hollywood Notebook (Writ Large Press, spring 2015). She wrote the year-long, monthly column \u201cOn the Trail of Mary Jane\u201d for McSweeney\u2019s Internet Tendency. Her work has appeared in the New York Times, Vol. 1 Brooklyn, The Nervous Breakdown, and The Rumpus, among many other places. Wendy is co-founder, curator, and host of the decade-old Rhapsodomancy Reading Series. She is a registered marriage and family therapist intern in Los Angeles.\nCheck out her website and her Tumblr to read more about her current projects.\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Wendy C. Ortiz, Thursday, November 6th at 7:30 pm in Colusa 100A.

Ortiz, Writer's Voice\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nWriter\u2019s Voice Spotlight: Doug\u00a0Rice \n\n\nCSU, Chico Writer\u2019s Voice is proud to present author, Doug Rice, Thursday, October 23rd at 7:30 pm in Langdon 300. Rice has authored more than a half dozen books including Between Appear and Disappear, Dream Memoirs of a Fabulist, A Good Cuntboy is Hard to Find, and his first novel, Blood of Mugwump that was selected by Kathy Acker as a runner-up for the FC2 First Novel Award. He has been published in numerous literary journals, anthologies, and magazines including Avant Pop: Fiction for a Daydream Nation, Biting the Error, Discourse, Zyzzyva, and Gargoyle.\nDoug Rice earned his BA in English from Slippery Rock State College, a MA in creative writing at SUNY-Binghamton, a MA in English Literature at Duquesne University, and studied for his PhD in Literature at the University of Pittsburgh. He spent some earlier years teaching at La Roche College and Kent State University-Salem and is currently teaching Creative Writing, literary theory, and film history and theory at Sacramento State University. He is also an artist-in-residence at the Akademie Schloss Solitude, Stuttgart, Germany. His work has been translated into Polish, Spanish, French, Portuguese, and German.\nRice will be reading from his two recent publications, Dream Memoirs of a Fabulist and Between Appear and Disappear, as well as showing work from his book When Love Was. Though the genre distinction \u201cmemoir\u201d is used in title and description of his more recent work, it is far from the traditional notion we are drawn to when we hear that word. These books share and explore the story through text and photograph, between narrative and poem. Threads of identity and relationship between individuals are layered upon the relationship between the author to the words on the page with consideration to the reader being an integral part of the pages, words, photos, and structure in the landscape of the physical book itself. Rice wants the reader to be aware of the importance of their interaction with what he is offering in the conjunction between story and art.\nWhen asked about Rice\u2019s more recent work, Professor Paul Eggers said, \u201cHe\u2019s unlike any other writer we\u2019ve brought to campus, in that he\u2019s avant-garde. Though his two latest books are called \u201cmemoir,\u201d they represent, to my mind, the farthest reaches of what you can do and still call something in the realm of memoir. His work combines narrative\u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible with Doug to further classify it as fiction or nonfiction\u2014photography and even, in the case of Dream Memoirs, incorporating a tactile element to the act of reading. I think it\u2019s fair to say that he attempts to break down our habitual distinctions between self and other, between gendered identities, between memory and reality, and between language and the material world.\u201d\nFor a peek into his handmade book, Dream Memoirs of a Fabulist, check out this video about his collaboration with Stephanie Sauer of Copilot Press.\nHere he discusses his unique approach to storytelling\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Doug Rice, Thursday, October 23rd at 7:30 pm in Langdon 300.

Allred is the author of three poetry collections, Whetstone, winner of the Flume Press Chapbook award, Particulate (Bear Star Press), and The Evolutionary Purpose of Heartbreak (Turning Point Books). Allred spent many years teaching in the English department at CSU, Chico, and currently lives just outside of Chico with her husband, dogs, and a few chickens.\nAllred\u2019s work delves deeply into the human condition and explores the interconnectivity between the self and nature. Her words are a quiet meditation on living, loving, and losing. She often takes something ordinary and reveals its extraordinary essence by using metaphoric language to zero in on a specific experience or emotion. The speaker of her poems is often an observational one that acts as a guide into this meditation and connection to nature. Her poem \u201cPlum in Early Spring,\u201d from Whetstone, for instance, does this:\nFor three rainy weeks my plum tree\nkeeps a thousand small fists.\nThen one warm day it explodes.\nThe sweet tethered cloud blazes\nangel white, innocent of consequence,\nnot caring for how long the rain\nhas gone or if frost lurks\na few days away. The blooms don\u2019t inquire\nhave the hives dried, will bees be out\nin time to nuzzle their open hearts.\n\u00a0\nUnconcerned with plans for harvest\nthey ignore my pleas to be patient, to reflect\nbefore taking an irrevocable step.\nTrees simply answer the season\u2019s necessity,\nunable to deny the spirit\nmoving through by drawing silly\ndistinctions between the self and soul.\nThis poem begins with the simple image of a plum tree, but as the poem progresses a parallel between what is happening to this tree and what sometimes happens with humans emerges\u2013a sudden burst of inspiration and an urge to follow one\u2019s desires, to be wild in spirit without stopping too long to think about it, to \u201csimply answer to the season\u2019s necessity.\u201d This poem also unveils the yearning and sometimes impatience humans have to control the natural world, which cannot be contained. Even though this poem starts off simply, it makes leaps to ultimately arrive at something much larger.\nPlease join us for a lovely evening with Joanne Harris Allred, Thursday, April 10th at 7:30 pm in Colousa 100B.
