The year-long construction project will triple the size of the museum, including additional galleries, event spaces, a caf\u00e9 and a research library.\nSince opening in 2016, the Hilbert Museum has established itself as one of the leading art museums in Southern California, attracting more than 30,000 visitors annually, and has been named as one of the best museums in Orange County by OC Weekly and the Los Angeles Times. The museum\u2019s collection features thousands of California Scene paintings donated by museum founders Mark and Janet Hlibert, and includes collections of animation, movie art and American illustration.\n\u201cThe Hilbert Museum serves both Chapman University and our larger Orange community in so many ways,\u201d City of Orange Mayor Dan Slater said at the groundbreaking. \u201cThis museum has become not just a showcase for the paintings on its walls, but also a meeting place for all the arts \u2014 its rich programming schedule presents talks, films, performances and more. It has become Orange\u2019s de facto cultural living room where local arts lovers gather.\u201d\nThe museum is expected to reopen early in 2024. Until then, visitors can see special exhibitions and highlights from the Hilbert Collection at a temporary location near Orange Plaza.
