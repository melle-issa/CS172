Williams on Thursday, April 6th.\nWe are proud to host a reading of Williams\u2019 debut novel, Landfalls. A captivating integration of fiction and history, Landfalls tells the story of the star-crossed expeditions of the French ships Boussole and Astrolabe in 1785. Told through the perspectives of sailors, native peoples, family members, and many others, the ships\u2019 journeys give an imagined voice to a little known history.\nA native of Japan, Naomi Williams spoke no English until she was six years old. Her writing has been featured in Zoetrope: All-Story,\u00a0A Public Space,\u00a0One Story, The Southern Review, The Gettysburg Review and even earned her a Pushcart Prize. Williams holds a MA in creative writing from UC Davis, where she now teaches. As well, she serves as co-director of the literary series\u00a0Stories on Stage Davis. Landfalls has been long-listed for the Center for Fiction First Novel Prize and the National Book Critics Circle\u2019s John Leonard Award.\nWhen asked what inspired Landfalls, Williams tells interviewers that the idea came from an old map of the Lap\u00e9rouse expedition given to her by her husband. This stirred her idea for a multi-narrative collection of stories that would build the expedition from \u201cvoices we don\u2019t usually hear.\u201d Williams writes extensively of the map and how it inspired her on her blog.\nWilliams\u2019 debut work has been praised for her research and historical accuracy. She challenged herself to veer from the historical narrative as little a possible and found creative inspiration in the historical accounts. It is no doubt she is a lover of history and it shows through her profound retelling of the Lap\u00e9rouse expedition.\nReading Landfalls will reopen your eyes to history and leave you wondering how your favorite historical figures, and the people around them, felt at crucial points in the past, or pondering what inspired them to do what they did. Williams\u2019 own exploratory instinct links her and her historical characters in Landfalls. Her wonder-filled story may awaken your own investigative impulse and guide your future reading experience. Williams is currently hard at work on several writing projects, including a novel based on the early 20th-century Japanese poet Yosano Akiko.\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Naomi J. Williams, Thursday at 7:30 pm in the Zingg Recital Hall (ARTS 150). Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, Writer\u2019s Voice readings are free and open to the public.\nBy Kennedi Turner\nRead an Excerpt and Interview \nRead a New York Times Book Review\n\n \n\nApril 5, 2017watershedcsuc\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll\n\nDiscuss\nGet Inspired\nGet Polling\nGet Support\nLearn WordPress.com\nTheme Showcase\nWordPress Planet\nWordPress.com News\n\n\nTopics\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nUpcoming Events No upcoming events\nArchives\n\nMay 2022\nMarch 2022\nMay 2020\nOctober 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nOctober 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nApril 2017\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nDecember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nApril 2014\nFebruary 2014\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nAugust 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\n\n \n\nFollow me on TwitterMy Tweets \n\n\n\n\nCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
