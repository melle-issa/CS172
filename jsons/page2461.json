(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nThese are the emissions a new program led by Randy Livingston, vice president for Business Affairs, has begun systematically to tackle, not only to help Stanford reach its goal but also to establish a path for other institutions and for the more than 100 companies that have pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2040.\n\u201cWe have a lot of work to do,\u201d Livingston said. \u201cWe have to define the emissions categories, determine how to measure them, count our own emissions in each category, and identify and implement mitigations.\u201d\nHe added that many university campuses, businesses and governments are increasingly focused on this work as the risks of climate change become more apparent, but little exists as a framework for measuring Scope 3 emissions, much less for reducing them.\nDefining emissions\n\n\nThis Scope 3 work is on part of a larger effort at Stanford to create a more sustainable campus and develop solutions that can help others reach sustainability goals. As part of that, the university had previously committed to use 100% renewable energy sources and to have greenhouse gas emissions levels at 80% below peak by 2025, goals the university will reach when a new solar installation goes online in 2022.\nThese campus sustainability efforts, and others that address water use, waste and individual action, helped the university achieve a Platinum ranking from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education \u2013 one of nine universities to earn that ranking out of more than one thousand members.\n\n\nThe first step for Livingston\u2019s team is defining what Scope 3 emissions are on a university campus. The most commonly used protocol for defining Scope 3 emissions includes 15 categories that encompass business travel, employee commuting, purchased goods and services, facility construction, campus leaseholders and properties outside the main campus, among others. But although those categories are defined, the standard definitions don\u2019t always apply to campuses. For example, business travel would generally include travel for meetings or conferences, but universities also have students traveling to come to school.\n\u201cStudent travel is akin to employee travel, but it isn\u2019t defined in the protocol,\u201d said Moira Zbella, program manager for the Scope 3 Emissions Program. Zbella also pointed to other aspects of campus life that are unique to university emissions, such as the abundance of dorm mini-fridges chilling late-night study snacks.\nA running start\nLivingston said that an early goal for the program is to update the standard definitions for each of the 15 categories to include university activities. Some of the categories are well defined for a university campus, Livingston said, but others are lagging.\n\n\n\n\nStanford\u2019s Long-Range Vision lays out the future direction for the university\u2019s research, education and impact.\nRead\u00a0our updates about those initiatives and their progress.\n\n\nNext, the team will adopt or develop methodologies for measuring emissions in each of the categories. As with definitions, some already have standard ways of measuring emissions while others are just getting started.\nFor example, Stanford and some other universities have started exploring ways to measure emissions from purchasing food for dining halls, and Stanford graduate student Rebecca Grekin is developing a tool other campuses or businesses can use to calculate those emissions in a consistent way. Ultimately, the work on food purchasing with R&DE Stanford Dining could inform best practices for tracking emissions from all campus purchasing.\n\u201cThe Office of Sustainability has already initiated work on several categories that will give us a running start,\u201d Zbella said. Those categories that are further behind, she said, will be good research opportunities for faculty and students.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to attack the categories in parallel over many years,\u201d Livingston said.\nAs the group develops ways of measuring and tracking emissions, they plan to release data on Stanford emissions in each category at least yearly. And as it becomes possible to track emissions over time, Zbella hopes to develop data-driven mitigations for each category.\nFor example, Zbella is working with R&DE Stanford Dining and a group of interested students \u2013 in conjunction with research being led by the Menus of Change University Research Collaborative \u2013 to understand if and how carbon labels influence food choices in dining halls. Other potential mitigations could include initiatives to reduce or offset business travel or incorporate sustainability into purchasing contracts. Long-term, the team will weigh the anticipated emissions impacts of these types of measures against economic and user experience considerations to inform a long-term plan.\nIn the meantime, some personal Scope 3 mitigations are integrated into MyCardinal Green, an opt-in program to help the Stanford community live more sustainably. Over time Livingston\u2019s group will\u00a0recommend more personal actions to be added to the platform.\nLivingston and Zbella said they expect to collaborate with other Stanford groups working on sustainability issues, including the Office of Sustainability, the new school focused on climate and sustainability and the Office of Community Engagement, which can help identify community partners to develop and test possible solutions. They are also working closely with a group of peer universities each addressing Scope 3 emissions to reach their own campus goals.\n\n\nMoira Zbella, program manager, said individuals looking to make a difference now could consider the following:\n\nUse the\u00a0Climate Pledge Friendly filter\u00a0when shopping on Amazon for Business \u2013 this filter shows only products that meet sustainability certifications and standards.\nThink twice about flying: consider attending events virtually or taking another mode of transportation if the event location is close enough.\nReduce meat consumption: reducing meat \u2013 and particularly beef \u2013 consumption is one of the most impactful ways to reduce your carbon footprint. When eating on campus, choose one of the many tasty, plant-forward options prepared by\u00a0R&DE Stanford Dining.

Recycling and composting reduce emissions not only by saving space in landfills, but also through the avoided extraction of raw materials for new goods.
