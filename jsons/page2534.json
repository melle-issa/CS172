Often wry and satirical, she writes with a powerfully determined voice about women, writing, and travel. Her most recent publication, The Romance of Elsewhere (Counterpoint Press), is a collection of essays about intense wanderlust and the struggle of defining \u201chome.\u201d Lynn says the central question of the collection is \u201cwhere or what is home?\u2019 To which I\u2019d have to say, nowhere.\u201d She continues, \u201cWhich is not to say there aren\u2019t places in which I feel at home\u2014Greece, for instance, and the African bush. I also feel at home in the past. And yet there is also a certain liberation in being untied from the past\u2014from the bonds of home. And a sadness, a great sadness. As you see, I\u2019m still looking for an answer.\u201d\nFreed grew up in Durban, South Africa, and moved to New York as a graduate student to study English Literature at Columbia University. She is Professor Emerita of English at the University of California in Davis and has published numerous, award-winning works in fiction and nonfiction. Her most recent novel is The Last Laugh (Sarah Crichton Books), about a group of older women who flee their previous lives by moving to a Greek island\u2014something many of us have fantasized about. It delves into what freedom really entails and the dynamic complexity of friendships between women.\nOn writing, Lynn says \u201cleaving home is perhaps the central experience of the writer\u2019s life. The restless pursuit of a way back while remaining steadfastly at a distance \u2014 this is the enigma that informs the writer\u2019s perspective.\u201d By her own account she is neither fast nor disciplined as a writer. She says \u201cI\u2019m hard put to know which obsess me. The cult of the self? The self-promotion, selfies, self-this, self-that to which we\u2019re all subjected? Old age? Grown children?\u2026Something will come up, or nothing. If nothing, I\u2019ll try not to force something onto the page.\u201d The result is prose full of candor and wit that looks deeply at what it means to be a woman and what it means to be a writer.\nTo read more about Lynn Freed and her writing, check out this interview on The Rumpus.\nPlease join us for a thought-provoking evening with Lynn Freed this Thursday, November 1st at 7:30 pm in\u00a0Zingg Recital Hall (ARTS 150).

This story is also part of Fioravanti\u2019s second linked collection, Bridge & Tunnel.\n\u201cLoud Love\u201d was a pleasure to read. The main character is a riot, endearingly imperfect and human, with a proclivity for hysterical honesty. All of the characterizations are complex and unique in a plot that keeps us engaged. The narrative tone in \u201cLoud Love\u201d is realistic and believable, with a tongue-in-cheek attitude that enfolds a story, not just entertaining, but meaningful as well.\nFioravanti is the author of the linked collection of short stories titled Garbage Night at the Opera, winner of the 2011 Sharat Chandra Prize for Short Fiction. Her published short stories have earned a total of six Pushcart Prize nominations and a Special Mention in Pushcart Prize XXVIII. Currently, Fioravanti lives in Sacramento, California, where she works primarily as a creative writing coach and leader of writing workshops.\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Valerie Fioravanti, Thursday at 7:30 pm in Colusa 100B. Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, Writer\u2019s Voice readings are free and open to the public.\nBy Heather Stogsdill\n\n\n \n\nSeptember 19, 2016watershedcsuc CSUC, fiction, Valerie Fioravanti, Writer's Voice Reading Series\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nWriter\u2019s Voice Spotlight: Joanne Harris\u00a0Allred \n\n\nChico State Writer\u2019s Voice is proud to present poet, Joanne Harris Allred, on Thursday, April 10, 2014 at 7:30 PM in Colusa 100B. Allred is the author of three poetry collections, Whetstone, winner of the Flume Press Chapbook award, Particulate (Bear Star Press), and The Evolutionary Purpose of Heartbreak (Turning Point Books). Allred spent many years teaching in the English department at CSU, Chico, and currently lives just outside of Chico with her husband, dogs, and a few chickens.\nAllred\u2019s work delves deeply into the human condition and explores the interconnectivity between the self and nature. Her words are a quiet meditation on living, loving, and losing. She often takes something ordinary and reveals its extraordinary essence by using metaphoric language to zero in on a specific experience or emotion. The speaker of her poems is often an observational one that acts as a guide into this meditation and connection to nature. Her poem \u201cPlum in Early Spring,\u201d from Whetstone, for instance, does this:\nFor three rainy weeks my plum tree\nkeeps a thousand small fists.\nThen one warm day it explodes.\nThe sweet tethered cloud blazes\nangel white, innocent of consequence,\nnot caring for how long the rain\nhas gone or if frost lurks\na few days away. The blooms don\u2019t inquire\nhave the hives dried, will bees be out\nin time to nuzzle their open hearts.\n\u00a0\nUnconcerned with plans for harvest\nthey ignore my pleas to be patient, to reflect\nbefore taking an irrevocable step.\nTrees simply answer the season\u2019s necessity,\nunable to deny the spirit\nmoving through by drawing silly\ndistinctions between the self and soul.\nThis poem begins with the simple image of a plum tree, but as the poem progresses a parallel between what is happening to this tree and what sometimes happens with humans emerges\u2013a sudden burst of inspiration and an urge to follow one\u2019s desires, to be wild in spirit without stopping too long to think about it, to \u201csimply answer to the season\u2019s necessity.\u201d This poem also unveils the yearning and sometimes impatience humans have to control the natural world, which cannot be contained. Even though this poem starts off simply, it makes leaps to ultimately arrive at something much larger.\nPlease join us for a lovely evening with Joanne Harris Allred, Thursday, April 10th at 7:30 pm in Colousa 100B. Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, Writer\u2019s Voice readings are free and open to the public.\nBy Kris Wheat\n\n\nApril 9, 2014watershedcsuc CSUC, Joanne Harris Allred, poetry, Writer's Voice Reading Series\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nWriter\u2019s Voice Spotlight: Daryl\u00a0Farmer \n\n\nCSU, Chico\u2019s Writer\u2019s Voice is proud to present author, Daryl Farmer, Tuesday, February 25, 2014 at 7:30 PM in Colusa 110. Farmer is author of Bicycling beyond the Divide: Two Journeys into the West, which won the Barnes and Noble Discover Great New Writer\u2019s Award and was a Colorado Book Award finalist. Along with his book, Farmer has appeared in Hayden\u2019s Ferry Review, The Laurel Review, Quarter After Eight, and Isotope. Farmer also had a short story published recently, \u201cWhere We Land,\u201d which ran in the Summer 2013 issue of The Whitefish Review. Currently, Farmer is a Professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and teaches Creative Writing and a Film and Literature course that examines the short story in relationship to film adaptation.\nFarmer\u2019s first book, Bicycling beyond the Divide: Two Journey\u2019s into the West, is a beautifully woven piece of literature that seamlessly grounds its reader in time and place, allowing for us to follow him on his journey amongst the diverse population and ever changing physical and social landscapes that make up America, as well as the most difficult leg of the trip through his previous, current and projected self. But as we follow along with Farmer, we realize that part of the load he\u2019s carrying is us, the reader, whom he\u2019s placed on the handlebars of his Trek 520 and given us a firsthand view of the world as he sees it unfolding, opening our eyes to the world around us and forcing us to find ourselves within it:\nI looked up at the mountains now as I rode through the falling snow. The aspen trees that once covered the hillsides were gone. In their place stood condominiums packed together so tight, it was hard to tell if there were many buildings or just one, fortress-like and stretching for what seemed miles.\nWas it the world that had changed, or was it me? Now, during a time of heightened security, it was difficult to imagine that I would get away with camping on a resort town golf course. Terrorism and war. Civilian Minutemen with guns \u201cprotecting\u201d our southern border. It was a time when a government-issued color code was used to gauge our risk, and freedom itself was being reconfigured to fit the changes. A dosage of fear was fed to us daily. Vitamin or sugar pill, who could say? The news seemed gloomy, yet in 1985 the news had been of starving children, environmental degradation, crisis in the Middle East.\nAt twenty I had feared nothing.\nFrom this brief excerpt, we see how Farmer puts the physical surroundings into perspective with brief descriptive detail, yet leaves enough room for us to fill in the scenery with our own experiences of diminished vegetation and urban sprawl within our community. He paints a vivid picture of the social climate that we reside in, while reflecting on what it was like for him and all who were there in \u201985, prodding us to ask the very question he asks of himself: \u00a0\u201cWas it the world that had changed, or was it me?\u201d\nPlease join us for a wonderful evening with visiting author, Daryl Farmer. Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, our readings are free and open to the public.\nhttp://www.darylfarmer.com/\nBy Jeremy Wallace\n\n\nFebruary 24, 2014watershedcsuc CSUC, Daryl Farmer, Writer's Voice Reading Series\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nWriter\u2019s Voice Spotlight: Jon\u00a0Raymond \n\n\nThe Chico State Writer\u2019s Voice is proud to present author Jon Raymond.\u00a0 Raymond is the author of the novel\u2019s Half-Life and Rain Dragon, and a collection of short stories, Livability, winner of the 2009 Ken Kesey award for fiction.\u00a0 He\u2019s also a screenwriter whose credits include Old Joy, Wendy and Lucy, Meek\u2019s Cutoff, Night Moves, and the HBO miniseries Mildred Pierce.\u00a0 He lives in Portland with his family.\u00a0 Raymond\u2019s work was described by Publishers Weekly as, \u201cGorgeous\u2026Raymond reveals how close failure (and worse) lingers,\u201d and Booklist has described his work as \u201cdelicately refined and sublimely electric.\u201d\nYou are strongly encouraged to see Jon Raymond read his work on Thursday, Oct. 17th at 7:30 pm in Ayers 201.\n\n\nOctober 16, 2013watershedcsuc CSUC, Jon Raymond, Writer's Voice Reading Series\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nWriter\u2019s Voice Spotlight: Brenda\u00a0Hillman \n\n\nThe Butte College Literary Events Committee and CSU, Chico\u2019s Writer\u2019s Voice Series are proud to present poet Brenda Hillman. Hillman will be reading from her new collection, \u201cSeasonal Words with Letters on Fire\u201d at the 1078 Gallery, Tuesday, October 8th at 7:30 pm.\nBorn in Tucson, Arizona in 1951, Hillman has earned degrees at Pomona College and the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. She is currently a professor of creative writing at Saint Mary\u2019s College in Moraga, California and is the author of nine books of poetry. She has received a number of awards, including a Pushcart Prize and the Delmore Schwartz Memorial Award, as well as fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Poetry Society of America. Hillman was also a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for her collection Bright Existence (1993) and a finalist for the National Book Critic\u2019s Circle Award for her collection Loose Sugar (1997). Her latest collection, Seasonal Works with Letters on Fire (2013) is a nominee for the National Book Award.\nSays Publishers Weekly: \u201cHillman\u2019s fast-moving, energetic, and ample 10th collection blazes with indignation . . . . It\u2019s one page lyrics its one-page lyrics connect the origins of the Roman alphabet, children\u2019s reading habits, topical cries against our present-day wars, the evils of genetically modified seeds, the structure of Greek tragedy (\u201cTiny first with hurt earth spirits/ as in Aeschylus\u201d), prose essays on poetry and protest, daily life on a West Coast campus, and larger-scale objections to the way that human beings have treated the earth\u2026\u2018Around each word you\u2019re reading/ there spins the unknowable flame.\u2019\u201d\nHillman\u2019s poetry explores the way we use and interact with both the written and spoken word. \u00a0Her poetry works to displace our familiarity with language: the same letters we use to communicate \u201cdrone strike\u201d or \u201cmother\u201d on one page have, on another, been literally turned on end as she does in \u201cAutumn Ritual With Hate Turned Sideways.\u201d In the case of \u201cTwo Summer Aubades, After John Clare,\u201d she reduces lines to linguistic building blocks:\n\u00a0\nI. \u00a0towhee [Pipilo crissalis] wakes a human\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 pp cp cp cp chp chp\npppppppppppp\ncppppcpp \u00a0\u00a0cpp \u00a0\u00a0cpp\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a woman tosses)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gulf disaster \u00a0ster sister\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0aster \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0aster as \u00a0\u00a0asp\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ppp cp cp p \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0bp \u00a0bp BP BP\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0scree \u00a0screeeeem \u00a0we\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 we we didn\u2019t\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0neee neeed to move so fast\n2. woman in red sweater to humminbird\n\u00a0\u00a0 sssssss \u00a0we \u00a0sssssss weee\nno i\u2019m not not \u00a0sweet not\n\u00a0sweeeeetie i\u2019m not\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 something to eeeeeeat\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTwo Summer Aubades, After John Clare\u201d \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgxCNYzuHxI\nThe bold poetics found within the pages of \u201cSeasonal Works With Letters On Fire\u201d are further expressed through Hillman\u2019s approaches to form. Take for instance a haibun entitled \u201cThe Body Politic Loses Her Hair,\u201d which not only does not include a haiku, it does include a 1\u201dx3/4\u201d image of the poet holding a protest sign embedded within the text. Or a seemingly new form: a series of double columned \u201cgalaxies\u201d dedicated to Helen Hillman and Ruth Gander.
