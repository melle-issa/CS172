Walensky, M.D., M.P.H., endorsed the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices\u2019 (ACIP) recommendations for use of updated COVID-19 boosters from Pfizer-BioNTech for people ages 12 years and older and from Moderna for people ages 18 years and older.\nUpdated COVID-19 boosters add Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 spike protein components to the current vaccine composition, helping to restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination by targeting variants that are more transmissible and immune-evading.\nIn the coming weeks, CDC also expects to recommend updated COVID-19 boosters for other pediatric groups, per the discussion and evaluation of the data by ACIP on Sept. 1, 2022. When data are available and FDA authorizes these other types of COVID-19 boosters, CDC will quickly move to help make them available in the United States.\nThe Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) authorization of updated COVID-19 boosters, and CDC\u2019s recommendation for use, are critical next steps forward in our country\u2019s vaccination program\u2014a program that has helped provide increased protection against COVID-19 disease and death.\nThe following is attributable to Dr. Walensky:\n\u201cThe updated COVID-19 boosters are formulated to better protect against the most recently circulating COVID-19 variant. They can help restore protection that has waned since previous vaccination and were designed to provide broader protection against newer variants. This recommendation followed a comprehensive scientific evaluation and robust scientific discussion. If you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it.\u201d\n###\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\nCDC works 24/7 protecting America\u2019s health, safety and security.
