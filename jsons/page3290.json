At the nearby tide pools, the high schoolers \u2014 some visiting the ocean for the first time \u2014 happened upon an octopus, tucked away in a den of rocks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so fun and exciting to get kids out into nature playing with science,\u201d said Marissa Bills, a master's student in the Marine Conservation Lab. She\u2019s among several Cal Poly student guides facilitating the summer camps that brought dozens of Lindsay High\u2019s juniors and seniors, referred to as Lindsay Learners, to the coast.\n\u201cPeople can come to the beach and have absolutely no idea the number of different organisms that they're literally standing on top of. They\u2019ll look at the natural environment differently,\u201d Bills said.\nThis summer\u2019s breathtaking discoveries happened thanks to a new partnership between Lindsay High School, Cal Poly and the Santa Rosa Creek Foundation. It offers historically underrepresented students from the Tulare County community of Lindsay, 60 miles south of Fresno, exposure to marine science and college life.\nThe inaugural program involved a team of 13 Cal Poly student participants, including three ambassadors and program co-planners: (left to right) Shefali (Shea) Venkatramani, Crystal Castillo and Andres Rocha Jayasinha.In addition to the Lindsay Learners summer camps, the Santa Rosa Creek Foundation supports student scholarships, field trips and Learn by Doing Labs.\nDuring their days at Cal Poly, the Lindsay Learners dove into a long list of activities: observing sea creatures in touch tanks, kayaking in Morro Bay, learning about local sea otter and elephant seals, and spending a day at sea on the Patriot Sportfishing boat. After researching the topics and drawing from their own experiences, the high schoolers gave presentations on careers in the fields of oceanography, fisheries, marine ecology, marine conservation, and aquaculture.\n\u201cCampers gained a new appreciation for careers in marine science,\u201d said Nikki Adams, a Cal Poly biological science professor and program manager for Lindsay outreach. \u201cAnd by staying in the dorms along with camp activities and workshops, they got a sense of what college life is like and that dramatically increased their interest in attending college.\u201d\nThe Lindsay Learner field trips and camps required months of planning and coordination through the efforts of Cal Poly's Learn by Doing Lab Instructor Jenny Cruz. Cruz handled logistics and closely collaborated with Adams, Chance Hoellwarth, director of CESAME, and their student ambassador team to help make the program possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\n\n\nStudents observed \u2014 and touched \u2014 some sea animals at Cayucos tide pools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\n\n\nLindsay Learners plot a transect on the beach, noting what creatures appear closest to the shoreline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\n\n\nProfessor Nikki Adams (right) analyzes seaweed with Lindsay Learners at a Cayucos tide pool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\n\n\nLindsay Learners filter sand from the tidal zone to search for shellfish in Cayucos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\n\n\nLindsay High School juniors and seniors took part in the multi-day summer camps, including trips to the beach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\n\n\nCal Poly ambassadors introduce ninth graders from Lindsay High School to sea animals in touch tanks during a tour of the Cal Poly Pier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\n\n\nDuring a tour of the pier, students practiced capturing sea water to observe plankton.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\t\t\t\t\t/\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\n\n\nSome high schoolers visited the ocean for the first time during the summer camps and tours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElizabeth Acevedo, a Cal Poly computer engineering student, served as a resident adviser for the program.\n\u201cMy role was staying in the dorms with the students and helping them feel welcome and safe during their stay,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cI had the opportunity to get to know these students' stories, goals, and struggles.\u201d\nAcevedo, whose parents were born in Guanajuato, Mexico, said she was able to offer her perspective as a child of immigrants and help encourage them to achieve their dreams.\n\u201cI was able to be a role model for my students and show them that although we come from a low-income community, are the first to go to college in our family, and took on the weight of taking care of our parents or siblings \u2014 anything we set our mind to is possible, and we are more than capable of accomplishing our goals,\u201d Acevedo said.\nLindsay students at the summer camps included those interested in marine biology, as well as some leaning toward engineering or chemistry, said Ashley Adams, a camp guide and biological sciences master's student who\u2019s researching the impact of microplastics on oysters.\n\u201cThe whole goal is for them to obviously see our marine science programs but if they are interested in other majors, we can talk about that,\u201d Ashley Adams said.\nThe summer camps took place just weeks after five separate groups of ninth grade Lindsay High School biology students visited Cal Poly. They had the chance to explore Avila Beach, interacted with marine life in touch tanks at the Cal Poly Pier and tour the Cal Poly campus through one-day field trip excursions.\nThe learning experience didn\u2019t only motivate budding high schoolers, it inspired several Mustangs to become more involved in the marine sciences.\n\u201cOne of the Cal Poly student mentors, Gillian Douglas, told me \u2018I never thought about being a teacher and I love outreach,\u2019\u201d Nikki Adams said. \u201cShe said, \u2018I want to help you with every outreach event from here on out.\u2019\u201d\nAbout the lead photo: Ninth graders from Lindsay High School meet a lobster during a tour of the Cal Poly Pier in May.\nWant more Learn by Doing stories in your life?
