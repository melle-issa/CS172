That gives time to also prepare suggestions for on-boarding and off-boarding routines, and document these.\nHaving a known schedule for volunteers would help with repeated tasks performed throughout the day on the international forums. It would also help leverage moderation on rosetta forums that may otherwise not have the same level of active volunteers already.\nAnother important element to keep in mind that we need to ensure that those who are sponsored have the access needed to carry out the tasks that are expected of them.\nSome other elements that were brought up (and will be more thoroughly covered in the followup post) were the forum-password-resets email inbox, which is used to help users who are unable to reset their passwords, but is also where banned users are asked to reach out. This is an area where de-escalation experience is worth a lot, and the added benefit of support network sponsored volunteers often have that an individual might not have, would play in.\nWe recommend reading the discussion in its entirety during the meeting for those who wish to get a full picture of the current suggestions, as a prelude to the dedicated discussion on the topic.\n\n\n\nLeonard Cohen \u2013 Hallelujah (Live at Glastonbury)#weekly-chatLogin to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMarius L.

These are for topics that should not be discussed in public for various reasons, such as privacy concerns for users involved, or just to ensure that the team provides a unified response to an ongoing highly opinionated discussion.\nThe team is slowly rolling this out to include our volunteers on rosetta forums as well, and hope to start sending out invited in the next 1-2 weeks, reaching out first to only invite those who have an interest in it.\nRequest for input: Support Status\nData and statistics can help guide a lot of decisions, and also give insights into how things are going as a whole.\nThere is a call for input on what kind of information people would find interesting at https://make.wordpress.org/support/2023/04/request-for-input-support-stats/\nWhen collecting information though, it is important to see it as a whole, and as chance would have it, a great article was shared at https://www.commsor.com/post/how-to-be-a-good-community-data-analyst about this on the same day as our meeting, giving some good thoughts and insights into just that.\n\n\n\nFonzi M \u2013 Sincerely (From \u201cViolet Evergarden\u201d)#weekly-chatLogin to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMarius L.

(a Slack account is required)\n\nHeadlines / Community updates\nThis is where news that are relevant or good to know for the team from across the community are brought up and shared.\nOpening up for more sponsored volunteers\nSupport is currently one of the teams where it\u2019s been hard to find new regular contributors, and a previously fairly close-knit group.\nWith Five for the Future being a driving factor in bringing in consistent participation from sponsored volunteers, let\u2019s look at what this would be like within the support team.\nAs some of you may have taken note of, we\u2019ve had a really good experience with testing this for a little while now with some sponsored volunteers, and it would be beneficial to extend this.\nWith sponsored volunteers comes some expectations, both from the team, but also from the sponsor side of things, and this is something we need to take into account. This means it is unlikely to be a reasonable use of time to put a sponsored volunteer to answer forum topics all day (although beneficial to have some focused time to address community ran plugins or theme reviews and support requests, such as anything maintained by the WordPress.org user account), but that they are instead someone with a fixed schedule that can be leveraged for tasks that would otherwise be unfair to burden volunteers with, for example.\nThis means that we would expect a commitment from those who sponsor time, but we also need to provide those sponsored individuals with the access needed to perform the tasks.\nHow can we best facilitate for such an intake of potential new fresh eyes and eager participants?What tasks do we envision would be good to have handled on fixed schedules, that are not currently so?What are your thoughts?\nChecking in with international liaisons\nThis is the section where we reach out to the non-English speaking parts of our community, to see how they are doing, if there\u2019s anything we can help each other with, or just interesting things going on that it would be nice to share with others.\nThere\u2019s no requirements for previous participation or \u201cfame\u201d to share here, anyone is welcome, and we encourage newcomers to participate!\n\nUnable to make the meeting, or maybe meetings just aren\u2019t your thing? We would still love to hear how things are going in other non-English speaking parts of our community. Please feel free to let us know via the comment section below, in your own time, if there is anything you\u2019d like to share, any questions or concerns you have, or just to let us know you\u2019re doing OK!\nWe will make a habit of putting this callout with every agenda post going forward, so that everyone has a chance to join in.\n\n\n\nFor any other items to discuss, please add them to the comments below, or bring them up in the meeting.\n\nLogin to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMarius L.

A post for collecting input on what information may be valuable has now been set up and seeking input from community participants.\nWordCampWordCamp WordCamps are casual, locally-organized conferences covering everything related to WordPress.

As usual, there will be a Contributor Day.\nAs is customary on these days, we\u2019re looking for someone who would like to help lead the Support Team table at the event. This generally includes giving a short introduction about the team at the start of the day, helping onboard new contributors through the day, and giving a summary at the end of the day.

The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at https://make.wordpress.org/chat/. channels increased from one to two, when a new private Slack channel called #support-moderators was created on February 23, 2023.\nWhile the Support team will continue to default to public discussion wherever possible, communicating in the existing #forums channel, the private channel will act as a complementary communication avenue.\nThe new channel is intended for sensitive discussions among moderators and administrators of both the international and \u2013 eventually \u2013 the Rosetta support forums. It gives members of the Support team somewhere to more freely discuss issues such as handling spam and sock-puppet accounts, maintaining users privacy in sensitive discussions, along with other challenging forum situations that are better managed outside the public space.\nFolks are still always welcome in the #forums channel to get forum-related help, such as asking a moderator to lock an announcement thread in a pluginPlugin A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party or theme forum, or reporting users who are posting spam in the forums. Weekly Support-team meetings will also continue to be held in #forums, and everyone is welcome to join.\nIf you have any questions about the new private channel, please ask!

(such as topics created, replies created), but these do not give a good insight without associative information such as dates or times.\nDuring a recent team meeting, the prospect of including some statistics with our weekly updates was brought up, which would be the baseline for any  such dashboard.\nBy introducing some numbers in our updates, we can improve transparency around the teams interactions, and also start to make the call on what information would be good to have in an analytics dashboard.\nSome of the ideas that were shared to get the ball rolling were:\nAmount of posts comparison between themes, plugins, and general global forums in the given time frame\nAmount of users blocked in the given time frame\nAmount of reported topics handled in the given time frame\nAmount of resolved thread within the given time frame\nWhat information would be good to have, and in what way should it be presented to give the most value, both to the team, but also to anyone looking in and wanting to learn more?Login to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\u2190 Older posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\nWeekly meeting\n\n\tOur weekly meetings are held every Thursday at 17:00 UTC, with the first meeting of the month being office hours, and the next will be at Thursday, 17:00 UTC\u00a0(your time zone) in #forums on Slack.\n\nEmail Updates\n\n\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail Address\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJoin 1,458 other subscribers\t\t\t\t\n\nRSS - PostsRSS - Comments\n\n\n\n\t\t\tTeam Pledges\n\t\t\n\n1397 people have pledged time to contribute to Support Team efforts!
