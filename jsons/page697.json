Everything I needed was just a short walk away and I had so many opportunities to get more involved on campus. The best part by far was being able to live in suite style housing with some of my closest friends and making memories that will last a lifetime!\n\n\n\n\n\nSophia Siotos | Business Administration Major, Marketing Concentration\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLiving on campus allowed me to meet other students and find my best friends at SSU! Not only was living on campus convenient, but I was able to get involved on campus and enjoy all that Sonoma State has to offer.\n\n\n\n\n\nCasey Fabbri | Communications Major\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLiving on campus allows you to feel apart of campus life while meeting new people who live around you. Campus living is a great option if you are wanting to meet new people or find new interests.\n\n\n\n\n\nCole Bertrand | Business Administration Major\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI chose to live on campus my freshman year to make friends and stay involved in campus life and it was the best decision I could've made! It helped me find my best friend / current roommates & made the transition into college life so much easier. Don't miss your opportunity!\n\n\n\n\n\nSidney Adame | Liberal Studies Major, Chemistry Minor\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe best part about being on campus was the simple five minute walk to everything I needed: the Rec, Kitchens, work, and classes all within a few strides of each other. In addition, the common living room and lawns made feeling involved and knowing my village mates so much easier and better!\n\n\n\n\n\nSean Kenneally | Communications and Environmental Studies Major\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLiving on campus with my friends offered me the ability to fully immerse myself in all things SSU. I was surrounded by roommates who turned into my best friends because of all of the long lasting memories we made while living together. Deciding to live on campus was one of the best decisions I ever made.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatille Goldstein | Business Administration and Psychology Major\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNot only was living on campus beautiful and convenient, but it also gave me the opportunity to meet some of my best friends! Living in the residential communities helped us all build a community and made SSU feel like home. Roomies by chance, besties by choice!\n\n\n\n\n\nCaitlin Aaron-Vadnais | Communications Major, English Minor\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI prefer to live on campus because it makes going to classes, attending events, and work a lot easier. By living on campus I was also able to meet a lot more people that I never would have met. By staying in the residential areas it helps and motivates you to be more involved on campus as well as the community. \n\n\n\n\n\nAlexis Perez | Business Administration Major, Finance Concentration \n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLiving on campus was the best part of Sonoma. It\u2019s like living in nice apartments with only your friends as neighbors. Having your own bathroom and full kitchen makes the experience much better.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrant Malmquist | Business Major, Marketing Concentration \n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLiving on campus has made my college experience unforgettable! I loved the convenience of being a walk away from anything you need, whether it's class, the Kitchens, or the Rec! I especially enjoyed having my own room and bathroom. I can definitely see why SSU Housing is ranked #1!\n\n\n\n\n\nValentina Hidalgo | Business Administration Major, Marketing Concentration\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLiving on campus all four years of my college career has been a great experience. I had the opportunity of living in the First Generation designated housing. As a First Gen student, this was a great way to make connections with people with the same drive and empowerment, as well as, have a support system that helps navigate you through your educational and personal journey.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvelyn Munguia | Women\u2019s and Gender Studies Major\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI enjoyed living on campus as it was convenient to walk to the Rec Center, The Kitchens, work, and enjoying the on-campus activities. I also enjoyed making connections with my roommates and creating memories in my college experience. This also helped me to be more involved on campus and to be more social with others as I feel that the villages helped build community and support. Being able to transition from high school to college with living on campus helped me to grow into being the person that I am today and shape my college experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nDirk Tolson | Statistics Major, Spanish and Computer Science Minor\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLiving on campus at Sonoma State has been nothing short of amazing! Being able to be in walking distance from my classes, having a full kitchen at my fingertips, and having the opportunity to chose how many people I want to share a room with. The community areas such as the pool or outside common areas allow me to meet new people and socialize! I highly recommend living on campus as I believe it enhances your overall experience as a student at SSU.\n\n\n\n\n\nEllie Zielsdorf | Communications Major\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nPrevious Next \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Why YOU Should Live SSU?  \n\n\n\n\nWhy Should YOU Live SSU?\n\n\nVideo of Why Should YOU Live SSU?\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nFind out what it means to live and thrive at Sonoma State University.
