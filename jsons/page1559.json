As engineering systems have become more advanced, emphasis is placed on carrying out simulation-based design at scale of these systems, with increased\u00a0focus on nonlinear, multi-physics, and multi-scale analyses. Realistic applications in computational science and engineering involve multi-fidelity data that need to be assimilated in the simulations for validation and robust predictions. The new paradigm of physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a powerful simulation method that seamlessly integrates simulations and data.\u00a0\nProgram Directors George Karniadakis and Yuri Bazilevs\nWhy Brown?\nBrown University has nationally recognized and highly ranked programs in engineering and applied mathematics. Many of our faculty are working on developing state-of-the-art numerical methods and machine learning approaches, with applications that are of particular relevance to this program. The School of Engineering at Brown University has also played a central role in the development of finite element methods and software. ABAQUS software, arguably the most widely adopted and used commercial finite element software package in the world, was created by two Brown University School of Engineering Ph.D. graduates.\n\u00a0\n\nWho is the Program Designed For?\nStudents with recent bachelor of science degrees in engineering, applied mathematics, computer science, and other related disciplines pursuing careers that involve advanced modeling and simulation in engineering and physical sciences are encouraged to apply. Working professionals whose success on the job depends on their ability to competently perform high-fidelity engineering simulations with data assimilation and machine learning expertise\u00a0are also encouraged to apply.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nProgram Outcomes\nUpon completion of the program coursework, students will:\nGain the understanding of a significant role that advanced data-driven simulation plays in industry and\u00a0national laboratories\nDevelop an appreciation for the power of multi-fidelity, data-driven modeling and simulation in contemporary\u00a0engineering design\nGain technical knowledge of the foundational subjects in computational engineering, including\u00a0nonlinear finite element analysis and the integration of machine learning\u00a0and data science\nDevelop the necessary technical skills in data science and expertise to knowledgeably carry out practical\u00a0engineering-scale, data-driven inference and simulations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Learn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvidence\nRI\n02912\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n401-863-1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Navigation\n\n\n\n\nVisit Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Navigation\n\n\n\n\nReservations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareers at Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe campaign for building on distinction\n\nGive To Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Brown University \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool of Engineering Brown University \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFor You\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Site Navigation\n\n\n\n\nMobile Site Navigation\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmission\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Site Only\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of Brown.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster\u2019s in Data-Enabled Computational Engineering and Science\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen details for Master\u2019s in Data-Enabled Computational Engineering and Science\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookmark this Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
