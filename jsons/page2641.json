COVID-19.\nA study on the efficacy of face masks against COVID-19 published in the November 2020 issue of the journal Medical Hypotheses is not a \u201cStanford study.\u201d The author\u2019s affiliation is inaccurately attributed to Stanford, and we have requested a correction. The author, Baruch Vainshelboim, had no affiliation with the VA Palo Alto Health System or Stanford at the time of publication and has not had any affiliation since 2016, when his one-year term as a visiting scholar on matters unrelated to this paper ended.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy shows why second vaccine dose effective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        stanford medicine magazine\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApart yet together\n\n\n\nThis special report explores the impact of the pandemic and how Stanford health workers, researchers, students and teachers are uniting to fight it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Medicine\nNews\nEvents\nCareers\nContact\n\n\nHealth Care\nStanford Health Care\nStanford Children's Health\n\n\n\n\nResearch\nBasic Science Departments\nClinical Science Departments\nCenters & Programs\nInstitutes\n\n\nEducation\nA-Z Directory\nAcademic Programs\nFaculty Development & Diversity\nSchool Contacts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Find People\n\n\n Visit Stanford\n\n\n Search Clinical Trials\n\n\n Give a Gift\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a92023 Stanford Medicine\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\n\n\nSee us on Facebook\n\n\n\n\nSee us on Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford University\n\n\nStanford School of Medicine\n\n\nStanford Health Care\n\n\nStanford Children's Health\n\n\nStanford Health Care Tri-Valley\n\n\nStanford Medicine Partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
