We are also responsible for processing transfer credit and maintaining articulation agreements with other institutions. Additionally, we register new and continuing students for classes, maintain academic records, prepare transcripts and diplomas, and review petitions for exception to University policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREGISTRATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFORMS & RECORDS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGRADUATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTITAN DEGREE AUDIT (TDA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARTICULATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCALENDAR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice of Availability of the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report\n\n\nJEANNE CLERY REPORT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice of Non-Discrimination on the Basis of Gender or Sex and Contact Information for Title IX Coordinator\n\n\nTITLE IX AND GENDER EQUITY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site is maintained by \n\t\t\t\t\t\tCSUF Registration and Records.\nLast Published 4/13/22\nTo report problems or comments with this site, please contact \n\t\t\t\t\t\tarwebmaster@fullerton.edu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 California State University, Fullerton.
