To ensure our graduates are prepared to meet the challenge, Sonoma State infuses these principles into everything we do \u2013 our academic and student life, physical campus and operations and regional collaboration throughout the North Bay. Explore how we are making an impact in our community and the world.\nSonoma State University is a member\u00a0of the following organizations, helping to guide and support our sustainability and resiliency goals.\nSecond Nature is committed to accelerating climate action in, and through, higher education. From its founding, Second Nature has worked to expand higher education\u2019s ability to solve pressing sustainability challenges. [They] do this by mobilizing a diverse array of higher education institutions to act on bold climate commitments, to scale campus climate initiatives, and to create innovative climate solutions. [They]\u00a0align, amplify, and bridge the sector\u2019s efforts with other global leaders to advance urgent climate priorities.\nThe Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education\u00a0(AASHE) empowers higher education faculty, administrators, staff and students to be effective change agents and drivers of sustainability innovation. We work with and for higher education to ensure that our world\u2019s future leaders are motivated and equipped to solve sustainability challenges.\nSSU also participates in the\u00a0AASHE program\u00a0Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System, known as STARS. This\u00a0is a transparent, self-reporting framework for colleges and universities to measure their sustainability performance. In the Spring of 2021, Sonoma State University achieved enough points to garner a\u00a0Silver\u00a0rating designation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\nOur Commitment\nOur Impact\nOur Students\nNews\nCalendar of Events\nClimate Pledge\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFacebook for Sustainable SSU \n\n\n Twitter for Sustainable SSU\n\n\nInstagram for Sustainable SSU\n\n\nYouTube for Sustainable SSU\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews & Calendar\nNews\nCalendar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Apply to Join the Global Sustainability Across the Curriculum Program Development Support Group!\n\n\nApril 6, 2023\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Climate Change and California\u2019s Action Plan \n\n\nJanuary 20, 2023\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Climate Change and Society LIBS 320B video project\n\n\nDecember 19, 2022\n\n\n  \n\n\nView all News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSU Facebook\nSSU Twitter\nSSU Instagram\nSSU Youtube\nSSU News RSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Ave\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n707.664.2880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact SSU\nPrivacy Notice\nCalifornia State University\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSafeSSU\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\nEmergency Information\nJobs\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
