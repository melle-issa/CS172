Our organizational name has changed from Information Resources to Information Technology, and we're already working on many exciting plans to take technology services to the next level and evolve our\u00a0service portfolio\u00a0to\u00a0strategically leverage\u00a0technology opportunities to\u00a0provide\u00a0new\u00a0value to\u00a0the University. But in the meantime, we're continuing to provide the same comprehensive IT services that you've come to rely on including services to support teaching and learning, research, and university business operations.This website includes information about the\u00a0nine major departments/areas(opens in new window)\u00a0that make up the Division of IT, and information about how to request\u00a0services(opens in new window). In the coming months, we'll be working on updates to our website to provide more information as well as communicating our organizational/service changes to campus.\u00a0Intro to VPIT/CIO Monique SendzeStaff and Student SpotlightFebruary 2022Staff Spotlight: Craig Bentley(opens in new window)Student Spotlight: Iris Lopez LopezHow to Request Services from IT\n                        Contact an IT Department\n                    \n                        View the IT Support Catalog\n                    Quick Start GuidesFind technology tools and resources to support your teaching, academic career, or work life.\n                        IT Quick Start for Faculty\n                    \n                        IT Quick Start for Students\n                    \n                        IT Quick Start for Staff\n                    Information TechnologyKendall Hall, 109www.csuchico.edu/itSupport Our CollegeMore in our divisionComputing & Communication ServicesCreative Media & TechnologyEnterprise ApplicationsInformation SecurityInstitutional Research and Strategic Analytics (IRSA)IT Administrative ServiceIT Support ServicesTechnology Equity and Inclusion\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.Contact UsNeed Help?FacebookFacebookTwitterTwitterInstagramInstagramReport an accessibility issueReport a broken link on this pageTitle IXPrivacy PolicyCalifornia State University, Chico400 West First StreetChico, CA 95929Copyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n",
