By creating a series of learning pathways for WordPress, we can provide learners with a comprehensive understanding of the platform and its open sourceOpen Source Open Source denotes software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.  Open Source **must be** delivered via a licensing model, see GPL. contribution methods. There are many benefits to using learning pathways to create curriculum, including:\nIncreased Engagement: Learning pathways provide a clear roadmap for learners, which can help to keep them engaged and motivated throughout the learning process.\nPersonalization: Learning pathways can be customized to meet the individual needs and interests of learners, which can help to make the learning experience more effective and relevant. (as suggested for future development in Learn WordPress Needs Assessment Results)\nBetter Outcomes: By providing learners with a structured and comprehensive learning experience, we can help them to achieve their learning goals more efficiently and effectively.\nBetter Collaboration: Learning pathways can encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing among learners, promoting teamwork and problem-solving skills.\nImproved Retention: Learning pathways can help learners retain information better by breaking down complex topics into smaller, manageable sections, making it easier for them to remember what they\u2019ve learned.\nUnifying Strategy: \u00a0By unifying a learner-based strategy around curated content will make Learn.WordPress.org more sustainable and reduce maintenance overload. It will also help enhance and provide additional needed resources for WordPress users, rather than duplicating the efforts of others, including the Documentation team and the Dev CoreCore Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress. Blog.\nTo implement this proposal, we suggest that the WordPress community work together to develop a series of learning pathways for WordPress. These learning pathways could cover topics such as WordPress basics, theme and pluginPlugin A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party development, and ways to contribute to the WordPress open source project. We will\u00a0\nEstablish our baseline audiences\u00a0\nCharter and create their Beginner \u27a1\ufe0f Expert learning journeys.\u00a0\nExample: As a Beginner-level WordPress Frontend Developer, what is the content you need to master to move on to Intermediate competency? What is the content you need to master to move on to Expert competency and so on? If we can break down each audience and outline the core competencies for each level we focus our content creation around that and build out their pathways.\nThe WordPress Training Team will seek opportunities to\u00a0collaborate with hiring managers in the WordPress ecosystem, independent freelancers and contractors, as well as educational institutions and other organizations to develop and promote these learning pathways. Next steps might include partnering with educational institutions to that offer WordPress courses or collaborating with industry organizations to create certification programs.\u00a0\nBy embracing learning pathways, we can help to create a more structured and effective learning experience for individuals who want to learn about WordPress. We believe that this will benefit both learners and the WordPress community as a whole.\nOur first learning pathway for consideration is Introduction to WordPress Development: A proposed learning path.\u00a0\nThis post will remain open until May 1.\nInitial reviews by @bsanevans @west7 @webcommsatShare this:TwitterFacebookLogin to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Evans\n\n6:00 am on April 6, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nI love this idea! Now that Learn.WordPress.org has launched and we\u2019ve got a good catalog of resources published, presenting these to match a user\u2019s learning journey seems like a logical next-step.\nThere are many benefits to using learning pathways to create curriculum\nHistorically, there has been a focus in the Training Team to create content related to WordPress releases. I believe this is one reason that the team\u2019s efforts have felt like they\u2019ve doubled up with efforts by, say, the Documentation team. I agree that pivoting the Training Team\u2019s content creation strategy so that it is based on learning pathways, rather than WordPress releases, will better suit the needs of our users, and cause less overlap with the efforts underway by other teams \ud83e\udd29\n(Just to note, that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t create new content related to new features. But I think switching our priority from \u201ctracking content creation by WordPress release\u201d to \u201ctracking by learning pathway\u201d makes more sense for an educational platform.)\nPersonalization: Learning pathways can be customized to meet the individual needs and interests of learners\nCould you elaborate on what this personalization process would look like? I doubt you mean the Training Team would create a personalized learning pathway for each leaner. Would this be the ability for each learner to structure their own learning pathway?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney Robertson\n\n1:59 pm on April 8, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nRecent updates vs holistic learning:\nThis would not be an either/or approach to content creation on the site. It definitely matters that our team supports what is new, as our content supports direct learners and trainers. Docs likewise has to create new content and revise existing incomplete documentation from other areas.  \nDocs and Training always prioritize user-facing new features and revisionsRevisions The WordPress revisions system stores a record of each saved draft or published update. The revision system allows you to see what changes were made in each revision by dragging a slider (or using the Next/Previous buttons). The display indicates what has changed in each revision. on user-facing existing materials. What often is last priority are developer-focused documentation areas. Our hope is to wildly grow the contributions to keep everything flowing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Evans\n\n7:22 am on April 15, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nIn an ideal world, I agree that these wouldn\u2019t be either/or approaches. I\u2019m also aware that the team\u2019s content ideas backlog continues to grow, and we\u2019re already not keeping up with creating content for the ideas submitted around each WordPress release.\nI think the knack is going to be finding the right balance when prioritizing content creation. We\u2019re not going to be able to create everything. And so \u201clearning paths\u201d would be a new and important index, alongside \u201cnew features\u201d, when considering what to create next.\nTraining always prioritize user-facing new features and revisionsRevisions The WordPress revisions system stores a record of each saved draft or published update. The revision system allows you to see what changes were made in each revision by dragging a slider (or using the Next/Previous buttons). The display indicates what has changed in each revision. on user-facing existing materials.\nI think results from the needs analysis will help us constructively question this. I believe the team should prioritize content that will have the highest impact on the WordPress community. Not every new feature is going to have the same (high) impact. As you say, there is much fundamental developer-related content we could still make on Learn that would probably have higher impact than some of the new features which were released recently.\nAnd that\u2019s where I think your proposal of learning paths can most shine. They will provide the team with a holistic view as to what high-impact content we\u2019re still missing on the site, and guide the team when we\u2019re prioritizing the next content to create.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney Robertson\n\n1:56 pm on April 8, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nCould you elaborate on what this personalization process would look like?\nIn the responses we received from a UX Audit, suggestions were made to create personalized suggestions. That is fairly intensive development, and would not be in scope in the near future. \nIn the pathways @psykro recently proposed, the a user may have already completed the theme dev portion and learned the WP template hierarchy. The next suggestion on home page load or at the end of a course might include pluginPlugin A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party dev next. That would be an example of personalization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenjamin Evans\n\n7:26 am on April 15, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nThanks. That gives me a good idea of what we\u2019re proposing here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJamie\n\n4:23 am on April 12, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nI think this proposal will make it much easier and clearer pathways for both learners and content creators. \nAnother area I think would be great is for small cohorts to learn together with the help of a mentor/tutor who could help them on their pathway. \nCreating pathways is also a great way to show people what you have achieved through tutorials and courses. \nThis proposal would also require content creators to change how and what they create based on these new pathways. I think it would also be a great way to increase collaboration between content creators and students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWes Theron\n\n11:39 pm on April 18, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nThank you, Courtney! Learning pathways is a great idea and has also been on my mind. I would like to get involved with building out the pathways for users when we move forward to the next phase of the proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSsebuwufu Moses\n\n4:03 am on May 1, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nEach pathway could include a combination of video tutorials, interactive exercises, quizzes, and other resources that are tailored to the needs and interests of the learners.\nEnsuring that they are accessible and inclusive for all learners. This could involve providing multiple formats for the content, such as video, audio, and text, and ensuring that the content is presented in a clear and understandable manner.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment. \nThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
