On top of that, discourse around web3 is extremely polarising: everyone involved is very keen to a) pick a team, and b) get you to\u2026 Continue reading WordPress and web3\n\n\nPublished December 10, 2021Categorized as WordPress Tagged web3, WordPress \n\n\n\nWordPress Importers: Free (as in Speech)\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBack at the start of this series, I listed four problems within the scope of the WordPress Importers that we needed to address.

I\u2019m not talking about tidying them up, or improve performance, or fixing some bugs, though these are certainly things that should happen. Instead, we need to consider their purpose, how they fit as a driver of WordPress\u2019 commitment to Open Source, and how they can be a\u2026 Continue reading WordPress Importers: Stating the Problem\n\n\nPublished January 18, 2021Categorized as WordPress Tagged Importers, WordPress \n\n\nPosts navigation\nPage 1\n\u2026\nPage 21\nOlder posts \n \n\n\n\n  Gary Pendergast, noun: MySQL, WordPress, web and music geek.
