The stronger and more bitter the taste the better.\nNow he admits that he didn\u2019t know beans about how rewarding the coffee experience can be.\nDeGuzman and others in the Chapman MS Food Science program have been going through a coffee boot camp of sorts during their graduate studies at the university. Working with cutting-edge equipment as well as faculty and industry mentors, a growing student community is learning about both the science and art of coffee, thanks to class study, lab work and now the camaraderie of the Chapman Coffee Club.\nFrom the sustainable sourcing of beans to the intricacies of the roasting process, from navigating the nuances of flavor profiles to developing and marketing specialty products, the lessons and possibilities continue to pour forth.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting people together to spark new ideas, and that\u2019s what innovation is all about,\u201d said Anuradha Prakash, Ph.D., Food Science professor and Coffee Club mentor. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing all that can happen when people get together over coffee.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting people together to spark new ideas, and that\u2019s what innovation is all about.\u201d\n-Anuradha Prakash, Ph.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-end Aspirations\n\n\n\n\nWhat better product than coffee to get students excited about the science of food processing? So Professor Anuradha Prakash and the Chapman Food Science Program invested in cutting-edge equipment, including software that allows Coffee Club members to monitor the roasting of beans at the nth degree of temperature and pressure. \n\n\n\n\n\nShelf Life\n\n\n\n\nThe support of industry vendors allows the Chapman Coffee Club and co-founder Eric DeGuzman (MS \u201923) to source raw beans from a variety of regions in the coffeegrowing world. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Raw to Roasted\n\n\n\n\nCarefully calibrated roasting can unlock a panoply of flavors rich enough to satisfy the most sophisticated of palates. But it all starts with raw beans that connect the final tasting experience back to the soils and climate of their origin.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Raw to Roasted\n\n\n\n\nCarefully calibrated roasting can unlock a panoply of flavors rich enough to satisfy the most sophisticated of palates. But it all starts with raw beans that connect the final tasting experience back to the soils and climate of their origin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMMMMMM MMMMMM\nAs freshly roasted beans swirl in the cooling bin, the enticing aroma of flavorful moments to come wafts across the patio tables outside the Keck Center for Science and Engineering.\n\n\n\n\n\nChappy Hour\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday afternoons, Coffee Club members share their specialty roasts as well as insights about their process with Chapman students, faculty and staff. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice way not only for us to apply what we\u2019re learning in the lab, but to get feedback so we can refine our roasting and brewing methods to be more applicable to what they want,\u201d says Coffee Club co-founder McKenna Rivers (MS \u201923), right, who plans a career in food industry product development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrounds for Celebration\n\n\n\n\nCoffee Club students and their mentors lift a crystal mug to commemorate the thriving community they\u2019re creating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Art and Science of Coffee\nThe Chapman Coffee Club experience mixes chemistry with creativity to create a vibrant learning community.
