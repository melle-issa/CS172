After years of saving, I\u2019d brought my daughter to the bungalow by the sea where we\u2019d always wanted to spend a summer. She\u2019d graduated from high school two weeks before, so I\u2019d just made it\u2014our last true time together before she went to college. I laced up my running shoes, left her sleeping in the pleasing cottage, and set off for a quick run. I crunched down the shell driveway, salmon-colored in the dawn, onto the oleander-lined path toward town. The humid air pressed my skin but a breeze blew in from the ocean. I was contented, even triumphant. The arched sky was so blue it was hard not to believe in something grand behind it, behind everything.\nI passed through the small town center, where laundry fluttered from the balconies like pastel ghosts. I was someone who had to work harder than others at love, I knew that, even with my daughter, who had always seemed, from the start, too clever to choose comfort. When she was an infant, the knowledge that I alone was the only solution to her troubles was excruciating. But somehow, we\u2019d made it through, and she was on the verge of making her own way in the world. I imagined talking deeply in the days to come, learning what made her feel empty, what made her full.\nI turned the bend in the road for home, the sun lighting the red tin roof and sparkling the distant caplets of the sea. As I neared the house, I saw a black car I didn\u2019t recognize in the driveway and began to feel afraid. I didn\u2019t know why.\nOn the porch a large man with a tanned face, eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses, stood beside my daughter with her pale face, so close to her that he must have smelled her golden hair, the lingering sweet verbena scent of her shampoo. Near my daughter\u2019s feet sat her new suitcase. Her eyes watched me carefully.\nThe man took her elbow in his enormous furred hand, and she told me that they had been secretly married the previous weekend, that they were moving to Chile where he raised horses. While there was no knowing what was true, I knew there was no stopping my girl from doing whatever hard thing she was determined to do.\nCertain men are glad to find certain girls. The more unbreakable the girl, the better. This girl, no, had never wanted contentment. I placed my hand on her cool cheek, so soft. She closed her eyes against the feeling.\n~~~\nPeg Alford Pursell is the author of\u00a0A GIRL GOES INTO THE FOREST, (Dzanc Books, July 2019), and the\u00a0SHOW HER A FLOWER, A BIRD, A SHADOW,\u00a0the 2017 Indies Book of the Year for Literary Fiction.
