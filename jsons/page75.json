After all, for more than 35 years she has worked with people to rebuild their cognitive abilities after those injuries.\nNow she sees some of the same symptoms after mild brain injuries manifest in patients suffering the lingering effects of COVID-19.\n\u201cThey\u2019re having trouble with staying organized, remembering details and meetings, thinking of words that they want to use, being forgetful at home,\u201d says Kennedy, Ph.D., professor of communication sciences and disorders at Chapman University.\nLeveraging their clinical experience, Kennedy and speech-language pathologist Chantale Hucks are working with sufferers of long COVID to reclaim their lives.\n\u201cThere are people who are living with some of these symptoms and trying to get back to work, back to school, back into their household duties \u2013 and some are really struggling,\u201d says Kennedy, who teaches in the Communication Sciences and Disorders Department at Crean College of Health and Behavioral Sciences.\nThe Neuro-Deficit Clinic for COVID-19 Survivors, which was sparked by Kennedy and a donation from the U.S. Justice Charitable Foundation, is based at Chapman\u2019s Rinker Health Science Campus in Irvine. The clinic serves people in person and through telehealth. Anyone can seek evaluation and treatment for free.\nIn fall, speech language pathology graduate students will get to work under supervision with people coming to the clinic.\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of university clinics that are currently seeing COVID clients with students. \u2026 It\u2019s exciting that we can start training our students in this,\u201d Kennedy says.\nShe and Hucks are working in an area still being explored in health care. According to researchers in the November 2021 edition of the journal Pathogens, post-COVID syndrome \u2013 now termed \u201cpost-acute sequelae of COVID-19\u201d by the CDC and NIH \u2013 \u201cdoes not have clear criteria for its prevention, diagnosis, and management tactics. \u2026 Various authors classify complications depending on the genesis, time of its onset, and the form of acute infection.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen very few studies describing the communication problems someone can have after COVID,\u201d Kennedy says.\nIf people who\u2019ve had COVID are having attention or memory challenges, they\u2019ll have a hard time communicating. They may forget the details of a conversation with a spouse in the morning, and in the afternoon tell their kids something that\u2019s not accurate because their thinking is jumbled, she says.\n\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re trying to identify those communication problems and any factors that may be related,\u201d she says.\nKennedy and her colleagues are working on evaluation and study protocols for pinpointing impairment and for finding differences, if any, between people who have long COVID symptoms and those who have fully recovered.\nAt Chapman\u2019s clinic, a patient fills out questionnaires and a speech therapist interviews and evaluates them, then coaches them with strategies to help with things like focusing, remembering and finding the word they\u2019re looking for. They address immediate needs and then the person\u2019s long-term goals. The clinic is soon adding a part-time speech therapist.\n\u201cThey then go about their week trying to use the strategy and then they come back and tell us the extent to which the strategy was useful. Did it work? Was it too much effort? Did they see that this could become a habit?\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cIf the answer is, it was too much work, then we explore other strategies.\u201d\nApps and services like Siri and Alexa have proven very helpful for patients trying to get back to normal, she says.\n\u201cOne of the really positive things we\u2019re noticing is that when people come to us for an evaluation and for assistance, most of them have already put some strategies in place, and we explore the extent to which those strategies are useful and help identify others,\u201d Kennedy says.\nThe adults who have come to the clinic range in age, and the vast majority are working. The clinic is targeting people who are not connected to another long COVID clinic, since these people are likely not getting help, Kennedy says.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping there\u2019s a lot more understanding and that society is less judgmental toward anyone with brain-related problems, such as those after COVID-19,\u201d she says. \u201cI think it\u2019s reached so many people, so hopefully we\u2019ll see an uptick in this kind of empathy.\u201d\nKennedy thinks the clinic will also play a role in offering resources and education to people with long COVID.\n\u201cThere really does seem to be a need for that,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of primary care physicians still don\u2019t know where to refer these folks or what kind of assistance is available for them.\u201d\n\n\narchaeological research Chapman Magazine Communication Sciences and Speech Disorders covid 19 covid19 Crean College Crean College of Health and Behavior Sciences features Harry and Diane Rinker Health Science Campus magazine post-COVID speech communications and disorders speech language pathologists speech therapy \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJoy Juedes \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Maintains Lofty No. 4 Spot in Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Rankings of Top Film Schools\n\n\n\n\n\nSURF Helps Alumna Build on New Love of Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Family Donors Make a Collective Impact On Giving Day\u00a0 Thanks to the enthusiasm of the Chapman Family, Chapman University\u2019s fifth annual Giving Day was an unrivaled success.
