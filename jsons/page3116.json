Please activate your student portal as soon as possible and view your Task list before submitting transcripts.\n\nOnly OFFICIAL High School transcripts will be accepted. \nWhat are official transcripts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof\u00b7fi\u00b7cial\n\n\n\n/\u0259\u02c8fiSH\u0259l/\n\nAdjective\n\nOfficial documents are delivered securely from the originating institution directly to CSUF in an electronic format, or as a hard copy mailed in the institution's sealed envelope, not opened by the student, or anyone other than a CSUF Admission staff member.\u00a0\nPlease Note: Final transcripts should have all grades and graduation date. First-Year Applicants with college coursework can visit College Transcripts for information on how to send official college transcripts.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDeadlines\nCSUF is a highly impacted campus. We receive far more eligible students than we can possibly accommodate. For this reason, deadlines, such as transcript deadlines are strictly enforced. It is solely the student\u2019s responsibility to assure that all required documents are received by the Office of Admissions on or before the deadline in order to finalize your conditional admission. Physical documents must be delivered on or before that date. Electronic transcripts must be transmitted on or before that date.\u00a0\nAll transcripts requests, even electronic ones, require processing times. Please contact each school you have attended and verify how far in advance a transcript request must be made. Transcripts that are requested before a deadline but delivered after will be considered late.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nElectronic Transcripts\nElectronic transcripts are preferred and can significantly expedite the processing time. CSUF accepts official electronic high school transcripts ordered from\u00a0\nParchment Exchange\n and Naviance.\u00a0 Electronic transcripts are preferred, however, if your school\u00a0does not use this service,\u00a0please request paper transcripts.\nWhen\u00a0ordering a transcript select,\u00a0\u00a0\"California State University, Fullerton\"\u00a0\u00a0from the drop-down list. Please avoid selecting \"OTHER\"\u00a0or manually entering email addresses.\u00a0However, if your institution does not already have CSUF\u2019s contact information on file, please use admissions@fullerton.edu to complete your order.\n\n\n\nTuffy\u00a0 TIP:\nIf you are submitting official documents electronically, they must be requested with enough time to ensure they are received on or before the deadline. Electronic requests are not immediate, they require processing time from the institution you attended, so check with your institution and plan accordingly.\nTranscripts that are requested before a deadline but delivered after will be considered late.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPaper Transcripts\nIf at all possible, electronic transcripts are preferred and can significantly expedite the processing time. However, if your intuition does not offer electronic delivery, physical transcripts may be sent. Official transcripts must be delivered sealed in the original envelope to be considered Official.\nOfficial physical transcripts can be mailed to:\n\nCalifornia State University, FullertonOffice of AdmissionsP.O. Box 6900Fullerton, CA 92834-6900\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuffy Tip:\nIf possible, please legibly write your name and CSUF student ID (CWID) on the outside of the sealed envelope.\u00a0 Physical transcript requests are not immediate. They require processing time from the institution you attended, so check with your institution and plan accordingly. Transcripts that are requested before a deadline but delivered after will be considered late.\n\n\n\n\nExam Credit\nIf you have taken an external examination to satisfy a subject requirement (or for admission requirements), please review the following\u00a0document\u00a0\u00a0\nfor minimum passing score, course equivalencies and units earned.\nOfficial Exam Scores must be issued by the appropriate issuing body (ex: College Board, TOEFL, IELTS, etc). Test scores that appear on transcripts will not be accepted for credit.\nSend your official exam credit to Cal State Fullerton using the school code\u00a04589.\n\n\nAdvanced Placement (AP)\u00a0\nrequest score\n\n\n\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB)\u00a0\nrequest transcript or certificate\n\n\n\nCollege Level Examination Program (CLEP)\u00a0\nrequest score\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuffy Tip:\nIf four or more years have lapsed since your AP examination, your scores will be archived. Please allow additional processing time when ordering.\nExam Credit needed to meet admission criteria is held to the same deadlines as transcripts. Scores that are requested before a deadline but delivered after will be considered late.\n\u00a0\n\nSAT/ACT TEST\nSAT (systemwide code 3594/CSUF 4589) or ACT (school code 0355) scores will not be used for admission consideration.\nTest scores are no longer used to determine First-Year Admissions decisions. For more information review the First-Year Student eligibility requirements\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site is maintained by \n\t\t\t\t\t\tOffice of Admissions.\nLast Published 2/22/23\nTo report problems or comments with this site, please contact \n\t\t\t\t\t\tarwebmaster@fullerton.edu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 California State University, Fullerton.
