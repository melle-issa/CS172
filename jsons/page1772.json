Wouldn\u2019t it be even better if it could be spun up instantly. And wouldn\u2019t it be just awesome if this was available for free?\nWordPress Playground is an exciting breakthrough that does all this and more. It runs WordPress in the browser without the need for PHP, Apache, or MySQL.\nWordPress Playground is useful for:\n\nRunnable code snippets in your documentation or course, or even blog posts\nPlugin and theme demos in a private WordPress instance where the user is already logged in as admin\nEasily switching PHP and WordPress version when testing\nReplaying and fixing the failed CI tests right in the browser\n\u2026 and so much more!\n\nYou can check out a live demo of WordPress Playground here: https://developer.wordpress.org/playground/demo/\nIn this presentation Adam Zielinski, a member of the development team that created WordPress Playground, will introduce this exciting new implementation and demonstrate it. He will also explain the technologies that make the magic happen, and run through a variety of scenarios and use cases.\nFollowing the presentation there will be a Q&A giving you the opportunity to ask any questions you may have about WordPress Playground which Adam will be happy to answer.\nPlease note: this session will be recorded and the video published to WordPress.tv and YouTube.
