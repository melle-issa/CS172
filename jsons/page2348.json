The process involves developing formal written agreements between institutions to accept specific courses (or sequences of courses) from a sending campus that are comparable to, or in lieu of, a specific course (or courses) at the receiving campus.\nFormal articulation agreements between SSU and a California Community College are located on ASSIST. \u00a0Assist is the official public database of articulation information for California\u2019s public colleges and universities. \u00a0The agreements listed in ASSIST meet major and minor requirements only. This information should not be used to meet GE requirements.\nArticulation with Private and Out-of-State Insititutions\u00a0\nEven though Articulation agreement priority is given to California community colleges and universities, some agreements have been established for private and out-of-state institutions that are not listed in ASSIST. \u00a0The\u00a0Transfer Evaluation System\u00a0(TES) database houses these agreements.\u00a0\nCSU Fully Online Courses\u00a0\nThe CSU Fully Online Courses website enables CSU students to take one, free, online course every term (semester or quarter) through many of the CSU\u2019s 23 campuses. A \u201cfully online\u201d course is any course that\u2019s offered completely online, meaning there\u2019s no in-person instruction with a professor.\nTest Credit\nExternal Exams\u00a0(AP, CLEP, IB)\nStudents who are eligible to receive academic credit based on the results of Advanced Placement\u00a0(AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), or College Level Examination Program (CLEP) have their official test scores sent directly to SSU in order to receive transfer credit. Test credit granted by another institution does not automatically transfer to SSU.\nAdvanced Placement (AP)\nSelect year exam was completed:\nSSU AP Exam Equivalencies 2022-2023SSU AP Exam Equivalencies 2021-2022\nSSU AP Exam Equivalences 2020-2021SSU AP Exam Equivalencies 2019-20SSU AP Exam Equivalencies 2018-19\nCollege Level Examination Program (CLEP)\nSelect year exam was completed:\nSSU CLEP Equivalencies 2022-2023SSU CLEP Equivalencies 2021-2022\nSSU CLEP Equivalencies 2020-2021SSU CLEP Equivalencies 2019-20SSU CLEP Equivalencies 2018-19\nInternational Baccalaureate (IB)\nSelect year exam was completed:\nSSU IB Exam Equivalencies 2022-2023SSU IB Exam Equivalencies 2021-2022\nSSU IB Exam Equivalencies 2020-2021SSU IB Exam Equivalencies 2019-20SSU IB Exam Equivalencies 2018-19\nDSST Exams\nSSU DSST Exam Equivalencies 2019-20\nInformation about DSST exams can be found at the Get College Credit website.\nTransfer Credit\nSonoma State University will accept courses from accredited colleges and universities that are designated as baccalaureate level at the institution where the work was completed. Some courses may be used to meet specific requirements in General Education(GE) or the major. Transferable courses that do not meet any specific requirement will be accepted as elective credits. Once you are a Sonoma State student you can request your course work to be evaluated for General Education or work towards the major. To request a course be evaluated for GE complete the Petition for GE Course Substitution. For a course substitution for the major meet with your major advisor and complete the Academics Requirements Report Update Form. \u00a0Both forms should be submitted to the Office of the Registrar when completed.\nAssociate's Degree for Transfer (SB1440)\nThe California State University and the California community college systems have collaborated under the Student Transfer Achievement Reform Act (Senate Bill 1440) to create the Associate of Arts for Transfer (AA-T) and the Associate of Science for Transfer (AS-T) degree programs. The collaboration allows students who complete an Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT) to satisfy lower division general education and major requirements determined by the community college in order to create a clear pathway to transfer into a CSU. Upon completion of the ADT, students are eligible to transfer into the CSU system with junior standing and within the same major as their ADT degree. If you are interested in pursuing an AS-T or AA-T degree, please meet with your current academic adviser or visit the\u00a0Associate Degree for Transfer\u00a0website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistrar Home\nHow to Register\nDates & Deadlines\nEnrollment Policies\nForms & Petitions\nFamily Education Rights & Privacy Act (FERPA)\nGraduation\nTransfer Course Information\nHelp & How Tos\nTranscripts\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed Help? \nUse our Contact Form\nOffice of the Registrar\nSalazar Hall, Room 1071(707) 664-2778registrar@sonoma.edu\nHours\nMonday-Friday 8am-5pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSU Facebook\nSSU Twitter\nSSU Instagram\nSSU Youtube\nSSU News RSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Ave\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n707.664.2880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact SSU\nPrivacy Notice\nCalifornia State University\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSafeSSU\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\nEmergency Information\nJobs\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
