It can, with intention, be different every time, and unique to every performer.\nJazz is not alone as an art form that allows this, it exists in a 3D space alongside many other genres and non-sound forms of expression.\nBut keep in mind that formula, combining a deep understanding and respect for the past, with a opportunity for each individual to express their creativity in their own way and evolve a new future, and you\u2019ll see why we\u2019re drawn to jazz as an art form that shares a lot of philosophical underpinnings with how we want to build WordPress.Share this:TwitterFacebookRedditEmailLogin to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nJoen A.\n\n6:54 am on March 27, 2023 \n\n\n\nTags: design ( 158 ), design-share ( 18 ), website-redesign \u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\n\nDesign Share: Mar 13\u2013Mar 24\n\n\nHi, all! Here are a few projects the Design Team has contributed to over the past couple of weeks.\n\nMercantile Social Kit\nA few are working with marketing on a social kit for Mercantile Swag Store. In that process, we defined some color styles that could be further expanded and considered for Mercantile website updates, or any updates related to Mercantile in the future.\n\nSpacing controls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPadding and margin controls use the new stepped slider to provide easily clickable preset sizes that are unified across your theme. The unlinked variations, however, take up a lot of space. In 49264, Jay and others are exploring a more condensed interface.\n\nScaling the blockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. options menu\nInitial ideation around how the block options menu can be scaled, and avoid the burial of common actions. Github issue.\n\nIdeating on the template management view\nFlowing in and out of the template management view in the site editor currently feels a bit awkward. This mockup explores a view-toggle pattern for moving between the \u2018browsing\u2019 and \u2018managing\u2019 contexts.\n\nA note from @sereedmedia:\u00a0\n\nThere is a new Make WordPress SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform https://slack.com/.

Here are a few projects the Design Team has contributed to over the past couple of weeks.\n\nRevisiting the Image Size dropdown\n\n\nWhen you upload an image, the large size will be shown by default. In this case, size refers to the image resolution, specifically the lower-resolution variant that WordPress creates on upload called \u201cLarge\u201d. On modern screens, this resolution is often too low. Issue 48618 explores how we can improve that situation, and in this mockup we explore an interim step to make clearer that the dropdown is about image density, not dimensions, by renaming \u201cImage size\u201d to \u201cResolution\u201d, and showing it inside.\n\nSite Editor metrics\n@jameskoster is working on a PR to adjust some of the spacing and alignment metrics in the Site Editor.\n\nMinimise the footprint of spacing controls\nSpacing controls like Padding and Margin occupy a large space in the blockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. Inspector, particularly when \u2018exploded\u2019 for per-side control. It\u2019s most troublesome when you only want to add a value to a single side.\n\nExploring metrics and color in the Site Editor\u2019s dark sidebarSidebar A sidebar in WordPress is referred to a widget-ready area used by WordPress themes to display information that is not a part of the main content. It is not always a vertical column on the side. It can be a horizontal rectangle below or above the content area, footer, header, or any where in the theme.\nAs the single-entity panels (e.g. when browsing a page) evolve and we present options to perform high-level tasks in the dark sidebar, the UIUI UI is an acronym for User Interface - the layout of the page the user interacts with. Think \u2018how are they doing that\u2019 and less about what they are doing. can become a little more complex. We need to keep refining the system so that it can scale elegantly and intuitively.\n\nLayout\nHow might we increase what layouts are possible with WordPress whilst keeping it feeling intuitive to use for both technical and non technical users? The group/row/stack block and the column block gives us a really strong starting point to build off. Is there an opportunity to simplify? GitHub issue, test website.\n\nIf you have updates you\u2019d like to include in the next Design Share, please drop a note in the Design channel on the Making WordPress SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform https://slack.com/.

Here are a few projects the Design Team has contributed to over the past couple of weeks.\n\nPattern Directory Redesign\nExploring a refresh of the pattern direction in the vein of the Theme Directory.\n\nSite editor visual explorations\nA few visual explorations on how we can improve the edit and save flow in the site editor. Notably, by adding an extra drilldown item for each navigation item or template, we are able to show a clear and ergonomic edit button in context of a useful title. You can still click the preview on the right to hop directly into editing what you see at any point in time, but making this secondary to the navigation on the left is meant to afford some clarity on the structure. A couple of PRs to follow, that explore these efforts: 47142, and 47777.\n\nWordPress.orgWordPress.org The community site where WordPress code is created and shared by the users. This is where you can download the source code for WordPress core, plugins and themes as well as the central location for community conversations and organization.  https://wordpress.org/ 2FA mockups\nAs metaMeta Meta is a term that refers to the inside workings of a group. For us, this is the team that works on internal WordPress sites like WordCamp Central and Make WordPress. teams are currently implementing 2 factor authentication for WP.org accounts, we are exploring a few small visual improvements to parts of the flow. Issue.\n\nCoreCore Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress. interface improvement\nThe Openverse team decided to tackle a core interface improvement of root components. For this project, we are exploring a new version of buttons based on the Tailwind approach. The change is one of the 2023 goals and implies updating the Figma Design Library.\n\nSensitive content view\nAfter the Openverse integration in GutenbergGutenberg The Gutenberg project is the new Editor Interface for WordPress. The editor improves the process and experience of creating new content, making writing rich content much simpler. It uses \u2018blocks\u2019 to add richness rather than shortcodes, custom HTML etc. https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/, Openverse team started discussing the safety browsing experience outside Openverse site. In that vein, we started to explore ideas for landing in sensitive content results.\n\nComponentisation of the \u2018Browse view\u2019 assets\nNow that we\u2019re approaching a good place with the general \u2018Browse view\u2019 UXUX UX is an acronym for User Experience - the way the user uses the UI. Think \u2018what they are doing\u2019 and less about how they do it. it\u2019s time to componentise the different elements which will allow us to rapidly polish all the pixels in time for 6.2.\n\nIf you have updates you\u2019d like to include in the next Design Share, please drop a note in the Design channel on the Making WordPress\u00a0SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform https://slack.com/.
