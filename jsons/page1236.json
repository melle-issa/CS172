Her work has been featured in notable publications such as Ploughshares, American Poetry Review, Rattle, Prairie Schooner, Touchstones and others. Her poems speak about life experiences, inviting the reader to feel and connect with our human struggle and hard-won peace.\nThe greatest gift an artist can do for another artist is to inspire. In reading the breadth of Carole Simmons Oles\u2019 poetry, I was left not only with the courage to go forth and tell my own story, but also carries with me the feeling, the heart, and the emotion of the speaker in her collections. Oles brings the reader into her own heart, and creates an empathic bond with them. She speaks of her own unique experience, her own family, and yet the reader connects with that motherly instinct, that love and fear. A connection they can feel to their core.\nOne of the most striking poems I encountered was \u201cRape Counseling, the 60\u2019s,\u201d found in her book, Sympathetic Systems (Lynx House Press, 2000). The title alone evokes a tightness in the chest when considering what will unfold. Oles is never predictable, or reliant on familiar tropes. Instead, she makes a bold statement about the act, the time, the treatment of victims, and challenges the idea of what a rapist is. The poem is intelligent and true to life, a feminist statement that reclaims power over a situation that does not end with the crime itself. Oles brings intention to the most incremental shifts in language when the speaker says, \u201cAt the Health Center, the woman psychiatrist / let me talk about / what I had / let happen.\u201d And hints that still, today, the speaker suffers with the insinuations that perhaps she was to blame saying, \u201cthen she bore her gray eyes behind glasses into me / \u201cWell\u2026you\u2019re not exactly Marilyn Monroe\u2026\u201d/ a verdict I\u2019m still deconstructing.\u201d The poems in her catalogue often leave you feeling as if you\u2019ve been offered some bit of mysticism, and require you to return again and again to the page.\nOles speaks with a voice of wisdom, wit, and authority. This reading is not to be missed. Please join us for an exciting evening with Carole Simmons Oles, Monday, March 30th at 7:30pm in Colusa 100A. Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, Writer\u2019s Voice readings are free and open to the public.\nBy Natalie Windt\n\n \n\nMarch 28, 2015watershedcsuc\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll\n\nDiscuss\nGet Inspired\nGet Polling\nGet Support\nLearn WordPress.com\nTheme Showcase\nWordPress Planet\nWordPress.com News\n\n\nTopics\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nUpcoming Events No upcoming events\nArchives\n\nMay 2022\nMarch 2022\nMay 2020\nOctober 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nOctober 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nApril 2017\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nDecember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nApril 2014\nFebruary 2014\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nAugust 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\n\n \n\nFollow me on TwitterMy Tweets \n\n\n\n\nCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
