For these families\u2014and more than 177,000 alumni\u2014Chico State is not just a university or campus. It is the branches of the family tree. This is\u00a0one of six profiles\u00a0of families who are rooted in their Wildcat connection.\nEvone LaCombe and her son, Kevin, were familiar with seeing each other at school. She worked for the Willows Unified School District while Kevin (Kinesiology, \u201922) was a high school student. She also coached his 8th grade and junior varsity basketball teams, as well as his JV and varsity track teams.\nHowever, it was wholly different when the mother and son attended Chico State as undergraduates at the same time.\nKevin, 23, and Evone, 53, were overlapping kinesiology students for two semesters\u2014an experience the duo called unique and inspiring.\n\u201cIt was an interesting experience during my final years here to see my mom on campus and taking classes,\u201d he said. \u201cI never saw that happening.\u201d\nWhen Kevin enrolled at Chico State in 2018, his mom was at home after retiring for medical reasons. Thirteen years ago, Evone was diagnosed with lupus and had to be hospitalized. Once in remission and with medication, she wanted to advance the career she had to cut short.\n\u201cI had to give up coaching and then eventually my job because of my health, but I made the decision that I wasn\u2019t going to sit around and do nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cI started taking a couple of classes at Butte College, and once I finished, I transferred to Chico State and the kinesiology program because I\u2019ve always wanted to be a PE teacher.\u201d\nIt was amusing at times, Kevin said, running into his mom around campus, but also motivating and helpful.\nFor an online \u201cBiomechanics\u201d class they shared, Kevin drove from Chico to his mom\u2019s home in Willows to study alongside her. Their approaches to the class format and material were different, but they learned things from each other during their time as classmates. While Kevin kept his camera off during online classes and was experiencing a bout of senioritis, Evone turned on her camera and was elated to be in college.\n\n\nDriven and passionate about learning, the mother of three said that when there is something she wants to achieve, she makes it happen.\nKevin said it\u2019s impressive to see his mom restart school and thrive in her new environment. She\u2019s \u201cstarting from scratch\u201d and excelling in the classroom, he said. She is always networking in the department and it\u2019s great to see people in the program are eager to help her.\n\u201cI\u2019m inspired by my mom,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst off, she moved up from working in the cafeteria to overseeing the nutrition program for the (Willows) School District\u2014she leveled up in that career. Then she had to stop (working) after her illness but went on to pursue something else that she\u2019s always wanted to do.\u201d\nFor Evone, she often thinks about what she lost because it gives her perspective.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a blessing to be healthy again and to be able to pursue a career in kinesiology because I couldn\u2019t exercise for several years and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen people ask me what my hobby was, it was working out.\u201d\nBoth Kevin and Evone said they recognize that their shared college experience was rare and special, and they cherish the memories they created during their two semesters together.\nEvone distinctly remembers attending Kevin\u2019s graduation last year. She not only experienced a surge of pride to watch her son receive his diploma, but it served as a source of inspiration to push harder to finish her own college degree.\nKevin, in turn, said he is eagerly anticipating the opportunity to cheer on his mom when it\u2019s her turn to don her cap and gown this May.\n\n\nShare this Article\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tAlmendra Lawrence\t\t\n\n\n\t\tAlmendra (Journalism, '11) is a bilingual content producer that helps empower and inspire audiences through storytelling.
