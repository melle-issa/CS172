The Business Continuity Program helps to define an actionable plan for your department.\n    Frequently Asked QuestionsExpand All | Collapse AllField TripsQ: Where can I find information about field trips?A:\u00a0General information, policies and procedures can be found on the Risk Management web site under \u00a0Academic Field Trips & Off-Campus Activities.Q: When do I need to request a waiver?A:\u00a0Any time you take students out of town, provide transportation in town, or the risk is greater than the classroom environment, a waiver is needed.Q: How do I request a waiver? \u00a0A:\u00a0Refer to the Activity Assessment form  (PDF)for information and instructions.Q: Does a waiver need to be requested if our office is sponsoring a student to attend a conference?A:\u00a0Yes. If the campus is paying for any part of the travel or conference registration, making arrangements, providing transportation, giving academic credit, or faculty or staff are overseeing the outing, there should be a signed waiver on file.Q: What is the turnaround time for a waiver form?A:\u00a0Allow at least 10 business days.Q: How long do we retain the signed paper waiver forms? \u00a0A:\u00a0The original or digital copies of the signed waiver forms should be retained by the department for one (1) year after the end of the semester in which the trip/activity took place.Q: How long can students access the electronic waiver to accept an outing?A:\u00a0Students have until midnight on the start date of the field trip to access the electronic waiver.Q: For the electronic process, how do I access the waiver once the field trip is processed?A:\u00a0Faculty may log in to the field trip program(opens in new window), click on the field trip, click on the waiver button. You can view or print a copy of the waiver for students not able to access the electronic program.Q: If I used the electronic process, how do I access the roster? \u00a0A:\u00a0Faculty can log in to the field trip program(opens in new window), click on the field trip, click on the roster button.Q: For the electronic process, what do I do if students have not responded? \u00a0A:\u00a0Faculty can log in to the field trip program(opens in new window), click on the field trip, click on the option to send a reminder. This will send an email to students who have not responded to the initial request, and to students who may have added the class after the trip was created.Q: If I have several field trips during the semester, do I submit a separate request for each outing? \u00a0A:\u00a0If the activities associated with each trip are similar in nature, you can submit one request to cover the entire semester (Term Waiver). Please call Risk Management to discuss before requesting a Term Waiver.Q: I plan to use a charter bus service for the field trip, what do I need to do for Risk Management? \u00a0A:\u00a0Call Risk Management to ensure the University has insurance on file for the charter service. Submit a request for waiver form indicating the name of the charter bus company in the transportation details section.Q: When I submit a bus reservation request, does it automatically submit a field trip waiver request? \u00a0A:\u00a0No. The process for securing a bus reservation\u00a0is separate from the electronic field trip waiver process.Q: Which request should I submit first? Is there a preferred order? \u00a0A:\u00a0It is recommended that you submit the bus reservation request prior to the field trip request. Please ensure the field trip request is submitted at least 10 days prior to outing.Food Service ProvidersQ: How do I obtain the necessary insurance certificates and endorsements?A:\u00a0Talk to your insurance agent or broker. To make it really easy provide them with a copy of the CSU Requirements for Caterers and Food Service Providers.Q: What if my insurance agent/broker has questions? Can I have them call Risk Management directly?A:\u00a0Yes, by all means! We are happy to talk to your agent/broker and provide any additional information they may need. Our number is 530-898-6588.Q: Can my agent include the additional insured information on the certificate of insurance rather than attaching a separate form?A:\u00a0No, the certificate is for information purposes only and does not constitute a legal endorsement of additional insured.Q: What about when my insurance expires:A:\u00a0If your agent/broker has not forwarded a renewed certificate of insurance automatically, they will be sent a reminder notice.Q: I don't have employees. Do I need Workers' Compensation insurance coverage?A:\u00a0No, not if you are the sole practitioner and don't have employees.Q: I don't have employees of my own but I will be using employees from a temporary agency. Do they need Workers' Compensation insurance coverage?A:\u00a0Yes, they will need coverage but in most cases the temporary agency provides Workers' Compensation insurance coverage.Q: Does Risk Management need a copy of the temporary agency's Workers' Compensation insurance coverage?A:\u00a0YesQ: I will not be driving on grounds of CSU, Chico. Will I need automotive insurance coverage?A:\u00a0No, if you are not driving on CSU, Chico property.Q: I use a rental car to cater events and purchase automobile insurance coverage through the car rental agency. Will this suffice?A:\u00a0Yes, but we will need proof of coverage with adequate limits.Q: Where should my information be sent?A:\u00a0You can mail your documentation to:Director of Risk Management MSC 130 \u00a0California State University, Chico \u00a0400 W First St. \u00a0Chico, CA 95929-0130Or send via facsimile to 530-898-4513Student PlacementsQ: Does the University provide insurance for students who have been placed with outside agencies for various types of student placements such as internships, student teaching, or service learning?A:\u00a0Yes.
