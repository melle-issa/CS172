in Social Science is a flexible interdisciplinary program that allows students to tailor a program to their specific academic or career goals, drawing on curricula from departments in the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences, as well as history and other programs. While possibilities are varied, some examples include focusing on higher education administration, cultural and gender studies, and career development counseling.\nGraduate Advising Requirement\nAdvising is mandatory each semester for all Social Science majors. Failure to seek advising is considered a violation of normal progress towards the degree and can be grounds for removal from the program.\n\n\nRequirements for the MA in Social Science\nCompletion of all requirements as established by the Social Science graduate committee and Graduate Studies, to include:\n\nCompletion of an approved thematic program consisting of 30 units of 400/500/600-level courses as follows:\n\t\nAt least 18 units taken in the social sciences including coursework from at least two disciplines within the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences.\nAt least 18 units required for the degree at the 600 level.\nCompletion, with a grade of B or higher, of the approved research methods course and the Graduate Writing Proficiency course. These courses must be taken at the 600 level.\nAt the discretion of the academic program, a maximum of 30 percent of the units counted toward the degree requirements may be special session credit earned in non-matriculated status combined with all transfer coursework. This applies to special session credit earned through Open University, or in courses offered for academic credit through Professional & Continuing Education. Correspondence courses and UC Extension coursework are not acceptable for transfer.\nNot more than three units of either SOSC\u00a0660 or SOSC\u00a0689, approved by the Graduate Coordinator.\nNot more than a combined total of seven units of Independent Study (697) and Master's Thesis (699) or Master's Project (699); not more than six units of either Master's Thesis (699) or Master's Project (699), nor more than three units of Independent Study (697).\n\n\nCompletion and final approval of a culminating activity and successful completion of an oral defense. Students may choose a thesis or terminal project as specified by the student's graduate advisory committee and the Graduate Coordinator. A Comprehensive Exam and formal presentation may be chosen in lieu of thesis and oral defense with approval of the Graduate Coordinator.\nApproval by the Social Science Graduate Coordinator and the Graduate Council on behalf of the faculty of the University.\n\nGraduate Grading Requirements\nAll courses in the major (with the exceptions of Independent Study - 697, Comprehensive Examination - 696, Master's Project - 699P, and Master's Thesis - 699T) must be taken for a letter grade, except those courses specified by the department as ABC/No Credit (400/500-level courses), AB/No Credit (600-level courses), or Credit/No Credit grading only. A maximum of 10 units combined of ABC/No Credit, AB/No Credit, and Credit/No Credit grades may be used on the approved program (including 697, 696, 699P, 699T and courses outside the major). While grading standards are determined by individual programs and instructors, it is also the policy of the University that unsatisfactory grades may be given when work fails to reflect achievement of the high standards, including high writing standards, expected of students pursuing graduate study.\nStudents must maintain a minimum 3.0 grade point average in each of the following three categories: all coursework taken at any accredited institution subsequent to admission to the master's program; all coursework taken at California State University, Chico\u00a0subsequent to admission to the program; and all courses on the approved master's degree program.\nFor this program, grades lower than B- are unacceptable. Internship courses (689) will be graded Credit/No Credit only.\n\n\nContinuous enrollment is required. At the discretion of the academic program, a maximum of 30 percent of the units counted toward the degree requirements may be special session credit earned in non-matriculated status combined with all transfer coursework. This applies to special session credit earned through Open University, or in courses offered for academic credit through Professional & Continuing Education.\nGraduate Time Limit\nAll requirements for the degree are to be completed within five years of the end of the semester of enrollment in the oldest course applied toward the degree. See Master's Degree Requirements\u00a0for complete details on general degree requirements.\nThe Master of Arts in Social Science is designed for professionals having unique curricular needs within the behavioral and social sciences. It offers optimal flexibility in designing an individualized program specializing in an area related to behavioral and social sciences. The student can pursue a specific interdisciplinary theme, topic, or problem. The student is responsible for designing the course of study in conjunction with the graduate advisory committee and subject to the approval of the Graduate Coordinator.\nGraduate Requirement in Writing Proficiency\nAll students must demonstrate competency in writing skills as a requirement for graduation. This requirement must be met by successful completion, with a B or higher, of a Graduate Coordinator-approved Graduate Literacy course.\n\n\nPrerequisites for Admission to Conditionally Classified Status\n\nSatisfactory grade point average as specified in\u00a0Graduate and Postbaccalaureate Admission Requirements.\nApproval by the department and Graduate Studies.\nAn acceptable baccalaureate from an accredited institution, or an equivalent approved by Graduate Studies. If the applicant's previous work is deficient in the social sciences, the applicant may be required to take some prerequisite courses as appropriate to the program of study.\nTwo letters of recommendation.\nSubmission of a statement of purpose for the program describing the applicant's background and career or academic goals, and preparation for Social Science graduate studies.\n\nPrerequisites for Admission to Classified Status\nIn addition to any requirements listed above:\n\nCompletion of at least one of the following:\n\t\nA grade point average of 3.25 or higher in the last 60 units of course work taken.\nA cumulative undergraduate grade point average of at least 3.0.\nCompletion of 12 units in the program with a minimum of a 3.0 grade point average including the research methods course that requires a grade of B or higher.\nDevelopment of an approved plan in consultation with the Social Science graduate coordinator, the graduate advisory committee, and Graduate Studies.\n\n\n\nAdvancement to Candidacy\nIn addition to any requirements listed above:\n\nThe student must have classified graduate standing and must have completed at least 18 units of the proposed program at the University.\nRecent completion of a research methods course appropriate to the program of study (consult Graduate Coordinator) with a grade of B or higher.\nRecent completion of a Graduate Writing Proficiency course as assigned/approved by the Graduate Coordinator. The Graduate Writing Proficiency course may be any one of various 600 level courses that require significant scientific writing in the field(s) of study and must be approved by the Graduate Coordinator.\nFormation of the Graduate Advisory Committee, which must include two faculty from the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences and a minimum of two tenure/tenure track faculty in consultation with the Graduate Coordinator.\nDevelopment of an approved program plan in consultation with the Graduate Coordinator, including a statement describing the student's interest in the special program being proposed, previous academic training, other relevant experience, and a description of the particular theme, topic, or problem the student proposes to study.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nphone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\nlight bulb\n\n\nNeed Help?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport an\n\t\t\t\t\t\taccessibility issue\n\n\nReport a broken link on this page\n\n\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia State University, Chico\n400 West First Street\nChico, CA 95929\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023-2024 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\nClose this window\n\nPrint Options\n\n\n\n\nSend Page to Printer\nPrint this page.\n\nDownload Page (PDF)The PDF will include all information unique to this page. \n\n\n",
