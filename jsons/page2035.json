I'm the author of https://wordpress.org/plugins/turbo-admin/ and a huge proponent of command palettes and keyboard navigation.\nI'd like to link some other prior art and resources that may be useful:\n\nkbar is a pre-existing, open source, extensible React component command palette. This would almost certainly make an awesome off-the shelf front-end that would fit really well with WordPress.\nStreamline is a paid-for command palette/search tool\nCommand Bar is a commercial offering with some nice features.\n\nSome thoughts/experiences from me:\n\nThe key to activate this needs to be either chosen really carefully and testing across multiple browsers, or it needs to be customisable. I would suggest both. Cmd/Ctrl-K is kinda standard. But some code editors/IDEs use Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-P, but beware of this because some browsers (Firefox, I think) have it reserved.\nI love the idea of this being extensible but there must be limits! We do not want crazy ads and upsells injected into here.\nThis should, preferably, work across all parts of the Dashboard, not just inside the editor.\nI note that some parts of the editor are hard to \"action\" because they are not necessarily <a> tags or <buttons> but rather React-activated elements that are not always visible. This will, I suppose, be easier if the command palette is itself a React component that has awareness of available actions on a page. But I say this to note the difference between those actions and most other things that can be activated using URLs.\n\nHope that's useful. I very much support this idea and would love to stay involved in whatever ways I can, even though I'm doing myself out of a job!! :-)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u2764\ufe0f\n5\n tomdevisser, annezazu, priethor, carolinan, and danielbachhuber reacted with heart emoji\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n5 reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\n\n\n\nrosswintle\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Feb 27, 2023\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n          edited\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther things:\n\nThis is NOT a simple piece of UI. There are a lot of intricacies (I\u2019m sure you would anticipate this, but it\u2019s worth saying!)\n(Some) people want dark mode! :face_with_rolling_eyes: \ud83d\ude06\nGeneral principles of modal UX apply.\nExtensibility would be awesome, but there has to be limits. We don\u2019t want plugins injecting all sorts of nonsense into it. I don\u2019t know how that can be enforced.\nFuzzy search is a must, but how you handle the difference between commands/actions and search is an issue. I decided on keywords to switch into search modes, a bit like how Alfred works on MacOS.\nDiscoverability was an issue for some. People didn\u2019t know it was there. So I gave them the option to put it in the admin bar as a global search box rather than as a pop-up/modal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u2764\ufe0f\n4\n tomdevisser, annezazu, priethor, and danielbachhuber reacted with heart emoji\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n4 reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nleeoniya\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Mar 1, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaybe helpful: https://github.com/leeoniya/uFuzzy#a-biased-appraisal-of-similar-work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMember\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\nmtias\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Mar 1, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@rosswintle thanks for chiming in and the offer to collaborate! kbar was definitely on my mind. I also quite like cmdk.paco.me. @richtabor also has some prior art within the WP dashboard.\nThe editor focus is just a step in the direction, the hope is to have something that expands beyond and would be part of a more global search, not just invoked via keyboard shortcuts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u2764\ufe0f\n1\n richtabor reacted with heart emoji\n \ud83d\ude80\n2\n richtabor and annezazu reacted with rocket emoji\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n1 reaction\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\n2 reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\nContributor\n\n\n\n\n\ngravityrail\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Mar 3, 2023\n\n\u2022\n\n\n\n\n          edited\n          \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would definitely like to make it pluggable so that plugins can enhance it with cloud-based functionality.\nImagine this: it submits the AST of the current editor contents to a service, and can receive back a series of transformations that can be applied to the current document (these could be the same transformations we use to do collaborative editing, which I assume someone's looking at).\nThose transformations can be applied to the current document in a reversible way. So you can say \"align the banner image to the right\" and then get back a transformation that does that, and if you don't like it you can reject the change.\nIn the simplest case, of course, the transformation might just search for and insert a block (which can be accomplished without any fancy cloud stuff) but doing it this way makes it infinitely extensible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrichtabor\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nMar 22, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n      Adds a modal version of the block inserter only in Distraction Free mode\n      #44932\n \n\n\n Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npriethor\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nMar 22, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n      Try/command center\n      #49152\n \n\n\n Closed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyouknowriad\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nMar 24, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n      Add a command center to the site editor. \n      #49330\n \n\n\n Merged\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub-actions\nbot\n\n\n\n          assigned     youknowriad\nMar 24, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngithub-actions\nbot\n\n\n\n        added\n  the \n\n  [Status] In Progress\n\nTracking issues with work in progress\n label\n\n\n    Mar 24, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalexstandiford\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Mar 25, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would suggest both.
