Here on the Farm it\u2019s a busy time of many activities, and the height of many students\u2019 academic work for the quarter, with the promise of a restful and restorative winter break not far off.\nI\u2019m writing to share some updates about student life, and the ways we are working to support an engaging and fun experience on campus. I wrote to students about these same issues earlier today, and you can read that letter here.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSamuel SantosAssociate Vice Provost for Inclusion, Community and Integrative LearningVice Provost for Student Affairs\n\nA vibrant social life is an important part of the Stanford experience. Belonging and meaningful connection with others are essential to the wellbeing of college students. And, in an academic environment as rigorous as Stanford\u2019s, we know it\u2019s also critical for students to\u00a0 be able to step away and just have fun. Stanford\u2019s spirit of exuberance and irreverence is one part of why many students choose to come here.\nHowever, we\u2019ve heard concerns from students who feel the social experience on campus isn\u2019t meeting their hopes and expectations. We take this seriously and want to make progress on it.\nAs we have been coming out of the pandemic and returning to our fully in-person residential experience on campus, we\u2019ve been working with students to rebuild social opportunities.\u00a0\nThis fall there have been socials, barbecues and special dinners based in the residences; student-organized parties; the restoration of Stanford traditions like Band Run and Mausoleum; social events in The Arbor gathering space on the back patio of Tresidder; the Cardinal Nights program of alcohol-free events; and intramural sports as well as opportunities for students to cheer on our varsity Cardinal teams.\nThis week is Big Game Week, which features the popular live performance of the student-written comedy Gaieties, our annual Big Game rally on campus, and competitions with Cal in several sports culminating in Big Game on Saturday.\nBut we\u2019re planning to do more.\nWe\u2019re asking for your students\u2019 input. We know that different students seek different kinds of social opportunities, reflecting the diversity of interests and identities in our community. We\u2019ve provided a web form for students to provide ideas on social opportunities they\u2019d like to see at Stanford. I\u2019m also inviting students to meet with me individually or in small groups to share their experiences and suggestions.\nWe\u2019ve also had a Social Life Accelerator Task Force, made up of students, staff and alumni, examining opportunities for enhancing social life. This fall we\u2019ve already implemented a dozen short-term ideas from the task force, and we\u2019re awaiting some longer-term recommendations from the group now. I also launched a Greek Alumni Advisory Council this quarter to help gather alumni input on this and other issues impacting our student Greek letter organizations.\u00a0\u00a0\nWe\u2019re also working to improve campus processes around social life. This includes streamlining\u00a0 the party planning process for students, looking at additional funding and space possibilities for student social events, and examining how to improve the flow of information to students about the social opportunities available to them, among other things.\nWe want to continue to support students in creating social opportunities that are safe, inclusive, and truly fun in the best traditions of Stanford. We will share more in winter quarter as we work through these efforts and gather more input. In the meantime, more information about these issues can be found in this FAQ on our website.\u00a0\u00a0\nSincerely,\nSamuel Santos Jr.\nAssociate Vice Provost \nInclusion, Community and Integrative Learning\n \nPost navigation\n\n Previous postWelcome to the new academic year: A message from vice provosts Susie Brubaker-Cole, Sarah Church\nNext postQ&A With Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education Sarah Church \u2014 The Major Declaration Journey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategories\n\nAcademics at Stanford (83)\n\nAlcohol at Stanford (16)\n\nCareer Education (3)\n\nFinances at Stanford (12)\n\nHealth at Stanford (40)\n\nLiving at Stanford (60)\n\nParents Program (5)\n\nParents' Club (4)\n\nSafety at Stanford (41)\n\nStanford Events (56)\n\nUncategorized (14)\n\n\n\n\nArchives\nArchives\n\nSelect Month\n April 2023 \u00a0(1)\n November 2022 \u00a0(1)\n September 2022 \u00a0(1)\n April 2022 \u00a0(1)\n February 2022 \u00a0(1)\n November 2021 \u00a0(1)\n September 2021 \u00a0(3)\n August 2021 \u00a0(1)\n June 2021 \u00a0(4)\n May 2021 \u00a0(4)\n April 2021 \u00a0(3)\n March 2021 \u00a0(4)\n February 2021 \u00a0(5)\n January 2021 \u00a0(2)\n December 2020 \u00a0(1)\n September 2020 \u00a0(3)\n August 2020 \u00a0(2)\n July 2020 \u00a0(1)\n June 2020 \u00a0(4)\n May 2020 \u00a0(3)\n March 2020 \u00a0(3)\n February 2020 \u00a0(2)\n January 2020 \u00a0(2)\n December 2019 \u00a0(1)\n November 2019 \u00a0(2)\n October 2019 \u00a0(5)\n September 2019 \u00a0(4)\n August 2019 \u00a0(2)\n July 2019 \u00a0(3)\n June 2019 \u00a0(3)\n May 2019 \u00a0(3)\n April 2019 \u00a0(2)\n March 2019 \u00a0(2)\n February 2019 \u00a0(6)\n January 2019 \u00a0(3)\n December 2018 \u00a0(1)\n November 2018 \u00a0(2)\n October 2018 \u00a0(2)\n September 2018 \u00a0(4)\n August 2018 \u00a0(2)\n May 2018 \u00a0(4)\n April 2018 \u00a0(2)\n March 2018 \u00a0(6)\n February 2018 \u00a0(4)\n January 2018 \u00a0(1)\n November 2017 \u00a0(4)\n October 2017 \u00a0(3)\n September 2017 \u00a0(5)\n August 2017 \u00a0(5)\n July 2017 \u00a0(2)\n June 2017 \u00a0(2)\n May 2017 \u00a0(5)\n April 2017 \u00a0(3)\n March 2017 \u00a0(4)\n February 2017 \u00a0(2)\n January 2017 \u00a0(3)\n December 2016 \u00a0(3)\n October 2016 \u00a0(3)\n September 2016 \u00a0(4)\n August 2016 \u00a0(2)\n July 2016 \u00a0(3)\n June 2016 \u00a0(3)\n May 2016 \u00a0(2)\n April 2016 \u00a0(4)\n March 2016 \u00a0(2)\n February 2016 \u00a0(8)\n January 2016 \u00a0(3)\n December 2015 \u00a0(2)\n November 2015 \u00a0(7)\n October 2015 \u00a0(2)\n September 2015 \u00a0(7)\n August 2015 \u00a0(1)\n July 2015 \u00a0(3)\n June 2015 \u00a0(5)\n May 2015 \u00a0(1)\n April 2015 \u00a0(3)\n March 2015 \u00a0(3)\n February 2015 \u00a0(1)\n January 2015 \u00a0(1)\n December 2014 \u00a0(1)\n November 2014 \u00a0(1)\n October 2014 \u00a0(4)\n September 2014 \u00a0(3)\n June 2014 \u00a0(3)\n May 2014 \u00a0(1)\n April 2014 \u00a0(2)\n March 2014 \u00a0(1)\n February 2014 \u00a0(5)\n January 2014 \u00a0(2)\n November 2013 \u00a0(1)\n October 2013 \u00a0(1)\n September 2013 \u00a0(3)\n August 2013 \u00a0(1)\n June 2013 \u00a0(1)\n April 2013 \u00a0(2)\n March 2013 \u00a0(5)\n February 2013 \u00a0(1)\n December 2012 \u00a0(3)\n September 2012 \u00a0(3)\n June 2012 \u00a0(1)\n May 2012 \u00a0(2)\n February 2012 \u00a0(1)\n January 2012 \u00a0(2)\n December 2011 \u00a0(4)\n November 2011 \u00a0(1)\n August 2011 \u00a0(2)\n May 2011 \u00a0(1)\n April 2011 \u00a0(1)\n February 2011 \u00a0(1)\n January 2011 \u00a0(2)\n October 2010 \u00a0(1)\n August 2010 \u00a0(1)\n July 2010 \u00a0(1)\n March 2010 \u00a0(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nNewsletter\n\nEmail newsletter archive\n \n\n\n\n\n\nStanford + Parents/Guardians\n The student is at the center \u2014 and is the focus \u2014 of this important partnership.\n\nOur Policy\nProspective Parents\n\n\n  \n\nParents' Helpline\n\nmykidis@stanford.edu\n650-725-0649\n \n\n\n  \n\nIn an Emergency\n\nemergency.stanford.edu\n650-725-5555\n 844-ALERTSU (844-253-7878)  \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Home\nMaps & Directions\nSearch Stanford\nEmergency Info\n\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy\nCopyright\nTrademarks\nNon-Discrimination\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University,  Stanford, California 94305.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n",
