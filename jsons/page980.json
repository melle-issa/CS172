Growth can be seen in many forms but staying in your comfort zone is not one of them.\u201d\nKhan\u2019s empowered perspective on her situation has shaped her academic career.\nToday she is a senior preparing to graduate with one degree in business administration with an option in finance and another in business information systems with an option in management information systems. Khan ultimately sees her educational journey as an extension of two key lessons that began with her move to California: growing through mistakes and embracing mentors.\nKhan at her EOP workspace in the Student Services Center building. \nBy 2019, she enrolled at Chico State with the intention of majoring in biochemistry and pursuing a career in the medical field. Within her first semester, she knew this was not the right path for her. The work felt frustrating and didn\u2019t allow her strengths to take center stage. \u201cI tried really hard but couldn\u2019t get into it. I\u2019m so glad that I took that chemistry class in my first semester and realized how much I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nDuring Summer Bridge, a transition program that brings first-year EOP students to campus before the semester starts to meet mentors, attend workshops, and get familiar with student life, Khan met her future adviser, Jennifer Duggan, assistant dean with the College of Business. Duggan immediately saw her dedication and academic enthusiasm, and the two built a mentor-mentee relationship based on their initial connection. Ultimately, Duggan would help Khan find her place in the business majors, setting her on a course for success.\n\u201cSince meeting Hirra, she has shown a fierce determination to succeed academically,\u201d Duggan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been impressed with her focus and discipline to maintain a high GPA in a difficult STEM major. It\u2019s been a joy to watch her excel and reach her goal of graduating with this impressive double major.\u201d\nThis shift in Khan\u2019s focus toward business has allowed her to access new gears within herself and find an area of study that captivates her and holds promise in the working world.\n\u201cThe combination of MIS with finance really works for me,\u201d Khan said. \u201cI love numbers, analytics, and the financial side of my degree, and then MIS brings in a technology aspect, which is something I find very interesting.\u201d In addition to being a sound analytical problem solver, she has proven to be an effective communicator and project manager in and out of the classroom.\nIn fact, it was a business communications class during her second year, which included writing cover letters and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, that prompted Khan to take the initiative and apply for a job with EOP. This began another important chapter in her story, where she could give back to the organization that helped set her up for success at Chico State. Khan\u2019s first supervisor, Xia \u201cBilly\u201d Lo, was a positive influence and mentor who supported her in this new role, in which she has grown from strength to strength. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cShe carries herself very confidently\u2014she has a strong character, but she\u2019s very quiet and she\u2019s always listening,\u201d said Teresa Hernandez, a coordinator with EOP\u2019s freshman year experience program and Khan\u2019s current supervisor for the last year. \u201cThat\u2019s a very intriguing thing about her. She can be seen as someone who hangs in the background of a busy room, but then she can instantly command the attention of that room and get everyone focused on her. She\u2019s a true leader in that way. I know she is going to be a very impactful person in every role she takes on.\u201d\nAs someone who benefitted from EOP as a first-year student, Khan sees her work for the program as an important way of giving back to the students she advises now. \u201cI think EOP creates a sense of home at Chico State,\u201d Khan said. \u201cMost students have similar backgrounds\u2014they\u2019re first-generation students, often coming from far away\u2014and we can connect on that experience. We\u2019re there to listen to them, understand what they need, and offer support, whether that\u2019s a referral or just listening.\u201d\nKhan\u2019s impact with students is tangible, according to Hernandez. \u201cHirra has a very calming presence\u2014she\u2019s able to bring students down who might be feeling riled up or upset or worried,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThe way she provides advice and motivation for them, so that they leave here feeling inspired to keep going and keep trying, is one of the most important things.\u201d\nIn addition to Khan\u2019s work with EOP, she is also a volunteer with AmeriCorps, serving adult learners in an open capacity that ranges from help with English as a second language course material to tutor training.\u00a0\nBeyond the lessons she\u2019s learned, a constant grounding force and source of inspiration in Khan\u2019s life is her family and network. Her sister, Amna (Business Information Systems, \u201921), and best friend Veronica Heredia, also a senior and majoring in human resources, have provided encouragement and positive affirmation at her most difficult moments. \u201cMoving here was hard, but I\u2019ve had a lot of family support to help me through,\u201d Khan said. \u201cMy mom, especially. She is someone I have always admired\u2014she has this emotional, inner strength and self-control that is inspirational.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nBeyond graduation, Khan is looking forward to challenging herself in the workforce, bringing her talents to a role that combines the strengths and skills that she has developed at Chico State.\n\u201cI grew up pretty shy, and I guess I still am in some situations, but I\u2019m also sure that I am a leader,\u201d she said. \u201cMy confidence and skills have really grown through my work at and school and EOP, and I\u2019m ready to take on a new challenge.\u201d\nWhen she says this, we believe her.\n\n\nShare this Article\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tClayton Truscott\t\t\n\n\n\t\tCommunications Manager Clayton Truscott leads storytelling and content development efforts for University Communications.\t\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular \n\n\t\t\t\t\tBusiness Double Major Ready for Life\u2019s Next Big Challenge\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tExpanded CalFresh Eligibility Brings Food Access to More Chico State Students\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWorth Sharing: Health Services Administration College Bowl Team Scores Wins\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLife of Hard Work Pays Off for Agricultural Business Major\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRooted in Connection: The Wildcat Family Tree\t\t\t\t\n\n\nSubscribe to Chico State Today\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tType your email\u2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nChico State Today is an official site of California State University, Chico.\nReport an accessibility issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChico State\n\n\n\nCalifornia State University, Chico\n400 West First Street\nChico, CA 95929\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose Subscribe Pop-Up\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tClose Subscribe Pop-Up\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
