Global Activities\n                      \n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority\nThis Guide Memo was approved by the President.\n\n\n\n\nLast Updated\nJuly 25, 2017\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\nFormerly Known As Policy Number: 15.5\nThis Guide Memo establishes the policies governing use of Stanford's registered trademarks, as well as the use of unregistered names, seals, logos, emblems, images, symbols and slogans that are representative of Stanford (together referred to herein as \"Marks\").\nApplicability:\nThis Guide Memo applies to all uses of Stanford's Marks.\n1. Marks\nStanford\u2019s Marks are owned by Stanford and they are a valuable university asset.\u00a0 Faculty, students, staff and alumni share in the benefits associated with the Marks, and therefore also share responsibilities to ensure correct use.\u00a0 Stanford\u2019s Trademark Licensing Office at trademarks@stanford.edu is to be consulted with any questions about Stanford\u2019s Marks and their use.\u00a0\u00a0\na. Registered Marks\nA partial list of Stanford\u2019s registered Marks includes, but is not limited to:\nThe word \u201cStanford\u201d\nThe Block \"S\" with tree emblem\nThe Stanford University seal\nThe Office of the General Counsel maintains a complete list of registered Marks.\nb. Unregistered Marks\nA partial list of Stanford\u2019s unregistered Marks includes, but is not limited to:\nThe word \u201cCardinal\u201d\n\u201cFarm\u201d or \u201cThe Farm\u201d\nThe phrase \u201cFear the Tree\u201d\nBlock \u201cS\u201d without tree emblem\nTrademark Licensing maintains a complete list of unregistered Marks.\nc. Buildings and Landmarks\nAll buildings and landmarks that are generally recognizable as being located on Stanford\u2019s campus or associated with Stanford are considered to be Marks. These images include, but are not limited to:\nHoover Tower\nMemorial Church\nPalm Drive\nThe Oval\nThe Main Quad\nMemorial Courtyard\nBing Concert Hall\nCantor Arts Center\nStanford Stadium\nThe Engineering Quad\nThe Knight Management Center\n2. Authority\nThe President has delegated authority for approving use of Stanford's Marks as follows:\na. Provost\nFor use in connection with educational, research and athletics activities (including courseware and related materials developed for teaching at Stanford) and for special events.\nb. Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer\nFor use by manufacturers of merchandise and products, in connection with Stanford\u2019s business activities, and by vendors (including promotional use). Only the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer may grant permission for use of Stanford's Marks on merchandise and products.\u00a0\nc. Dean of the School of Medicine\nFor use in connection with Stanford Medicine\u2019s activities.\u00a0\nd. Vice President for University Communications\nFor use in film, video, print and digital media, including the University's web pages.\u00a0\ne. General Counsel\nFor use in connection with legal affairs.\nAuthority for approving all other uses of Stanford\u2019s Marks remains with the President.\nThese individuals, or their delegates, will collaborate on situations that fall within the scope of authority of more than one office in order to ensure a consistent application of this policy.\n3. Use of Marks\na. General\nStanford\u2019s Marks may only be used by Stanford faculty, staff, students, and alumni as provided in this policy and for no other purposes. Stanford faculty and staff include only those individuals who meet the criteria listed in Sections 1 through 11 of Administrative Guide Memo 2.2.1: Definitions. Students include only individuals currently enrolled in a degree-granting program at Stanford. Alumni include only individuals who have completed at least three quarters of a degree-granting program at Stanford. No other individuals or entities may use Stanford\u2019s Marks without the permission of an individual listed in Section 2, above, or their delegate.\u00a0\u00a0\nb. Faculty and Staff\nStanford faculty and staff may only use Stanford\u2019s Marks in connection with Stanford departments, institutes, events, programs, projects, activities, publications and products that are officially sponsored or sanctioned by Stanford.\nWhen a faculty or staff member is involved in activities that are not officially sponsored or sanctioned by Stanford (such as independent consulting, outside business activities, civic and volunteer work, and publications), use of Stanford's name and marks is limited to identification of the individual\u2019s Stanford affiliation (e.g., Jane Smith, Professor of History, Stanford University). Stanford\u2019s seal and other emblems may not be used.\u00a0\nThe Trademark Licensing Office (trademarks@stanford.edu) is to be consulted before using Stanford\u2019s Marks on any product, in a book title, in the name of any non-Stanford business or activity, or in the name of a course or program that is not owned by Stanford.\u00a0\nFaculty and staff members may not grant permission for use of Stanford\u2019s Marks to individuals and entities outside of Stanford without consultation with the Office of the Vice President for Business Affairs and Chief Financial Officer (trademarks@stanford.edu), which will then consult with the appropriate individual with delegated authority as specified in Section 2, above. This prohibition includes granting permission to (a) vendors and others in a business relationship with Stanford, (b) research sponsors, (c) donors, and (d) industrial affiliate program members.\u00a0\u00a0\nAll use of Stanford\u2019s Marks in film, video, print and digital media (including in press releases) must comply with this Administrative Guide, as well as the policies established by University Communications (brandmanager@stanford.edu).\u00a0\nThis policy is not intended to limit use of the Stanford\u2019s Marks in situations that fall within the normal scope of Stanford\u2019s activities as a residential academic institution, as a research institution and as an employer. In these instances, Stanford's Marks may be used in accordance with the review processes established by schools, departments, centers and programs so long as the uses approved are consistent with the policies included in this Administrative Guide.\u00a0\nc. Students and Alumni\nStudents and alumni may only use Stanford\u2019s Marks as described below:\nStudents and alumni may use Stanford\u2019s name, but no other Marks, to identify their attendance at and degrees from Stanford on resumes and on digital channels such as personal web sites and social media.\u00a0\u00a0\nUndergraduate and graduate students may use Stanford\u2019s name and the Block S with tree emblem on business cards which identify their student status. The approved business card format is included in the Identity Toolkit. Alumni may not use Stanford Marks on business cards.\u00a0\nStudents and alumni may use Stanford\u2019s Marks in connection with the University-sanctioned activities of student and alumni groups that have received and maintain official ASSU or Stanford Alumni Association recognition, respectively. When the Marks are used in these instances, it must be clear that the activity is either a student activity or an alumni activity, and not a University activity.\u00a0\u00a0\nOnly recognized student and alumni groups may produce merchandise that incorporates Stanford Marks. Such merchandise may only be produced in connection with University-sanctioned activities and must comply with all policies and procedures established by the Trademark Licensing Office for licensed product.\u00a0\nd. Additional Considerations\nUse of Stanford\u2019s Marks must comply with the following:\nIn all situations, use of Marks by an authorized individual or entity must be consistent with Stanford\u2019s academic and research mission and its reputation for excellence.\u00a0\u00a0\nAll uses of Stanford\u2019s Marks must comply with applicable policies and guidelines, including those included in the Trademark Licensing website, the Identity Toolkit, the Name Use Guidelines, and all other policies and guidelines listed in Section 8, below.\u00a0\nAll uses of Stanford\u2019s Marks must carry proper trademark designations, as established by the Office of the General Counsel and specified on the Trademark Licensing website. This includes \u00ae on registered marks and TM on unregistered Marks when required.\u00a0\nStanford\u2019s Marks may never be altered or combined with another organization\u2019s name or logo without permission from Stanford\u2019s President, Provost or other individual with delegated authority under Section 2, above.\n4. Prohibited Use of Marks\nThe following uses of Stanford\u2019s Marks are not permitted, except as otherwise authorized by (a) this policy, (b) the Name Use Guidelines, (c) other published guidelines or (d) Stanford\u2019s President, Provost or other individual with delegated authority under Section 2, above:\nBy non-Stanford individuals and entities. This includes, but is not limited to, vendors, technology licensees, research funders, donors, industrial affiliate program members, collaborators, partners and guest speakers.\u00a0\nIn a manner that endorses or implies endorsement of (a) a non-Stanford entity, or (b) the programs, products or services of a non-Stanford entity.\u00a0\nBy faculty, staff, students, alumni or others in association with any commercial activity or outside venture.\u00a0\nIn situations which will negatively impact Stanford\u2019s reputation, or which may have the potential to impact negatively Stanford\u2019s reputation. Such situations include, but are not limited to, use of Marks in connection with materials which (i) violate any law or regulation, (ii) have the potential to offend a person or group on the basis of gender, ethnic origin, religion, race, disability or sexual orientation, (iii) could be considered to be pornographic, or (iv) could be considered to be defamatory.\u00a0\nIn connection with partisan political activities. See Administrative Guide Memo 1.5.1: Political, Campaign and Lobbying Activities.\nInvolvement by individual faculty, staff, students, or alumni in a non-Stanford activity is not a sufficient basis for indicating University sponsorship or endorsement and Marks may not be used in connection with such activities.\n5. Trademark Licensing Program\nAll merchandise bearing any Marks must be produced by a licensed vendor and be approved by Stanford\u2019s Trademark Licensing Office. The Trademark Licensing Office will issue or approve all licenses, issue guidelines governing the production, sale and other distribution of licensed merchandise, and manage Stanford\u2019s trademark licensing program. All merchandise produced for sale (including items that are sold to cover the cost of production) will be royalty-bearing at the rate established by the Trademark Licensing Office. Only items that are produced for internal use by Stanford, and are not offered for re-sale, are not royalty-bearing. Net proceeds from Stanford\u2019s trademark licensing program royalties are used to support undergraduate financial aid and the Department of Athletics and Physical Education.\u00a0\n6. Registrations\na. Domain Names\nDomain names that incorporate the words \"Stanford\" or \"Cardinal\" may only be registered in the name of the Board of Trustees of Stanford University and may only be used in connection with activities that are officially sponsored or sanctioned by Stanford.\nb. Marks\nTrademarks for the University may only be registered in the name of The Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University and may only be used in connection with activities that are officially sponsored or sanctioned by Stanford. The Office of the General Counsel is responsible for registration of all trademarks for the University.\n7. Enforcement of Rights\nThe University will actively protect its Marks from improper or misleading use by individuals or organizations not associated with Stanford and will ensure that use of Marks by Stanford faculty, students, staff, alumni, schools, departments, institutes, centers and programs conforms to all applicable policies and guidelines. The Office of the General Counsel is responsible for enforcement of Stanford's Marks.\n8.
