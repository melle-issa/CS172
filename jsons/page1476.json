Chapman grad school experience, during which he is learning both the art and business of filmmaking. \n\n\n\n\nArts & Film \nChapman Film Student Takes Industry OnRamp to Breakthrough at Tribeca Festival As his comedy feature \u201cFour Samosas\u201d generates buzz, Venk Potula (MBA/MFA \u201923) applies new career skills to create his own opportunities. \n Dennis ArpJune 21, 20224 min read\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re too different,\u201d Venk Potula has been told by more than one casting director. \u201cYou won\u2019t have a career because there\u2019s not enough work for you,\u201d a Hollywood agent once counseled.\n\u201cAs a dark-skinned South Asian person, I\u2019m often defined by my race,\u201d Potula lamented. \u201cThey make judgments about what I can do and parts I can play based on what I can\u2019t control.\u201d\nSo after a decade of discouragement at the hands of entertainment industry gatekeepers, Potula decided to build his own gate.\nHe enrolled in Chapman University\u2019s Industry OnRamp Program, a post-graduate program that provides cross-disciplinary career prep for creatives who want to develop their own movies, TV shows and other projects.\nStudying with industry mentors, Potula and other Chapman grad students are learning the business as well as the art of filmmaking \u2013 from securing funding and legal representation to marketing and distribution.\n\u201cThe program is designed so that many more Duffer Brothers will be launched from Chapman, where they can meet their future lawyer, agent and manager,\u201d said program director Judd Funk, referring to Matt and Ross Duffer \u201907, Chapman graduates and creators of the hit Netflix series \u201cStranger Things.\u201d\nNow Potula (MBA/MFA \u201923) is taking his career into his own hands thanks to the program, which taps the expertise of professors and mentors from Dodge College of Film and Media Arts, Argyros School of Business and Economics, and Fowler School of Law.\nTribeca Festival Provides Opportunity to Network and Pursue Deals\nPotula is already applying his lessons as a producer and star of the indie film \u201cFour Samosas,\u201d which generated buzz surrounding its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on June 10 in New York City.\nThe first screening of the quirky comedy sold out in 10 minutes.\n\u201cWe have a great team, a good business plan and momentum on our side,\u201d Potula said.\n\u201cFour Samosas,\u201d written and directed by Ravi Kapoor, tells the story of wanna-be rapper Vinny (Potula), who talks his friends into helping him steal his ex-girlfriend\u2019s dowry jewels. Reviewers have lauded the film\u2019s \u201cgenuine laughs\u201d and \u201cglorious lunacy.\u201d At the Tribeca Festival, which concluded June 19, Potula and producing partners Kapoor, Rajiv Maikhuri and Craig Stovel courted support that includes distribution deals.\nSuch deal-making was not on Potula\u2019s radar when he moved to Los Angeles from his native Atlanta 11 years ago, first to attend UCLA\u2019s School of Theater, Film and Television and then to pursue a professional acting career.\nHe has co-created and starred in scripted comedy podcasts, and he directed the indie short \u201cWoke,\u201d in which he also starred. But \u201cFour Samosas\u201d is the first feature film for which Potula has taken on the role of producer.\nGrad Program That Unites Film, Business and Law Becomes \u2018Relevant and Useful\u2019\nWith the project, everything he\u2019s learning in his OnRamp Program \u201cbecame relevant and useful,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMy statistics course is really helpful, and so is data analytics. The economics course applies because you\u2019re thinking about supply and demand, price points and evaluating the market,\u201d Potula said. \u201cIt\u2019s all business, it\u2019s all storytelling, and it\u2019s all relevant.\u201d\nAfter being thwarted and pigeonholed as an actor, Potula has hit the career accelerator as an actor-producer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a complete surprise that Venk has already landed a feature in one of the world\u2019s premier festivals,\u201d said Dodge College Associate Professor Travis Knox \u201993, a mentor in Potula\u2019s MBA/MFA in Film and Television Producing program. \u201cHe\u2019s entrepreneurial, tenacious and outgoing. You add good taste to the mix and there\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s looking forward to a successful producing career.\u201d\nFunk, a Fowler Law and Dodge film professor who formerly headed the legal department at Universal, sees Potula growing in every facet of filmmaking.\n\u201cHe\u2019s enormously talented as an actor, but he\u2019s also resourceful, which you have to be as a producer, especially when you\u2019ve had doors shut in your face again and again,\u201d Funk said. \u201cVenk is wonderfully engaging. That\u2019s important when you\u2019re negotiating.\u201d\nPotula describes himself as naturally curious, so the program is perfect for him, he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m constantly bugging everyone for advice,\u201d he added. \u201cI could go through every class and tell you something I\u2019ve taken from it that\u2019s helping me. When Chapman talks about a personalized education, that\u2019s as personalized as it gets.\u201d\nSo as he collaborated with the \u201cFour Samosas\u201d team at the Tribeca Festival, Potula felt prepared to make the most of the opportunities he helped create for himself.\nStill, in the run-up to the festival, there was at least one more gatekeeper he was angling to get past: the person granting access to the \u201cFour Samosas\u201d screening room.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, we sold out so quickly, my seat may not be guaranteed,\u201d Potula said with a grin.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nChapman in Hollywood MBA/MFA in Film and TV Producing OnRamp Program \n\n\n\n\n \n\nDennis Arp \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDean Thomas Turk Leaves a Legacy of Growth at the Argyros School\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Wall Family Scholars Program to Support STEM Students Pursuing MBA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Asia-Pacific Initiative Offers Unique Take on Hotbed Region Growing up in Los Angeles, Robert Koepp became fascinated with Asia.
