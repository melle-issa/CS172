In a recent update, Yoast-sponsored core contributor Ari Stathopoulos said the SQLite Database Integration feature plugin has been rewritten, with the help of Automattic-sponsored core contributor Adam Zielinski, to be a more future-proof implementation.\n\u201cThe code has been completely rewritten to use an SQL Lexer and is now stable and able to handle all WordPress queries properly,\u201d Stathopoulos said. \u201cThe SQL Lexer is part of the\u00a0PHPMyAdmin/SQL-Parser\u00a0project (licensed under the\u00a0GPL\u00a02.0) and it was adapted for WordPress, effectively implementing a\u00a0MySQL to SQLite translation engine. This provides improved security, as well as compatibility.\u201d\nStathopoulos contends that the next step is to implement these changes in WordPress core \u201cinstead of using a plugin,\u201d because in its current form it can only be tested on pre-existing websites that already have a MySQL database.\n\u201cUsing the\u00a0featured\u00a0plugin is a great way to allow users to test the implementation and iron out any issues etc,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, long-term, it doesn\u2019t make sense to use it as a plugin.\u201d\u00a0\nStathopoulos created a draft Pull Request\u00a0and an accompanying\u00a0Trac ticket proposing the new implementation be merged into core.\nAlthough the effort has received positive feedback and support from the community and WordPress lead developer Matt Mullenweg, the feature plugin has only 30 active installs and the new implementation has received very little testing.\nMultiple participants in the discussion, including core committer Aaron Jorbin and lead developer Andrew Ozz, expressed concerns about the proposal\u2019s call for merging the changes to core as the next step. \n\u201cTalk of merging to\u00a0core\u00a0feels incredibly premature for a couple of reasons,\u201d Jorbin said. \u201cThe\u00a0plugin\u00a0now only has around 30 installations. I think there needs to be much higher adoption in order to understand how the near-infinite number of plugins will work with this deep underlying change to WordPress.\u201d\nJorbin also referenced WordPress\u2019 philosophy of building things for end users who don\u2019t want to have to make decisions about the underlying tech but simply want things to work.\n\u201cAssuming that a user is going to understand different database engines and the potential tradeoffs feels far stretched to me,\u201d Jorbin said. \u201cTherefore, any implementation really needs to be rock solid and extremely thoroughly tested.\u201d\nJorbin also echoed concerns of other contributors in previous conversations, about SQLite\u2019s bizarre religion-infused \u201ccode of ethics.\u201d\nOzz suggested the plugin could be added to WordPress as a mu-plugin or a \u201cdrop-in\u201d similar to how caching add-ons are implemented, pushing back on the rigidity of the requirement to fully merge it into core.\n\u201cBoth of these methods are also better/more suitable for the users as they can be done by the hosting company or the script used for WordPress installation,\u201d Ozz said. \u201cThere are some other benefits like independent updates, etc.\u201d\nStathopoulos responded to these concerns, saying that he sees the merge to core as a long-term goal, although the proposal communicated more of an urgency that confused participants in the discussion.\n\u201cIt is premature,\u201d Stathopoulos admitted. \u201cHowever, looking at the bigger picture, it is not premature to plan for the future and get ready for it.\n\u201cIt may be premature now, but it won\u2019t be 2 years from now\u2026 The problem is that we won\u2019t be able to do it in the future unless we start working on it now.SQLite is not something that can \u2013 or should \u2013 happen in Core now, or even a year from now. It\u2019s a long-term goal, and should be treated as such.\u201d\nStathopoulos agreed that the plugin needs more adoption to see how it works with plugins across the ecosystem. He also responded to concerns about users not fully understanding the implications of the database engine they select on installation.\n\u201cThe proof-of-concept\u00a0UI\u00a0I put in place in the Core PR is just that \u2013 a proof of concept,\u201d  Stathopoulos said. \u201cSomething to trigger discussion and allow us to find solutions. It can be anything, even installation scenarios (do you want to create a\u00a0blog? A small e-commerce site? A large news outlet? The next Amazon?) That is a discussion that will need to happen when the time is right to discuss UI, but it\u2019s is a bit too early for that, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet.\u201d\nStathopoulos recommends contributors test the new implementation with all the plugins they normally use, via the SQLite Database Integration plugin or by testing the\u00a0draft pull request in WordPress Core.\nCategory: News, PluginsShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Like thisLike Loading\u2026\n\n3\n\n\n\n\t\t3 responses to \u201cNewly Rewritten WordPress SQLite Database Integration Plugin Needs Testing\u201d\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sean Peckman says: \n\nApril 22, 2023 at 1:28 PM \n\n\nI\u2019d there really any point in this?
