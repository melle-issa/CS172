Masking is still required in healthcare facilities.\u00a0\nDear Stanford community,\u00a0\nAs our community reassembles for winter quarter following holiday travel and gatherings all over the globe, we need to continue taking steps to guard against widespread transmission of coronavirus, influenza, and RSV.\u00a0\nTherefore, the Stanford Public Health Steering Committee strongly recommends wearing masks in classrooms and instructional spaces during the remainder of January. This is a strong general recommendation, but individual instructors also have autonomy to require masks in their classrooms and will post expectations on Canvas, as needed.\nFaculty and instructors can reach out to their home departments to inquire about ordering classroom masking supplies. All Stanford faculty, staff, postdocs, and students can pick up masks for individual use at Arrillaga Family Dining Commons and Environmental Health & Safety testing sites, during their open hours.\nStanford also strongly recommends masking indoors and in crowded outdoor settings. Masking is still required in healthcare facilities, including Vaden Health Center and Stanford Hospitals and Clinics, compliant with the California Department of Public Health guidance.\nPlease continue taking these steps and other precautions to protect you and those around you.\nSincerely,\nDr. James JacobsChair, Stanford University Public Health Steering CommitteeExecutive Director, Vaden Health Services\n\n\nPrevious postStaying healthy over winter break\nNext postChanges to COVID\u00a0testing program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford\n\n \nCOVID-19\nHealth Alerts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Health Resources\n\nSchool of Medicine COVID-19 Updates\nStudent Affairs Guidance for Students\nVaden Health Center (for students)\nSU Occupational Health Center (for employees)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther COVID-19 resources\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nU.S. Food & Drug Administration\nSanta Clara County Public Health\nSan Mateo County Health\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\nFor questions related to Stanford's response to COVID-19 or other health concerns, please fill out this EH&S Health Guidance form.\nFor feedback about this website, please email digital-strategy@stanford.edu.\n\n\n\nConnect with us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanfordUniversity\n\n\n\n\nStanford Home(link is external)\n\nMaps & Directions(link is external)\n\nSearch Stanford(link is external)\n\nEmergency Info(link is external)\n\n\n\nTerms of Use(link is external)\n\nPrivacy(link is external)\n\nCopyright(link is external)\n\nTrademarks(link is external)\n\nNon-Discrimination(link is external)\n\nAccessibility(link is external)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University.\n\u00a0 Stanford, California 94305.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
