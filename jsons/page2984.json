I know, for me, being able to escape for a few moments here and there during the past week (thanks to Dimitri Keriotis and his collection of stories in The Quiet Time) I have been able to get out of my head, go to other places and be \u201caway from it all\u201d\u2014have a little \u201cquiet time\u201d of my own. I have been fortunate. Unfortunately for the characters within the book, they don\u2019t find themselves in such relaxing situations. They seem to be precisely entrenched in key moments where they must pause and take a drastic turn. Each short story in The Quiet Time is unique, different from the others, yet they all share this same, powerful similarity.\nMost of the time, I didn\u2019t necessarily like these characters or the positions they put themselves in, but I loved reading about where they would wind up. I loved getting to know them and what made them tick. I loved escaping into their self-made worlds of drama. Each complex character seemed to be searching, wanting to get it right or understand, but couldn\u2019t quite get there. And if they did, their eventual decision made me cringe\u2014but even at that, I couldn\u2019t help but smile.\nI was excited to discover some other things Dimitri Keriotis and I have in common. Keriotis teaches at Modesto Junior College and I grew up in Oakdale where MJC was my Junior College growing up. He is originally from Yuba City and I currently live in Yuba City. We both have worked with Paul Eggers and Rob Davidson here at Chico State as graduate students\u2014he earned an MFA here and I am about to finish my MA. I am sure I am not alone in feeling truly pleased to have him present to us so we can applaud his writing, specifically his debut book The Quiet Time.\nMore about Dimitri Keriotis and his work can be found on his website. Also, take time to read more about his current projects, including the High Sierra Institute, which he co-founded and co-coordinates. Information, like the following, can be found there: The Quiet Time consists of eleven stories. Some of the pieces take place in foreign countries\u2014Zaire (Congo) and Greece\u2014and center on interactions between a host nation and an American visitor. Others, mainly set in the US, focus on human relationships. The Quiet Time was released by SFA Press. Keriotis\u2019s stories have appeared or are forthcoming in Beloit Fiction Journal, Georgetown Review, Evening Street Review, Flyway, BorderSenses, and elsewhere. Raised in Northern California, he was educated at UC Santa Cruz, University of Nevada, Reno, and CSU Chico and served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Zaire and Bolivia. He and his family live in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada.\nI\u2019m looking forward to hearing what Dimitri has to share with us and know you will all be \u201ctaken away\u201d as well. Please join us for an exciting evening with him, Thursday, April 30th at 7:30 pm in Colusa 100B. Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, Writer\u2019s Voice readings are free and open to the public.\nBy Tomie Bitton\n\n \n\nApril 27, 2015watershedcsuc\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll\n\nDiscuss\nGet Inspired\nGet Polling\nGet Support\nLearn WordPress.com\nTheme Showcase\nWordPress Planet\nWordPress.com News\n\n\nTopics\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nUpcoming Events No upcoming events\nArchives\n\nMay 2022\nMarch 2022\nMay 2020\nOctober 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nOctober 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nApril 2017\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nDecember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nApril 2014\nFebruary 2014\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nAugust 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\n\n \n\nFollow me on TwitterMy Tweets \n\n\n\n\nCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
