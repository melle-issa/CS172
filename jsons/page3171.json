(\u00a0EM 05-17\u00a0)More information on the University Budget Committee can be found on the\u00a0\u00a0Academic Senate's(opens in new window)(opens in new window)\u00a0webpage or by clicking the links below:Agendas & Minutes(opens in new window)Meeting Schedule(opens in new window)Committee Members(opens in new window)Campus Department Organization ProcessPurposeCampus organizational data is housed in three separate systems of authority. In order for various reports to leverage this organizational data and return consistent results, the three systems must all be kept in sync. This is accomplished via one of the two tickets linked below which allow a user to generate a single ticket requesting a new action and this ticket informs the SMEs for the various systems of authority to all make the necessary update(s).These two ticket types or for either the creation of a new department or modification to an existing department.ORG \u2013 New Department(opens in new window)ORG \u2013 Change or Update to Existing Department(opens in new window)For information needed to submit one of the above tickets please refer to the Organizational Department IT Ticket Guide (PDF).\u00a0This business process guide (BPG) reflects the new definitions, rules, and processes that are used to manage organizational data.Department Definitions:Official Campus Department:\u00a0A business unit that is formally organized and/or separately budgeted. To be considered an Official Campus Department, a department must submit a request specifying the activity and the organizational need to distinguish it from other departments.Campus Group:(Primarily used in Directory):\u00a0A group that is organized for purposes of performing a function and/or for contact/communications purposes, but which does not meet the same formal criteria or follow the same formal data management processes as Official Campus Departments (i.e., these are \u201cunofficial\u201d groups). A Campus Group must always roll up to a parent Official Campus Department (i.e., a Campus Group cannot roll up to another Campus Group).Department Data Elements:DeptID: The shortcode that uniquely identifies the department (Ex. D08600)Short Description: The acronym that uniquely identifies the department. This alpha-only acronym (letters only; no numbers or other characters) must be 2-4 characters in length (Ex. ECC)Description: A 30-character max length name of the department (Ex. Coll Of Engnr Comp Sci&Cnst Mg)Long Description: The fully qualified name of the department is limited to 70 characters max (Ex. College of Engineering, Computer Science, & Construction Management)Decisions and Sources of Authority:Three IT systems together are considered the collective \u201csource of authority\u201d for Organizational Data for Official Campus Departments are:PeopleSoft Finance, Finance TreePeopleSoft HR, HR TreePeopleSoft Campus Solutions, Academic Org Tree (only for Academic Departments)*Which to use for decision-making is dependent on the situation.Department TreesTrees are the method used for organizing structural data and utilize \u201cbranches\u201d or \u201clevels\u201d to accomplish this. The campus structure is as follows:Level 1 \u2013 CampusLevel 2 \u2013 Division (Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, etc.)Level 3 \u2013 Major Budget Unit (MBU) or College (College of Natural Sciences, Financial Services, etc.)Level 4 \u2013 Department (IT Support Services, University Communications, etc.)Which tree to use for reporting purposes can be dependent on the use case and it is recommended that before a particular tree is selected for use in a report that the Org Tree Working Group be consulted to provide feedback on the most appropriate tree.General Org Data RecommendationsWhenever possible, data should be pulled from one of the above three systems of authority rather than another downstream system. E.g. a person\u2019s department information should come from their position data in HR rather than directory.OpenBook Transparency PortalIn an effort to provide a more inclusive and transparent budget, CSU, Chico is pleased to present our Financial Transparency Portal. \u00a0CSU, Chico has partnered with OpenBook(opens in new window) to provide a web-based financial transparency and business intelligence tool that dynamically presents the University's multi-fund basis revenues and expenses. \u00a0Division of Business & FinanceVice President for Business & FinanceZip Code:\u00a095929-0025www.csuchico.edu/vpbfDepartmentsAudit ServicesDistribution ServicesEnvironmental Health and SafetyFacilities Management and ServicesFinancial ServicesHuman Resources Service CenterProcurement & Contract ServicesRisk ManagementStaff CouncilUniversity Budget OfficeUniversity Police\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.Contact UsNeed Help?FacebookFacebookTwitterTwitterInstagramInstagramReport an accessibility issueReport a broken link on this pageTitle IXPrivacy PolicyCalifornia State University, Chico400 West First StreetChico, CA 95929Copyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n",
