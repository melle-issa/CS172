The company\u2019s 450+ customers include GoDaddy, IONOS, InMotion hosting, and other hosts.\nVirtuozzo\u2019s WordPress platform  enables service providers to sell containerized hosting as a service. The most recent update introduces a new user interface designed for WordPress customers that makes it easy to configure resources, adjust scaling, pay invoices, and deploy WordPress websites.\n\nVersion 2.0 of the Virtuozzo Application Platform for WordPress includes automatic scaling up or down in response to traffic spikes, the ability to offer consumption-based pricing, automated WordPress deployment for single instances to multi-region clusters, and efficient hardware utilization with fully isolated containers and automatic failover. \nThe new platform makes it possible for any hosting provider to offer some of the same features that more expensive managed hosts provide. Virtuozzo pioneered the platform with AzPocket, a Japanese WordPress host, as the first adopter, who used it to expand the features of its shared hosting offerings.\n\u201cThere is a significant gap in the WordPress hosting market, between cheap shared or VPS hosting services, and more expensive managed WordPress from companies such as WP Engine and Kinsta,\u201d Virtuozzo VP of Strategic Product Development Carlos Rego said. \u201cOur solution enables any service provider to offer modern, containerized WordPress-as-a-Service at a fraction of the cost of those \u2018premium\u2019 providers.\u201d\u00a0\nVirtuozzo will be hosting a webinar on how to sell premium WordPress hosting\u00a0on May 4, 2023, at 11AM EDT/ 5PM CET. Planned topics include the opportunity for hosting in the WordPress market, the drawbacks of current hosting products, and how to create a \u201cWordPress as a Service business in a box.\u201d Virtuozzo representatives will demo the new WordPress platform and answer questions from attendees at the conclusion of the event.\nCategory: NewsTags: VirtuozzoShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Like thisLike Loading\u2026\n\n1\n\n\n\n\t\tOne response to \u201cVirtuozzo Launches Version 2.0 of Its Application Platform for WordPress\u201d\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Neo says: \n\nApril 24, 2023 at 1:12 AM \n\n\nVery good solution for WP Hosting Business.\nAnyway, I contacted for more details & pricing but too long for response.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
