Photo by Lee Choo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduation is a time of joy and pride. At CSUN, the happiness is palpable across campus. So many students have made sacrifices to complete their degrees\u00a0\u2014\u00a0working multiple jobs, taking out loans and giving up time with friends and family for the promise of higher education.\n\n\nFor nine Matador graduates this year, crossing the commencement stage was a particular triumph.\n\n\nThese members of the Class of 2022 \u2014 all women \u2014 made up the university\u2019s second cohort of Project Rebound. The program, which launched at CSUN in 2020, was created at San Francisco State University in 1967 to guide formerly incarcerated people through higher education.\n\n\nSeven Project Rebound graduates shared their stories with us. Many graduated with honors this spring, and five earned master\u2019s degrees. Some have served years in state or federal prisons. Others spent time in county jail. Some grew up in families where addiction, not college, was the norm. One is a former foster youth who, as a teen, tried to hold her family together after the death of her guardian.\n\n\nTheir stories may differ, but each shares a common thread of struggle, whether emotional or financial.\n\n\nThe graduates also share an unwavering desire to give back, through their chosen career path or as volunteers tutoring, counseling or listening to others.\n\n\nTheir time in college ignited the fire of determination and the will to succeed in each of them, even when facing uncertain housing, parenting responsibilities and financial difficulties.\n\n\nThe Project Rebound graduates\u2019 love and appreciation for education is evident. They have learned, the hard way, how education can lift them up \u2014 and they are ready to keep climbing.\n\n\nDespite their accomplishments, many still feel self-doubt and shame. They worry about being accepted at work and in the community. Those who have had their criminal records expunged still worry that their past mistakes will prevent them from doing meaningful work in the future.\n\n\nProject Rebound offered this cohort a safety net, financial support and, most importantly, a community of others, like family, who have traveled the same road.\n\n\nHere are some of their stories.\n\n\nThe Graduates\u00a0\n\n\nKathy Jamieson\u00a0(M.S.W, Social Work, College of Social and Behavioral Sciences)\nKathy Jamieson, M.S.W., Social Work. Photo by Lee Choo.\n\n\nThis spring, Kathy Jamieson completed her master\u2019s in social work, graduating with honors. She plans to pursue certification as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. Jamieson is the first in her family to get a college degree.\n\n\nFor the self-described \u201cnon-traditional student,\u201d it\u2019s been a long road to that degree. Jamieson, 52, was first incarcerated at age 33, then again at 37. Alcohol and drug addiction led her to poor choices, she said. \u201cI know what opiates can do,\u201d Jamieson said. \u201cI know how they ravage families.\u201d\n\n\nShe credits her first steps toward higher education to the staff at the treatment center where she went through detox. Later, the staff hired her as a psychiatric technician. Encouraged to consider a career in that profession by the treatment center staff, Jamieson\u00a0enrolled at Pierce College.\n\n\n\u201cI was very scared walking on that campus my first day,\u201d she said. \u201cMy legs shook.\u201d Jamieson didn\u2019t tell anyone about her past in her general education classes. \u201cThere was so much shame and so much guilt,\u201d she said.\nAfter transferring to CSUN and completing her bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology (magna cum laude), Jamieson applied to CSUN\u2019s Master of Social Work program, where confidence and truth slowly overtook her shame and guilt.\n\n\n\u201cThe professors in the M.S.W. program, once I disclosed my past in class \u2026 I just felt understood,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just been something super special about this program. And then came Project Rebound.\u201d\n\n\nLike other graduates in the program, Jamieson credited the emotional support provided by the Project Rebound community with helping her get through graduate school. \u201cDr. [Martha] Escobar is creating a community for people to feel like they belong,\u201d she said.\n\n\nSome of her feelings of guilt and shame linger, but they\u2019re fading, Jamieson said. \u201cThere is a view of what a person with a criminal history looks like or a drug addict looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to change that face.\u201d\n\n\nDellaynnah Cleveland\u00a0(M.S.W, Social Work, College of Social and Behavioral Sciences)\nDellaynnah Cleveland, M.S.W., Social Work. Photo by Lee Choo.\n\n\nDellaynnah Cleveland wants to start her own nonprofit someday, working with the homeless population. A single parent of a 7-year-old daughter, Cleveland worked full time while pursuing her master\u2019s degree and maintained, as she put it, \u201cpretty much straight-A\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough being a single parent, trying to get an education and model something for them,\u201d Cleveland said.\n\n\nCleveland was incarcerated at the age of 19, for 3-and-a-half years, after growing up, in part, in foster care. While in prison, she earned her associate degree in business, through a correspondence course. It was there she realized an education was necessary because her criminal background would limit her opportunities.\n\u201cI knew that I would need to obtain an education in order to combat the ills of society and to increase my odds of having and living a \u2018normal\u2019 productive life,\u201d she said. After she was released, she enrolled in social and behavioral sciences courses at CSU Bakersfield, where she completed her bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology with a minor in psychology.\n\n\nAlways interested in higher education, Cleveland had maintained at least a 3.5 GPA in high school. But her path forward was full of disruptions and tragedy. She left foster care to live with an aunt, who died in a car accident when she was 17 years old. She was determined to stay with her younger cousins.\n\n\n\u201cSo here we are, 17, 16 and 15, trying to figure out how to survive and not get pulled into the [foster care] system again,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that is what opened doors to petty crimes, that turned into me being incarcerated.\u201d It was about survival, Cleveland said, \u201cbut the system doesn\u2019t look at the things that you go through that get you here, the trials that you face.\u201d\n\n\nProject Rebound\u2019s focus on formerly incarcerated students is critical, she said.\n\n\n\u201cMost people come [to higher education] already believing they don\u2019t have what it takes to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cTo have an organization who believes in your ability to access higher education is needed \u2014 to lift up those people who are actually trying to make a difference and trying to fit into society the best way that they can.\u201d\n\n\nAna Zapata\u00a0(B.A., Sociology, College of Social and Behavioral Sciences).\nAna Zapata, B.A., Sociology. Photo by Lee Choo.\nAna Zapata started taking college courses at Mission College when she was in high school.\n\u201cI always knew I wanted to go to college,\u201d Zapata said. She started with a child development class, and then took another class during her senior year of high school. \u201cThen I got into some trouble,\u201d she said, \u201cand I had to stop taking that class.\u201d\n\n\nZapata and her mother had a heated argument after Zapata\u2019s class was cancelled for the day.\u00a0 Her mother thought she was cutting school. The police were called. Many members of Zapata\u2019s family are undocumented immigrants from Mexico, and she worries about family members getting arrested. \u201cI\u2019m very overprotective of my family,\u201d she said. \u201cI never want anything bad to happen to them.\u201d\n\n\nAfter that run-in with the police, Zapata said she spent time recovering in a mental health facility. Later, in her 20s, further problems with the law led to Zapata serving a stint in county jail. Since then, she has become a U.S. citizen and now, a college graduate, the first in her family. The 34-year-old is considering pursuing a master\u2019s degree in social work or library science.\n\n\n\u00a0Whatever career path she follows, Zapata said, she wants to help people.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot, and I just wanna make sure that the next person who is in need of help at least has guidance,\u201d she said. She credited Project Rebound with spurring her interest in graduate school. \u201cI noticed, once I joined them, I got more motivated,\u201d Zapata said.\n\n\nShannon Tinker\u00a0(M.S.W., Social Work, College of Social and Behavioral Sciences)\nShannon Tinker, M.S.W., Social Work. Photo by Lee Choo.\n\n\nShannon Tinker has spent the past eight years pursuing higher education. With her newly completed master\u2019s degree in social work, she wants to work as a mental health and substance abuse clinician. Part of her studies have included internships in counseling.\n\n\n\u201cMy life has completely changed,\u201d she said. \u201cI help a lot of clients who have mental health and substance abuse issues and legal issues, so I feel like I\u2019m giving back what was given to me.\u201d\n\n\nYears ago, Tinker\u2019s behavior due to her addiction led to criminal charges. She spent a brief time in county jail, then went through recovery programs that allowed her to have her criminal record expunged.\n\n\nTinker is the first in her family to graduate from college. Despite how far she\u2019s come, she still feels doubt and worries that her past will limit her future endeavors.\n\n\n\u201cI have a lot of hope, but those questions always play in the back of your head, because there\u2019s a limit to what someone can do when they\u2019ve been arrested and had a felony,\u201d Tinker said.\n\n\nThe support she\u2019s received from Project Rebound was much more than financial, she said. \u201cThe financial resources have been really helpful, but they also assign you to a social worker who checks in with your needs,\u201d Tinker said. \u201cYou just have this little community that\u2019s uniquely working with you and providing any kind of help you need.\u201d\n\n\nHer joy at graduation has been shadowed by loss, however. While completing her last semester at CSUN, Tinker\u2019s older brother died. She struggled with grief while finishing her thesis, and she said her Project Rebound support system helped her get to the finish line. On graduation day, Tinker honored her brother\u2019s memory by decorating her sash and mortar board with his name.\n\n\nMaygin McEwen\u00a0(M.S.W, Social Work, College of Social and Behavioral Sciences).\nMaygin McEwen, M.S.W., Social Work. Photo by Lee Choo.\n\n\nMaygin McEwen is graduating with a master\u2019s degree in social work, after completing her bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology at CSUN in 2019. Still weighing her career path options, McEwen is considering working toward certification as a licensed clinical social worker. She also enjoys lobbying and working on behalf of human rights and social justice. She has participated in lobby days with the National Association of Social Workers and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\nProject Rebound has offered McEwen help with some basic needs, but there\u2019s much more to the program, she said.\n\n\n\u201cCommunity is such a big thing, you know?\u201d she said. \u201cMartha [Escobar] and Lily [Gonzalez] are just there [for us],\u201d McEwen said of the program\u2019s directors. She\u2019s now an intern for Project Rebound, working with Gonzalez, corresponding with incarcerated people about to be released and helping them plan their education.\n\n\nMcEwen, 55, completed all of her college coursework after stints in state and federal prisons. \u201cI\u2019ve worked hard for this,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it also gives me the ability [to say to] somebody who\u2019s gotten out, \u2018You can\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t do it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\nMaria Martinez\u00a0(B.S., Computer Science, College of Engineering and Computer Science).\nMaria Martinez. B.S. Computer Science. Photo by Lee Choo.\nAfter a year-long internship as a software engineer with the Walt Disney Company, Maria Martinez has lined up a full-time job with the entertainment giant, complete with a six-figure salary. They credited their success in difficult computer science courses, in part, to a hobby they learned in prison.\n\n\n\u201cThe classes were really hard until it clicked, and I was like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s like crocheting!\u2019\u201d Martinez said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new language and it\u2019s a pattern, and the logic behind it.\u201d Martinez learned to crochet while in prison, to de-stress.\n\n\nTheir younger sister, Denise, encouraged them to get their degree in computer science, Martinez said. Shortly before they were paroled from Folsom Women\u2019s Facility, Denise came for a visit and asked about their career plans. \u201cI told her, \u2018[I\u2019ll] probably just go and be a hairdresser or something,\u2019\u201d Martinez said.\n\n\nBut Denise had other plans. A software engineer for a gaming company, Denise enrolled Maria at East Los Angeles Community College, even before they\u2019d been released from prison. The classes were hard, and Martinez struggled with imposter syndrome. After they transferred to CSUN, they drew strength from the Project Rebound community, Martinez said\n\n\n\u201cSeeing other individuals graduating with similar backgrounds, I was like, \u2018OK, I can do this. They can do it \u2014 I can do it,\u2019\u201d they said.\n\n\nWhile working and pursuing their degree at CSUN, Martinez has also tutored others in computer science and coding. Another point of pride: They convinced Disney management to create an internship for formerly incarcerated people studying computer science.\n\n\nAlexandra Reyes, M.A. Diverse Community Development Leadership. Photo by Lee Choo.\nAlexandra Reyes\u00a0(M.A., Diverse Community Development Leadership, Tseng College, Graduate, International and Midcareer Education)\n\n\nAlexandra Reyes has earned her master\u2019s degree in diverse community development leadership. She works as a paralegal \u2014 a job she landed through an internship, while studying sociology as an undergraduate at CSUN. But it\u2019s been a difficult journey. Reyes dealt with homelessness as a teen and got into trouble with the law around the same time. After having her son, she knew she needed to pursue higher education for better opportunities, she said.\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cThe doors started closing. When I was trying to look for work, simple work, everyone was just denying me,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a new mother, you just feel like a failure. How can I not provide for this child?\u201d\n\n\nAt CSUN, her undergraduate courses sparked a passion for social justice work, Reyes said. Then, an email from CSUN about the new master\u2019s program for diverse community development leadership attracted her.\nOn this journey, the support from Project Rebound was important, she said. \u201cProject Rebound is amazing,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cThey were able to help me with food, to give my kids food.\u201d\n\n\nReyes, 33, enjoys her work as a paralegal and wants to focus more on securing grants for the non-profit where she works, Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County. She is considering going to law school. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my higher education, I don\u2019t know where I\u2019d be,\u201d she said.\n\n\nThe Founders\u00a0\n\n\nLily Gonzalez\u00a0(B.A. Chicana/o Studies, 2017. College of Humanities) and\u00a0Martha Escobar,\u00a0Ph.D.\nLily Gonzalez and Martha Escobar, Ph.D. Photo by Lee Choo.\n\n\nLily Gonzalez and Martha Escobar are the driving forces behind Project Rebound at CSUN. Gonzalez, Project Rebound\u2019s program coordinator, is\u00a0 a CSUN student, pursuing a master\u2019s degree in Chicana/o Studies and formerly incarcerated.\nIn 2015-2016, she started Revolutionary Scholars, a group on campus that also supported formerly incarcerated students and lobbied to bring Project Rebound to CSUN.\n\n\n\u201cRevolutionary Scholars allowed us to do a lot of the work that was needed to bring Project Rebound to campus,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cIt was a collective effort.\u201d\nGonzalez corresponds with incarcerated people who are about to be paroled and works with them to determine their best path to continue their education.\n\n\nEscobar is a professor of Chicana/o studies in the College of Humanities. She is the executive director of CSUN\u2019s Project Rebound but is quick to say that it is a part-time position. However, her presence and dedication to the program is praised by the students, who said they receive emails from her starting at 4:30 in the morning. \u201cWhat can I say? It\u2019s when I have some time!\u201d Escobar said.\n\n\nParticipating students sign an agreement to be part of the Project Rebound program and receive state funding for food and transportation, and books, Escobar said. The group also fundraises to help with emergencies.\nEscobar said she worries about those who have signed up with the program but are not in close contact with members. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what their struggles are, you know?\u201d She said.\nAs for the success of the program, Escobar says it\u2019s not just that a degree opens opportunities. \u201cIt\u2019s that you change the way that you think about the world and about yourself. It\u2019s very much grounded in social justice.\u201d\n\n\nProject Rebound has more than 30 students enrolled. Its organizers are also communicating with about 150 incarcerated people who want to continue their education once they are paroled.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Alumni, College of Engineering and Computer Science, College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, Community, CSUN, Events, Students\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n\n\n\nCSUN Success Story: How Malachia Hoover\u2019s Time as a Matador Put Her on the Path to Saving Lives\n\n\nStudying Away \u2013 Get to Know the International and Exchange Student Center\n\n\nNew Tech and a Sense of Community: CSUN\u2019s Assistive Technology Conference Celebrates 38 Years\n\n\nCSUN to host multimedia performance that explores climate change\n\n\n\u2018Ghosts\u2019 Stories: On a Hit TV Show, CSUN Alum Uses His Voice\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u2190 Return of the Movie Fest \u2013 Summer Movie Nights Return to CSUN Campus\nCSUN Prof to Spend Next Year Studying Mexico\u2019s Indigenous Social Networks as a Ford Postdoc Fellow \u2192\n\n\n\n\nTopicsArts and Culture\nAthletics\nBusiness\nCommunity\nEducation\nFaculty and Staff News\n\nFaculty and Staff Achievements\n\nHonors & Awards\nPresentations\nPublications\nResearch and Sponsored Projects\n\n\n\n\nHealth and Fitness\nMedia Releases\nPolitics and Society\nScience and Technology\n@CSUN Archive\nCSU News\n Unknown Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the full  experience\n\nSubscribe Today\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe:\nRSS\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia State University, Northridge\nUniversity Advancement\nMarketing and Communications\n\t\t\t\t\t18111 Nordhoff Street, Northridge, CA 91330\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone: (818) 677-2130 / Contact Us\n\n\nContact Page Owner\nUniversity Policies\nAcrobat Reader\n\n\nCalifornia State University\nEmergency Information\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
