Physics Prof Joins Research Projects on Groundbreaking Telescope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten By\n\t\tGabby Ferreira\n\n\nJuly 8, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn late December, an important piece of scientific equipment blasted into space to embark on research that could change how we see the universe.\u00a0\nThis image, taken by the James Webb Space Telescope in March to evaluate mirror alignment, centers on a star called 2MASS J17554042+6551277. Other stars and galaxies can be seen in the background.\u00a0NASA/STScIThe James Webb Space Telescope, successor to the iconic Hubble Telescope that went into space in 1990, is a big deal: it\u2019s an orbiting infrared observatory, meaning it has longer wavelength coverage and improved sensitivity that enables the telescope to look much closer to the beginning of time as well as to look inside dust clouds where stars and planetary systems are forming.\nAnd there\u2019s a Cal Poly connection to this history-making moment: physics Professor Vardha Bennert is involved in two research projects aboard the telescope. Bennert, who primarily studies active galactic nuclei and supermassive black holes, will use her expertise to advise researchers studying dark matter and the rate of expansion of the universe.\nAn active galactic nucleus, or AGN, is the center of a galaxy.\nAn image of NGC 1448, a galaxy with an active galactic nucleus, that was taken in 2017.\u00a0Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey/NASA/JPL-CaltechScientists theorize that at the center of almost every galaxy is a supermassive black hole. If gas and dust accumulate around the black hole, they form a disk (called an accretion disk) that rotates around it.\n\u201cEven though black holes themselves don\u2019t emit light, the accretion disks around them do, and then they become active galactic nuclei,\u201d Bennert said. \u201cThese accretion disks can be as bright as an entire galaxy.\u201d\nBecause the AGNs are so bright, scientists can use them as reference points to study cosmology, the study of the origins and development of the universe.\nOne of the research teams Bennert is involved in will use the dusty torus \u2014 the ring of dust that surrounds the smaller accretion disk \u2014 to probe small chunks of dark matter. The dusty torus only emits light in the infrared wavelength, which is why using the James Webb Space Telescope is so important to the research.\n\u201cWhat we know of the universe \u2014 what you and I are made of, what stars and galaxies and ordinary matter are made of, is only 5% of the universe,\u201d Bennert said.\nScientists estimate that roughly 27% of the unknown universe is dark matter, so called because it doesn\u2019t emit nor interact with light. Because it has mass, the only way scientists can detect it is through its interaction with gravity.\n\u201cBefore the James Webb Space Telescope, we couldn\u2019t have done this,\u201d Bennert said.\nProfessor Vardha Bennert.The other project Bennert is part of, headed by Tommaso Treu of UCLA, will also use active galactic nuclei, this time to measure the Hubble constant, which expresses the expansion rate of the universe.\nThe expansion rate is important because it can be extrapolated backward to learn when the Big Bang happened and find out the age of the universe. Scientists have already measured the universe\u2019s expansion rate, but there are significant discrepancies in the different measurements. The team Bennert\u2019s advising,\u00a0which she became involved with after the research proposal was submitted, is hoping to understand why there are discrepancies and get a more accurate Hubble constant scientists can work with.\nGetting research time on the James Webb Space Telescope was no small feat: Anna Nierenberg, assistant professor at UC Merced and the lead investigator on the dark matter project, submitted the proposal and it went through a highly selective peer-reviewed process to get approved.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard, it\u2019s really competitive to get time, so you have to have a really good idea and you have to argue it really well,\u201d Bennert said. \u201cYou need to argue why you need to do it with this telescope and why you can\u2019t do it with any other telescope.\u201d\nIn May, Bennert said the dark matter team\u2019s first observation was scheduled and will occur between October and December 2022.\nArianespace's Ariane 5 rocket launches with NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope onboard on December 25, 2021. NASA/Chris Gunn\u201cThis particular proposal has 16 investigators from around the world, from 10 different institutions, from 4 different countries,\u201d Bennert said. \u201cIt's a team effort and I'm just a smaller one of those players. I\u2019m really grateful to be involved and inspire my students with that as well.\nCosmology research is a totally new area for me, and both of these teams are doing cutting-edge research into the most important questions in cosmology: what is dark matter and what is the expansion rate of our universe,\u201d she continued, adding that though she can\u2019t predict what will happen, she expects many new discoveries with the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an exciting time to be an astronomer right now.\u201d\nEditor's note: The header image of the James Webb Space Telescope was captured by the cameras onboard the Ariane 5 rocket as the telescope separated from it following the launch in December. It is humanity's last look at the telescope as it heads to deep space. Image credit: Arianespace, ESA, NASA, CSA, CNES\n\u00a0\nWant more Learn by Doing stories in your life?
