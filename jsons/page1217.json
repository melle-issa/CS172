(Continuing Seawolves from Fall 2022 or Spring 2023 will follow the Continuing SSU Student Application Process).\nApplications for the 2023/2024 academic year open on February 1 for incoming freshmen, transfer, and graduate students. Applications for Spring 2024 only admitted freshmen, transfer, and graduate students open on October 1.\u00a0 Apply early for the best chance of getting your preferred room type and location.\nWhen you apply, you will make a $300 Housing Down Payment.\u00a0 The $300 will be applied to your fall semester\u00a0rent charges. (Students who have a financial hardship should contact the REACH Office for alternative payment options)\nIncoming freshmen, transfer, and graduate students must complete their intent to enroll in order to receive a room assignment.\nRoom assignments are NOT GUARANTEED.\u00a0 Priority is determined by the date you apply to live on campus.\nPlease note housing applications are accepted until capacity is reached. In the event that we reach capacity, we will continue to accept applications and payments. Students will be placed on a waitlist. In the event that we are unable to house you one week after the semester begins, we will refund the payment in full.\nBefore you begin...\nWhen you apply to live on campus, you will be submitting a preference for living community and room type (based on the community).\u00a0 We encourage students to research their options ahead of time:\nIs there a Living Learning Community that interests you?\nWhile not required, we encourage students to join a living learning community to get connected in their first year. (note LLCs are connected to specific villages/room types)\nWhat room type fits your budget?\nTake a look at our On Campus Rates & Installments.\u00a0 It is important to know the cost of where you are going to live and what is affordable\nWhat room type are you looking for?\nDo you prefer\u00a0a single, double or triple occupancy room? For incoming first-year first-time freshmen, do you prefer suite style or apartment style living area?\u00a0 Check out the Housing Options. (some room types are limited)\nApply for Housing...\nBe admitted for Fall 2023\u00a0or Spring 2024.\nLog into the Housing Portal (you will need your SSU username and password) and click on \"Apply 2023/2024.\"\nMake the $300 Housing Down Payment.\n\tFinancial Hardship? Please email our office for an alternative payment option\nAdmitted EOP students will make a one-time $100 payment and defer the remaining balance to their first\u00a0Installment.\n\nComplete your profile information and agree to the terms and conditions of the student housing license agreement.\nSelect your preferred Living Community and rank your room type\n\tMake sure you reviewed the Housing Options and On Campus Rates & Installments\u00a0as some Living Communities are limited to certain room types.\nFall students: You can return to this section\u00a0up until May 30 to update your preferences without it affecting your priority.\nSpring students: You can return to this section up until November 30 to update your preference without it affecting your priority.\n\nRequest a specific roommate (available May 1 - May 30). *Please contact the REACH Office for Spring only applications.\n\tRequests must be mutual (same living area and ranked room type.\u00a0 Roommates must request each other. Mismatched requests will not be processed.\nRoommate requests are viewed as a priority\u00a0over room-type requests.\u00a0 This means we will do our best to assign you with your requested roommate first, regardless of the room type preference.\n\nRoom Assignments will be emailed to the student SSU email address in mid-June for Fall students, and early December for Spring only students. *Students must have completed their intent to enroll\u00a0and paid the Housing Down Payment in full in order to receive a room assignment.\n\u00a0\n*Need to cancel? Cancellations received by June 1 for Fall applicants will receive a 50% refund of the Housing Down Payment; no refund thereafter.\u00a0Students who complete the application process and receive a room assignment from REACH will be charged a $250 fee for not providing thirty (30) day notice if they cancel after August 1 for Fall, or fail to check in seven (7) days after the start of the semester.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidential Education and Campus Housing\n\nREACH  Home\nApply for Housing\nHousing Options\nOn Campus Rates & Installments\nHousing Portal\nMove In & Move Out\nResident Services & Resources\nFire Safety Report\nEmployee Housing\nLiving Off-Campus\nParent/Guardian\nWhy Live at SSU?\nAbout REACH\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFacebook for REACH \n\n\nInstagram for REACH\n\n\nYouTube for REACH\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSU Facebook\nSSU Twitter\nSSU Instagram\nSSU Youtube\nSSU News RSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Ave\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n707.664.2880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact SSU\nPrivacy Notice\nCalifornia State University\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSafeSSU\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\nEmergency Information\nJobs\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
