undergraduate, first year, and transfer students to contact us for assistance.\u00a0\nPre-Application Appointment\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPreparing to Apply\nAs you begin thinking about college, it is important to consider a few important factors to be\u00a0admitted as a First-Year Student, such as, choosing a major, developing a good set of study skills and setting a high standard for the grades you earn.\nWith no standardized tests being utilized by the CSU for admission, students now have the opportunity to have other assets and attributes considered in the admission process including but not limited to, participation in programs or clubs available at your school or in the community\u00a0(AVID, Future Leaders, etc.)\nThis is also a critical time to begin saving for college expenses and learning about Financial Aid and Scholarships.\nTake the opportunity to do your best in the Early Assessment Program (part of the CAASPP/Smarter Balanced Assessment) in the 11th grade. It\u2019s results, along with your GPA, higher level courses during the 12th grade, affect your placement in English and math courses in College.\u00a0\nAdditional planning tools can be found at Cal State Apply.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAdmission Requirements\nFirst-Year applicants must meet the following eligibility requirements:\nA first-year applicant is a student attending\u00a0high school.\u00a0 High school students can earn college credit while enrolled at their school, however, cannot earn\u00a0college credit after the summer immediately following their high school graduation date in Spring.
