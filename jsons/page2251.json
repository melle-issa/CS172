If you\u2019ve been following along on the Ollie blog and my Twitter feed, you\u2019ve seen me sharing all kinds of fun and helpful bits about the WordPress site editor, patterns, blocks, global styles, and more.\nUnless you\u2019re experimenting with this stuff everyday, it can be hard to keep up with it and know the full scope of what\u2019s possible in WordPress with all of these new features. Heck, it\u2019s hard to keep up even if you are experimenting every day. \nIn my experience, one of the best ways of working with all of these new features and learning how they all work together is by building a WordPress block theme. And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve been doing over the past several months. \n\nIntroducing the Ollie block theme\nToday, I\u2019m excited to share with you that the Ollie WordPress block theme is officially ready to download, test, experiment with, build with, reverse engineer, and contribute to! \n\nIn this initial beta release on Github, I\u2019m hoping to gain as much feedback as possible to learn about how people use block themes. These themes introduce several new paradigms for WordPress site building, and there is a lot to be learned about how builders will use these themes and what kind of features really matter. \nAfter this brief beta testing period, the theme will be available for a free download on the official WordPress.orgWordPress.org WordPress.org is the source where you can download the software itself, which you can use to build and maintain a website on your own. repository. In the mean time, let\u2019s take a spin through some of the most powerful features of Ollie.\nLearn more about the Ollie block theme on the Ollie homepage. Check out a live demo of the Ollie block theme and download it via Github.\n\n\nView Ollie Demo\nBrowse Github\nDownload Zip\n\n\nStart building with Ollie and the Site Editor\n\nOne of the most powerful features of the Ollie block theme is that it brings together all of the new WordPress site building features in a cohesive experience. Site editor, global stylesGlobal styles Global styles is a collection of styles and settings that control the overall look and feel of your website. These settings can be adjusted with a user interface in the editor., patternsBlock patterns Block Patterns are a collection of pre-designed blocks that you can insert into pages and posts and then customize with your own content., templatesTemplates Templates are designs for pages and can include one or more template parts., template partsTemplate parts Template parts are used to organize a theme in smaller reusable structural parts. They are commonly used for site headers and site footers. \u2014 Ollie supports all of these features, and they\u2019re all beautifully-designed and super easy to edit and customize.\nA stunning pattern collection\nOllie ships with over 50 beautifully-crafted, pixel-perfect patterns. Patterns are pre-designed page elements that can be combined into page sections of full-page layouts. Preview some of these patterns on the Ollie demo.\n\nBuilding with patterns can significantly speed up the time it takes you to build your website. Simply add patterns to a page, edit the content, tweak the dials to your liking, and hit Publish.\nOllie\u2019s patterns are thoughtfully designed with a fluid design system, meaning your website\u2019s typography and spacing will automatically scale down gracefully to fit your visitor\u2019s device.\nFull-page templates, fully-customizable\nBuilding with patterns lets you quickly build out your own pages, but the Ollie block theme also ships with 6 full-page designs for going live even quicker! \n\nPreview the Ollie page designs:\n\n\n\n\nHomepage\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\n\nPricing\n\n\n\nDownload\n\n\n\nProfile\n\n\n\n\nWith a few clicks, you can insert a beautiful full page designs for Homepage, About, Features, Pricing, Download, and Profile pages. Between these full page designs and patterns, you can literally create hundreds of pixel-perfect combinations!\nCustomize to your style with Global Styles\nOne of the first things folks want to do when they get their website set up is customize the look and feel to match their branding. This couldn\u2019t be easier with WordPress\u2019s new Global Styles. \n\nWith the Ollie block theme, virtually every element on the page can be customized, and usually with a few clicks. With Global Styles, you can quickly change the site-wide color palette, change the look of individual elements like buttons, headings, links, and more. \nOn top of that, I\u2019ve included seven different color palettes that you can use to change the look and feel of your site in a snap. \nResponsive out of the box\nResponsible websites work on a plethora of devices, and look good while doing it. Ollie is fully-responsive out of the box, and you don\u2019t even have to fiddle with responsive settings.\n\nOllie uses fluid typography and fluid spacing to automatically scale down the design to fit on every device, from desktop to mobile. Responsive design is built into the Ollie design system, the patterns, and the templates. Everything you add to the page is automatically responsive, giving you more time to focus on more important things like content.\nBuilt to perform\nThe Ollie block theme is blazing fast out of the box, scoring top marks across the board in Google\u2019s Pagespeed Insights. Not only is it blazing fast on the front-end, it\u2019s also super speedy in the editor as well, unlike many bloated page builder plugins that slow down your site. \n\nOne of the most powerful performance features is the selective loading of assets. Instead of loading a large stylesheet on every page, Ollie only loads the styles needed on the page. This results in a much smaller page size, far less page requests, and an instantly-loading page, which search engines love. \nA new design for OllieWP.com\n\nRecently, I relaunched OllieWP.com with a new design, powered by the Ollie WordPress block theme. That\u2019s right, I built Ollie with\u2026 Ollie! This site was built entirely in the WordPress site editor with blocksBlocks Blocks are content elements that you add to the editor in posts and pages to create content layouts. Each item you add to your post or page is a block., and very little code was touched in the process.\nThe shiny new Ollie homepage showcases the theme\u2019s features, but it also is kind of a marketing page for WordPress itself. The thing is, WordPress has all of these powerful new features, but we\u2019re not really doing a great job of communicating how all of these features work together as a powerful new site building experience.\nTo be fair, it\u2019s a lot to take in, and I have an article in the works about this very topic. But in the mean time, if we want folks to start adopting this new paradigm, we have to shepherd them through this transition not only with great products, but great education and content that showcases practical use cases for building real websites.\nThis is just the beginning\nI built Ollie as a way of learning all of the new WordPress features, and I\u2019m hoping that others can learn from what I\u2019ve built so far. Although this is a very powerful v1, I\u2019ve got lots in store for Ollie, both the free version and pro features further down the road. \nUntil then, stay tuned for more block theme content, tutorials, and more with the Ollie block theme as a central focus. \n\n\nView Ollie Demo\nBrowse Github\nDownload Zip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you liked this post, you won\u2019t want to miss the next one!

I do hope so! Also: love the look and design of this. Excellent!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\nMike McAlister\nApril 26, 2023\n\nHey Brin, I don\u2019t have a blog sidebar yet, but that\u2019s a great suggestion! I\u2019ll create a pattern for that for the public release on .org.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\nBrin Wilson\nApril 27, 2023\n\nExcellent! Also, I\u2019ve just loaded a demo site up to have a play around in the back-end and I can\u2019t see any Header or Footer patternsBlock patterns Block Patterns are a collection of pre-designed blocks that you can insert into pages and posts and then customize with your own content..

Glad to see you contributing your minimal, elegant and ultra-specific design work once again.\nLooking forward to what\u2019s to come \u2013 you legend!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\nMike McAlister\nApril 26, 2023\n\nThanks so much, Mathew! That means so much to me that you were a lifetime customer. \ud83d\ude4c We\u2019re in a new era of WordPress themes, and I\u2019m excited to bring that same energy to the block theme world. Stay tuned my dude!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\nNoah\nApril 29, 2023\n\nHi Mike,\nthis is a really beautiful theme!\nIs it in any way possible to design the blog not as a list but in a grid (e.g. 3 rows with 3 posts each)?\nBest regards\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\nMike McAlister\nMay 1, 2023\n\nHey Noah, \nI don\u2019t have a design in the theme for this yet, but I\u2019ll add it to the list!\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\nBrin Wilson\nApril 30, 2023\n\nHi Mike, the default single blog post template seems the same as the wide one. Is there an example of what the wide template should look like? Thanks again, Brin.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\nBrin Wilson\nApril 30, 2023\n\nDo all three blog posts on the live demo use the same post template?\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\nMike McAlister\nMay 2, 2023\n\nThis post uses the single wide template.\n\nReply\n\n\n\n\nMike McAlister\nMay 2, 2023\n\nHey Brin, \nThe wide one will stretch your featured image wider, past the content. You can\u2019t see this in the editor because the editor view doesn\u2019t show the featured image. Try applying it on a post with a featured image and then check out the post on the front end. \nPS if you ping me on Twitter about these questions, I can probably get you a quicker answer!\n\nReply\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
