She argues that tool use could be genetically hardwired as well as have some element of learning. \"We are looking at a gradient, with some animals such as assassin bugs being closer to the genetically hardwired and others, such as primates and octopuses, incorporating more learning into their tool use,\" she said.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\nUCR in the News\nTread lightly to protect California\u2019s superblooms\n\n\nScribd / Futurity\n\n  |\n  April 25, 2023\n\n\n  In remote places, hiking off trails isn\u2019t going to destroy the wildflowers forever since\u00a0seeds can lie dormant\u00a0in the soil for many years. However, UCR plant ecologist Loralee Larios says that in highly visited locations, so many people walk off trail that within a few weeks, only a few patches of wildflowers remain. That means fewer flowers will return during the next potential superbloom.\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\nUCR in the News\nProgram at UC Riverside aims to deliver more doctors to Inland Empire\n\n\nThe Press Enterprise\n\n  |\n  April 24, 2023\n\n\n  The Inland Empire has a doctor shortage, but a program at\u00a0UCR intends to help solve the problem.\u00a0\u201cA huge push with this initiative is to really get more doctors into primary care, which fits right into our UCR School of Medicine mission for more homegrown physicians who want to be addressing that shortage,\u201d said Teresa Cofield, director of Pathway Programs at the UCR School of Medicine.\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\nUCR in the News\nYou \u2014 yes, you \u2014 are going to pay for the century-old mistake that\u2019s draining the Colorado River\n\n\nVox\n\n  |\n  April 18, 2023\n\n\n  Farmland is almost certainly going to shrink in the coming years, said Kurt Schwabe, an economist who studies water and agriculture at UCR.\u00a0Should\u00a0farmers grow less food, consumers will likely feel the pain.\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\nUCR in the News\n\u2018Silent killer\u2019 ends more American lives than obesity, drug ODs: new data\n\n\nNew York Post\n\n  |\n  April 17, 2023\n\n\n  Poverty is the nation\u2019s fourth leading cause of death, killing an estimated 183,000 Americans aged 15 and up in 2019, according to new findings of a study led by\u00a0David Brady, a professor of public policy at UCR.\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\nUCR in the News\nThe Biggest Killers of Americans: Heart Disease, Cancer\u2014and Being Poor\n\n\nGizmodo\n\n  |\n  April 17, 2023\n\n\n  David Brady, a UCR professor of public policy, led a study estimating\u00a0roughly 180,000 poverty-related deaths among people over the age of 15 in 2019\u2014a total only surpassed by deaths from heart disease, cancer, and smoking that year.\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\nUCR in the News\nPoverty kills more Americans than obesity, guns and drugs: study\n\n\nNBC\n\n  |\n  April 17, 2023\n\n\n  UCR professor of public policy David Brady, who led a study about the causes of death in America, said, \u201cPoverty kills as much as dementia, accidents, stroke, Alzheimer's, and diabetes.\"\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of California, Riverside\n\n900 University Ave.\n            Riverside, CA 92521\nTel: (951) 827-1012\n\n\nUCR Library\nCampus Status\nCampus Store\nCareer Opportunities\nDiversity\nMaps and Directions\nVisit UCR\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of California, Riverside\n\n             900 University Ave.\n            Riverside, CA 92521                         \n tel: (951) 827-0000                        email: webmaster@ucr.edu \n\n\n Find Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\n\n\nUCR News Archive\n\nScience Today\n\nServicio de Informaci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1ol\n\nUC Agricultural and Natural Resources news\n\nUC Newsroom\n\nAvailable Feeds\n\nCreator State Podcast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Us:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Accessibility\nTerms and Conditions\n\u00a9 2023 Regents of the University of California\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us help you with your search\n\n\nEnter your Search Criteria.\n\n\n\nSearch All UCR\n\n\nSearch This Site\n\n\nCancel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
