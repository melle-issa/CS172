Equity aims to address and correct historical and systemic injustices and ensure that everyone has the opportunity to succeed.Inclusion refers to a state of being valued, respected, and supported. It\u2019s about focusing on the needs of every individual and ensuring the right conditions are in place for each person to achieve their full potential.Information TechnologyKendall Hall, 109www.csuchico.edu/itSupport Our CollegeMore in our divisionComputing & Communication ServicesCreative Media & TechnologyEnterprise ApplicationsInformation SecurityInstitutional Research and Strategic Analytics (IRSA)IT Administrative ServiceIT Support ServicesTechnology Equity and Inclusion\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.Contact UsNeed Help?FacebookFacebookTwitterTwitterInstagramInstagramReport an accessibility issueReport a broken link on this pageTitle IXPrivacy PolicyCalifornia State University, Chico400 West First StreetChico, CA 95929Copyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n",
