The plan helps students and families budget for a UC education by keeping UC tuition stable and predictable and providing new resources for financial aid. Beginning fall 2022, tuition will be adjusted for each incoming undergraduate class but will subsequently remain flat until the student graduates, for up to six years. For undergraduates who first enrolled in fall 2021 or earlier\u2014including all current undergraduates\u2014tuition will stay flat at current rates for the duration of their enrollment, up to six years. The plan will be up for reauthorization by the Board of Regents in five years. The plan provides unprecedented predictability for families in helping to manage their educational costs while allowing the University to provide greater financial aid for the majority of UC\u2019s lowest income students, preserve the excellence of its academic and research programs, and expand enrollment of California students.\nLearn more about the Tuition Stability Plan\u00a0\u00bb\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Tuition Stability Plan?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is a multiyear plan starting fall 2022 that sets UC tuition for undergraduates, both freshmen and transfer students, at the time of enrollment, with the expectation that those charges should remain at that same level each following year for the duration of their college careers, up to six academic years. For graduate students, tuition for new and continuing students will be set annually but will rise no faster than inflation, essentially remaining flat in constant dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan I appeal my UC tuition rate?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour tuition is set based on the first term in which you enroll at UC. If you believe your UC tuition rate is inaccurate because it is assessed based on an academic year different from that in which you first enrolled at UC, then you may appeal to your local campus. See the Office of the Registrar at your home campus for information on where and how to appeal. Note that students who are pursuing their second bachelors will be assessed at the rate for the term in which they first enroll for this course of study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if I need to take a leave of absence or withdraw?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents have six consecutive academic years as of the fall term of the academic year in which they first enroll as a degree-seeking student at UC where they maintain their tuition rate (e.g., students who first enroll in fall 2022 or spring 2023 will be eligible to retain their tuition rates through spring 2028). If you have exceeded your six-year window and have an extraordinary circumstance, you may appeal to your home campus. See the Office of the Registrar at your home campus for information on where and how to appeal. Otherwise, you are assessed at the oldest unexpired tuition rate for each additional year you attend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat charges are included in the Tuition Stability Plan?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tuition Stability Plan includes Tuition, the Student Services Fee and undergraduate Nonresident Supplemental Tuition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the Tuition Stability Plan apply to both freshmen and transfer students?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. Both incoming freshmen and transfer students who attend UC fall 2022 and beyond can assume that their base Tuition, Student Services Fee and Nonresident Supplemental Tuition levels (if applicable) should remain the same for up to six academic years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the plan apply to undergraduate students from outside California?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. Undergraduate Nonresident Supplemental Tuition is included in the systemwide charges that are expected to stay the same once a student enrolls, for up to six academic years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will costs change for incoming freshmen and transfer students in fall 2022?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUC tuition for undergraduates who start at UC in the 2022-23 academic year will cost about $534 more than UC\u2019s current tuition. That\u2019s a 4.2 percent increase. That cost is expected to remain constant until a student graduates, for up to six years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am planning to apply to UC for fall 2022 or later. How does this affect me?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncoming California undergraduates for fall 2022 will pay $534 (4.2 percent) more in tuition and fees, but that cost will remain constant until they graduate, for up to six years. There will also be modest increases for new incoming classes in subsequent years. The plan pins inflation to a three-year rolling average of the California Consumer Price Index, and overall increases (a portion of which is inflation) under the proposal will be capped at 5 percent unless changed by the Board of Regents. The plan will be up for reauthorization by the Board in July 2026. Any changes would be expected to apply to the subsequent academic year, 2027-28.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuition & financial aid\n\n\nApply for financial aid\n\n\nTypes of aid\n\nHow aid works\nEstimate your aid \n\nTuition & cost of attendance\n\nTuition Stability Plan\nAB 540 nonresident tuition exemption \n\n\nGlossary & resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know?\nMore than\n55%\nof UC's California undergrads pay no tuition\nThat's because UC has one of the strongest financial aid programs in the country.
