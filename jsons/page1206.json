The multi-day orientation will introduce you to the rich academic, social, and cultural life at Stanford. Plan to arrive to campus and move in to your residence on September 19 by 5:00 p.m.\nIf you are selected to participate in a pre-orientation program, you will need to arrive to campus a few days earlier. Dates and details will be provided by your program. International Student Orientation\u00a0(ISO) will begin on Saturday, September 16. Students who are not US citizens/permanent residents are required to attend ISO. More information will be provided soon.\nWe invite family members to accompany your students to Move-In Day and the first day of NSO, September 19-20. Welcome events for students and families, including our Opening Convocation Ceremony, will be held on these days.\u00a0Plan to say your goodbyes before dinner on September 20, so that students can join their dormmates for their first dinner and house meeting together.\nIf you arrive to the area before Move-In Day,\u00a0we recommend that you book local lodging, as you cannot move in earlier than your designated move-in day.\u00a0Local Lodging Guide\n2023 Move-In and New Student Orientation information will be updated online this summer.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \nStanford Indigenous Land Acknowledgment\nStanford sits on the ancestral land of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe. This land was and continues to be of great importance to the Ohlone people. Consistent with our values of community and inclusion, we have a responsibility to acknowledge, honor, and make visible the University\u2019s relationship to Native peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \nA Note About Accessibility & Accommodations\nAccommodations are available for those with accessibility or disability needs during New Student Orientation.
