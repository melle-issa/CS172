It tests uncached performance.\nThe key metrics are:\n\nTotal Requests - Number of requests k6 made\nTotal Errors - Number of error requests\np95 - The 95th percentile response time\nPage Cum Avg - Cumulative average response time for Pages (html)\nAsset Cum Avg - Cumulative average response time for Assets (css, js, images)\nLogin Cum Avg - Cumulative average response time for Login (wp-profile.php)\nWP-Login Avg Response Time - Average response time for login (301 redirect which validates credentials)\n\n \nResults Table\nCompanyTotal RequestsTotal ErrorsPeak RpsAverage RpsP95Page Cum AvgAsset Cum AvgLogin Cum AvgWp-login Average Response TimeCloudways 13015631766591128.75711671227293276157Nexcess 94817330796.25515509300149291267Pressable 10630600870.8357830919570230205Presslabs 11032270909.0860121915813166151raidboxes 7712530627.174182831158032616471465Servebolt 121249901062.1765925621319217199Servebolt ACD 120957331069.565727122925229221 Discussion\n\nNexcess, Pressable, Presslabs, and both Servebolt plans handled this test without any issues.\n\nCloudways started erroring around 900 VUsers.\n\nRaidboxes started to show signs of load around 1900 VUsers and had increasing response times.          \nK6 Static Testing Results\nK6 Static test is designed to test cached performance by repeatedly requesting the homepage.\n \nResults Table\nCompanyRequestsErrorsPeak RpsAverage Response TimeAverage RpsP95Cloudways 148644303280.332121630489Nexcess 144270303181.672481580473Pressable 179095303939.55.9196619Presslabs 177700603908.6714194653raidboxes 143166403158.172581572583Servebolt 153157293368.671761629283Servebolt ACD 173792903849.3337190850 Discussion\n\n\n          Every company handled the static test near flawlessly. Zero total errors for all companies. The average and P95 response times show which companies have CDNs (or more relevant CDN locations for our test). The difference between Servebolt and Servebolt with Accelerated Domains is pretty clear here, ACD is adding a lot of speed.          \nUptime Testing Results\nUptime is monitored by two companies: HetrixTools and Uptime Robot. A self hosted monitor was also run in case there was a major discrepancy between the two third party monitors.\n \nResults Table\nCompanyUptime RobotHetrixCloudways 99.99699.8954Nexcess 99.99699.9926Pressable 99.994100Presslabs 10099.9955raidboxes 99.99199.99Servebolt 100100Servebolt ACD 10099.9888 Discussion\n\n\n          Everyone except Cloudways had near perfect uptime. Cloudways had an issue across multiple tests where one monitor struggled for a short window but the other was reporting it fine.          \nWebPageTest Testing Results\nWebPageTest fully loads the homepage and records how long it takes from 12 different locations around the world. Result are measured in seconds.\n \nResults Table\nCompanyVirginiaCaliforniaSalt Lake CityLondonFrankfurtCape TownSingaporeMumbaiTokyoSydneyBrazilDubaiAverageCloudways 0.1790.3890.3620.470.521.2051.1361.1190.8251.0640.6581.0110.7448333333Nexcess 0.3340.5250.4690.5861.0561.7011.341.4320.9031.5961.1621.8211.077083333Pressable 0.2150.3350.3150.2310.1870.2540.2440.6610.2450.1740.3160.4670.3036666667Presslabs 0.1730.140.2620.1520.1840.210.1480.1670.170.150.1610.140.1714166667raidboxes 0.6870.930.8750.2220.2260.8950.910.8011.2671.571.1550.7030.8534166667Servebolt 0.3560.2970.4330.5770.6780.9881.0170.9720.7740.8420.6770.9610.7143333333Servebolt ACD 0.4140.4520.490.2970.30.2770.4680.4770.4980.2620.5280.2790.3951666667 Discussion\n\n\n          Presslabs went a perfect 12/12 as the fastest in every region. Pressable was the second fastest with Servebolt + ACD not far behind.          \nWPPerformanceTester Testing Results\nWPPerformanceTester performs two benchmarks. One is a WordPress (WP Bench) and the other is a PHP Bench. WP Bench measures how many WP queries per second and higher tends to be better (varies considerably by architecture). PHP Bench performs a lot of computational and some database operations which are measured in seconds to complete. Lower PHP Bench is better.\n \nResults Table\nCompanyPHP BenchWP BenchCloudways 8.993478.6979416Nexcess 7.7281044.932079Pressable 10.0131347.708895Presslabs 6.891538.461538raidboxes 7.9711466.27566Servebolt 5.862222.222222Servebolt ACD 5.8652207.505519 Discussion\n\n\n          Both Servebolt plans stood out as having the fastest scores in both tests which were near identical to one another.          \nSSL Testing Results\nThe tool is available at https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/\nResults Table\nCompanyQualsys SSL GradeCloudways ANexcess APressable APresslabs A+raidboxes A+Servebolt AServebolt ACD A+ Discussion\n\n\n          Everyone got an A with Presslabs, Raidboxes and Servebolt+ACD Earning A+.          \n\nConclusion\nThere are two levels of recognition awarded to companies that participate in the tests. There is no \u2018best\u2019 declared, it\u2019s simply tiered, it\u2019s hard to come up with an objective ranking system because of the complex nature of hosting. These tests also don\u2019t take into account outside factors such as reviews, support, and features. It is simply testing performance as described in the methodology.\nTop Tier\nThis year's Top Tier WordPress Hosting Performance Award goes to the following companies who showed virtually no signs of struggle during the testing.\n Nexcess     Pressable     Presslabs     Servebolt     Servebolt ACD     \nHonorable Mention\nThe following companies earned Honorable Mention status because they did very well and had a minor issue or two holding them back from earning Top Tier status.\nNo company achieved this status. \nIndividual Host Analysis\n Cloudways Cloudways handled the static test without issue. Cloudways had great uptime on one monitor and lower than expected on the other. This seemed like it maybe was a bug and showed on every Cloudways monitor on the Hetrix Tools platform. Unfortunately, the Load Storm caused the server to error out and fail the test. I'm not sure what happened but I hope they figure it out and we see a comeback next year.Visit Cloudways  Website Nexcess    Nexcess had stellar uptime with both showing above 99.99%. Nexcess also handled the static and Load Storm tests without issue. While it didn't particularly stand out compared to some of it's peers, it delivered flawless results on everything we threw at it. Top Tier.Visit Nexcess  Website Pressable    Pressable had the fastest average and p95 load times on the static test. Pressable also picked up the 2nd fastest page response time in the Load Storm test. Pressable had perfect or near perfect uptime.  Unsurprisingly, yet another Top Tier performance for Pressable - Well done.Visit Pressable  Website Presslabs    Presslabs had the fastest P95, Page, Asset and login response times on the Load Storm test. Presslabs had the second fastest average response time and third fastest p95 on the static test. Throw in perfect or near perfect uptime. Presslabs also went 12/12 as the fastest location for every test on WebPageTest. Overall, a very impressive performance put on Presslabs which saw them at the top or near the top of every test. Top Tier.Visit Presslabs  Website raidboxes Raidboxes had an excellent 99.99%+ on both uptime monitors. The Static test was handled without issue. Unfortunately the Load Storm test was a bit too much and slowed the server down below the acceptable threshold of 1000ms to earn any recognition this year.Visit raidboxes  Website Servebolt    Servebolt picked up 2nd fastest P95, asset and login response times in the Load Storm test. Servebolt had perfect uptime. Servebolt stood out as the fastest on the PHP and WP Benchmarks in a virtual tie with its other offering. Servebolt earned yet another Top Tier honor.Visit Servebolt  Website Servebolt ACD    Servebolt + ACD really shined over its sister product in the static load test and earned itself the 2nd fastest p95 load time. Servebolt + ACD picked up 3rd fastest P95, asset and login response times in the Load Storm test. Servebolt had perfect and near perfect uptime on the monitors. Servebolt stood out as the fastest on the PHP and WP Benchmarks in a virtual tie with its other offering. The ACD addition didn't slow Servebolt down, it doubled down on a second Top Tier award.Visit Servebolt ACD  Website\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\n\n\nKevin Ohashi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Ohashi is the geek-in-charge at Review Signal.
