The one we were taught in high school: Introduction, three concrete paragraphs, then conclusion? Some might have even shown it as a hamburger with each bun, lettuce, cheese, and patty paralleling a specific paragraph. Well, it sucks.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t misunderstand me. I think it has its time and place between learning how to write and well\u2026only during learning how to write, but anything past that holds no substance. No real weight. To stay placidly within that structure creates a kind of self bondage that doesn\u2019t translate into the real world. It taught us how to organize thoughts: but only in one specific way. There are a myriad of ways.\nGive praise where it is due.\nI do concede that if it hadn\u2019t been for that five paragraph essay, however, I don\u2019t know if I would have ever ran far away from it, to the opposite point of the spectrum and found my passion.\nUnpopular opinion: anyone who hates poetry is wrong.\nPoetry can be the opposite of the previously mentioned rigid structure. Run ons that just keep on going and going and going taught me that they are not the hearsay that I was taught and instead they have purpose and create an urgency that can only be matched or stopped by the use of fragments. Beautiful little sentences. Two words. Sometimes. Only. One. These weave focus and pointed meaning. Let us come up for a swallow of air. Everything I was taught never to use are the breaths that contribute to the lungs of the poem.\u00a0\nIt only takes one.\u00a0\nI always claimed I was a poet. Turned my nose up to any prose partially because I thought poetry was superior, but mostly because I had a disastrous writing experience at my community college that solidified my belief that I could never write fiction. Pair that with back to back heartbreaks and nothing can remedy the soul like a poem. And all was going fine until my last semester of undergrad where I stumbled upon a new medium to color my world.\nYou must know the rules to break the rules\nBut this also means pushing past one\u2019s own creative comfort zone: willingly\u2026or sometimes unwillingly. Writing does not live within a set of lexical walls and boundaries. It does not reside within a prescriptive fortress. It is formed from experience, from hopes and dreams, from fears and nightmares.\u00a0\nNow break the rules:\nMy very first class at Chico State was Literary Genres. I walked in ready to listen to the usual poetry/prose, nonfiction/fiction ideas and was instead confronted with the idea and possibility that literature is all around us. In the signs we read, in the syllabus we idly toss, in the posters held at BLM or Roe v. Wade protests. It was not confined to the historically straight male white cannon but moved fluidly in social media and also in the lyrics of J Cole.\u00a0\nTime and time again I encountered this stretch of norms and steered to uphold writing to the honor it deserves. Not by rules. By content, by ferocity, by impact.\nSo I consumed it all and took as many poetry classes as I could to move into the space I had been taught until\nI was forced to take a nonfiction class.\nAnd the only reason I took it was because my advisor \u201cencouraged\u201d me (basically told me) I should not take any more poetry classes. Maybe branch out a bit. Become a little more well rounded. Appalled and annoyed, I agreed and landed myself in a nonfiction creative writing class. Once again I assumed that I would hear the poetry/prose, nonfiction/fiction talk. Turned out to be one of my favorite classes at Chico State.\nIs it cheating if I still love both?\nMy creative nonfiction professor told me one day that I don\u2019t know where I had been hiding, or what this \u201cI\u2019m not a prose writer\u201d nonsense I had been claiming, but that I had to recognize that I was one. But the best writers of the field are those that read everything and try their hand, even for fun at a different genre. The five paragraph essay, though dull and terrible, gave me one set of tricks. Poetry handed me many more. Research papers, term papers about Shakespeare or projects on Walt Whitman, and reading Claudia Rankine\u2019s Citizen or Mai Der Vang\u2019s Afterland gave me more. How beautifully coincidental that the last class I take here mirrors the one that began my career. That I would work for the same Watershed Review that was handed to me during my introduction to this university. If there is anything we English majors take away, it is that we are taught to admire the complex ending. It does not come neatly tied with string but rather is up to interpretation and is full of twists, leaving it up to interpretation if it is the end or the beginning..\u00a0\nEven a graduate still loves a cheesy happy ending.\u00a0\n\n \n\nMay 24, 2022watershedcsuc\n\n\n\n\nWR Intern Spotlight: Graduate,\u00a0Student \n\nBy Jenna Welton\n\nCreative writing cradles the aspiring author in a cocoon of captivating craft elements and wild ideas. The undergraduate balances work and school, work, procrastination, and mind blanks.\nTry to stay productive because undergrad is almost over. You\u2019ve almost made it! Wildfires swallow the surrounding communities. Sit and stare at articles for hours without processing a single thing.\nSit bare naked and exposed in front of the laptop screen. There\u2019s nothing to hide but no words to write. Barricaded by the barriers of a traumatized mind.\nWait and worry about those pre-requisites instead.\nLet the pain dissipate gradually.\nGraduate.\nThe virus hits right as the imposter syndrome was starting to subside. Second-semester spirals. Home becomes school becomes work which became a cage as we scramble searching for a separate space.\nThis is grad school\u2014keep up the momentum. You\u2019re a grad student\u2014keep up the momentum. This is grad school? This is your kitchen, your living room, and your cat who won\u2019t stop getting on top of the counter.\nSummer swells with the exhaustion of the last semester and the scattered sentences of a thesis yet to be written. Autumn comes. Those page counts need to be reached soon if those deadlines are to be kept.\nThose deadlines are being pushed back again.\nA flash-fiction collection concept. Pages that seem to add up with every editing attempt. Try to expand on this. Please provide further explanation for your reader. We need more context. More inner dialogue, please.\u00a0\nFluid short fiction flows from the fingertips with ease. A larger commitment comes with wordier literary works. Suddenly the piece has inner faucets that need tending to like those loose ends and pacing problems. You\u2019d better revise any problematic plot holes or faulty character arcs as well.\u00a0\nDiscussion Questions to Consider:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20031. Who\u2019s the killer of the story?\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20032. Which twists and turns are too trope-thick?\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20033. Is this influence-soaked work even yours anymore?\u00a0\u00a0\nPiles of papers containing comments keep the thoughts flowing but at too rampant of a pace. The revision process returns once again. Try to reestablish what the work was hoping to accomplish before being dissected. Is it still the same story? Is it successful? What does successful art look like?\nWait. Worry about what happens after all this and after your defense.\nGet it together and let these extra months be your saving grace.\nGraduate.\n\n\n \n\nMarch 2, 2022watershedcsuc\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nWR Intern Spotlight: A Charge of First-Degree Writing: Almost Objective Notes from a Slush\u00a0Reader \n\nBy Morgan Konefal\nTwenty chapbook manuscripts. Hundreds of poems. Hours reviewing, pitching, and selecting pieces to share with a world. As an editor, this is the delicious bread and butter sprinkled with inspiration and cheddar cheese, lots of cheddar cheese. And believe it or not, depending on your astute knowledge of the enigmas of the publishing world, us editors are writers as well.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs verbally inclined artists, we are plagued (or blessed depending on your state of being) with a need to give a fraction of our jotted-down soul to anyone willing to hold it. Books. Zines. Facebook posts. A message in a bottle. Bathroom graffiti. A mother\u2019s day card that only one person in the entire world willingly wants to read.\u00a0\nMost importantly (and subjective to both you and me) are the beautiful forms of poetry and the literature that falls under the umbrella term \u201cshort stories\u201d. And as an editor, I am often asked by invisible and imaginary enthusiastic submitters: \u201cHow do I go from hopeful applicant to slapping Take That, Doubters! onto my list of published praised places?\u201d My answer? Maximum effort. Purpose. Passion. Think you\u2019ve got all the ingredients mixed without lumps or an accidental addition of Chemical X?

When approached to do this, the bold letters that screamed NERVOUS in my head could not be more apparent, my experience with Instagram posts limited to viewing, not creating. After some much needed research I was able to build a foundation for what it takes to make a literary magazine\u2019s Instagram work. Once I sat down to make a list of the essential things, I realized just how daunting a task this can be. Instagram is an important platform, the extent of design possibilities unknown. As well, using this tool to gather a loyal following can really make or break a literary magazine. Through my research, I\u2019ve come to see that two categories are the most crucial: design and connectivity.\n\u2026\u00a0\nDesign\n\nWhen thinking about design I knew just as much as my grandmother Mimi knows about Twitter, which is not a lot, but with some help, examples, and several books I was able to get a handle on a couple of important design considerations\u2014color scheme and font.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nColor\nWhether that is a simple color scheme like black and white which Instant, A Literary Magazine (@instantlitmag) does so beautifully, or a cohesive color scheme with a subtle color accent, like Shenandoah Literary Magazine (@shenandoah_literary), both give the viewer a full picture when looking at the feed from a grid without the eye getting overwhelmed. Another aspect to visual happiness is a design that flows throughout each post, Pathos Literary Magazine (@pathoselitmag) shows this with ease through their spunky cartoons.\u00a0\nFont\nFont, like color, is also very important when making a magazine\u2019s Instagram work. Robin Williams, author of The Non-Designer\u2019s Design Book states, \u201ca reader should not have to try to figure out what is happening on the page\u2014the focus, the organization of material, the purpose, the flow of information, all should be recognized instantly with a single glance.\u201d Keeping one or a few similar fonts consistent across posts is a way a magazine, like Honey & Lime Literary Magazine (@honeyandlimelit), is able to have a busier background but still keep a post soothing to the eye. \n\nAs a viewer I saw fonts as the most basic form of design, something I hadn\u2019t even thought about past MLA format, but now as a learner and creator I see it for what it is. Ellen Lupton, author of Thinking with Type\u00a0states \u201ctypefaces are an essential resource employed by graphic designers, just as glass, stone, steel, and other materials are employed by architects.\u201d This idea of font being the base for design is a great way of starting to understand the link between all elements that go into designing an Instagram post. Shenandoah Literary Magazine also does a great job at melding their fonts with the design, as well as sticking with just a few fonts throughout their entire feed. \n\nThe connection between the words, the image and the font needs to be strong\u2014an idea I am still trying to bring to life in my own mind. Scott Thomas, the design director of the 2007-2008 Obama presidential campaign explains in Abstract: The Art of Design, \u201cwhen you look at a letter form or you look at a word, does it actually communicate something deeper than the word itself?\u201d Thomas continues to demonstrate the weight of font by asking \u201cdoes it actually drive some other meaning to you, and subconsciously, I think all letter forms do. It comes down to what is the emotional quality that we are trying to say in this word\u201d\n\u2026\u00a0\nAt the end of the day we are talking about literary magazines, and so the text should be visually appealing, easy to read, and without errors. When stripped down, Instagram is there to enhance the core aesthetic of the magazine. The design and essence of the magazine should be shining through; all the ways listed above are simple steps to making that happen.\n\u00a0\nConnectivity\nThe obvious purpose of social media is to connect with followers. Instagram can be used as a platform for information sharing, event details, and calls for submission (to just name a few). More importantly, Instagram aids in creating a community for people who love the same thing to connect online and in person. At this time, when connecting face-to-face is ill advised, Instagram can be a great way to keep communities together remotely. While I may be a complete amateur when it comes to making Instagram posts, I can say with 100% certainty I am an expert viewer of Instagram. When thinking of my favorite Instagrams all of them include some form of interactivity.\u00a0\nPrompts\n\nSince the shelter-in-place order in the US began, The Poetry Lab (@thepoetrylab) has been posting daily writing prompts, giving their hundreds of followers something to do with their copious time indoors.\u00a0River Heron Review (@riverheronreview) has also done their part in aiding the people staying home with their post of \u201c7 Prompts for the Week Ahead.\u201d\n#fromthearchives\nAnother way to keep viewers engaging with previous issues of your publication is a reoccurring feature Watershed Review (@watershed.csuc) calls #fromthearchives. Featuring quotes from current and past issues of the literary magazine is a great way to connect viewers from the Instagram page to the magazine itself, hopefully keeping them there for a little while too! This practice of posting quotes from a variety of issues of the magazine is something many magazines are doing including Cream City Review (@cream_city_review), Ecotone (@ecotonemagazine) and Epiphany Magazine (@epiphanylitjournal), among many others. When adapting a technique many use, it is crucial to make yours stand out and ensure the creativity of your Instagram page matches the aesthetic of the magazine. As we have already established, I am a complete beginner when it comes to creating Instagram posts, so Canva is one way magazines have been able to make unique posts easily. It is actually difficult to find a literary magazine\u2019s Instagram page that doesn\u2019t have at least one post made on Canva, so changing up the color, font, and design of a Canva template can be as essential as proofreading.\u00a0\n\nHighlighting Writers\nShoutouts or Spotlights of past writers can be a great addition when trying to connect to a viewership. This can be done by recognizing past writers who have won awards, achieved something noteworthy like being published again or simply by posting their published piece in your article to show their talents. Not only can this give the viewer a varied reading experience, but also show interested writers the type of work the magazine is interested in publishing, express that the magazine is competitive and worth submitting to, and that the magazine values its past writers.\n\u2026\u00a0\nPaula Scher, quoted in Abstract:The Art of Design, explains that design \u201ccan create immense power\u201d by stating that \u201cbefore you even read [something] you have a sensibility and spirit.\u201d For a literary magazine, an Instagram post can be the viewer\u2019s first window into exploring the world the magazine creates on a page. The first impression is the most important and can be done through carefully placed flowers and lines, a choice between Arial or Futura and a whole lot of creativity.\nWritten by Lily Anderson\n\n\nMay 6, 2020watershedcsuc design, instagram, literary magazine\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nWriter\u2019s Voice Spotlight: Peg Alford\u00a0Pursell \n\n\nPeg Alford Pursell is an award-winning author, editor, and publisher. She has published multiple short stories, as well as two books\u2013the 2017 Indies Book of the Year Show Her a Flower, a Bird, a Shadow, and her most recent book A Girl Goes into the Forest, which has been referred to as \u201csharp and disturbing\u201d (Publishers Weekly) and \u201cdexterous in anatomizing the relationships between mothers and daughters, emulating Henry James-like restraint to articulate that which is left unsaid between them\u201d (San Francisco Chronicle).\nIn an interview with Litstack, Pursell who founded Why There Are Words (WTAW) Press spoke of her hopes for publishing, \u201cI want to publish books that are unforgettable. Books that challenge, that evoke and provoke, that immerse readers. Books that confront issues, and by that I don\u2019t mean books that must shock or that are in-one\u2019s-face, necessarily. I value nuance and subtlety and beauty. Essentially, I want to publish books that endure.\u201d Peg Alford Pursell is dedicated to fostering creative voices, supporting and helping to create a better and thriving literary community. She recognizes that in order to produce and publish works that endure the method is \u201cquite simply, to publish the best books we can find.\u201d Their publication embraces all voices regardless of cultural or socio-economic background.\u00a0\nHer most recent book A Girl Goes into the Forest (Dzanc Books) is a collection of 78 individual short stories, most of which are but a couple of pages long. Yet, all of which showcase her incredible ability to create atmosphere, and to carve out intimate and sophisticated relationships. In truth, in just the first pages of her book, I was savoring every word of her prose and jealous of the talent she was able to display within merely one paragraph. And it is in my own humble opinion that her stories are universal and will endure the test of time.\nIn the story \u201cOld Church by the Sea\u201d the story begins with a mother and her teenage daughter visiting an abandoned church by the sea, and slowly and subtly blossoms into a short but poignant meditation on the relationship between the mother and daughter from the very beginning: \u201cHaving and wanting at the same time\u2014that\u2019s what it was to carry my daughter inside me. After, I was emptier than I could ever have imagined, I thought then.\u201d Her prose is direct, effective, and leaves just enough unsaid to inspire the minds of the reader to contemplate emotions that are curious but also utterly familiar.\u00a0\nPlease join us for a thought-provoking evening with Peg Alford Pursell on Wednesday, October 30th at 7:30 pm in Colusa Hall Room 100B.

I woke up early and was watching Youtube videos in bed before my daily venture downstairs to make breakfast when I saw a new video from PBS Digital Studios, which releases a series of studies regarding certain facets of the literary world in a series called \u201cIt\u2019s Lit!\u201d It just so happened that on this day, they were discussing \u201cDeath, Personified.\u201d I watched, in awe, as they listed the endless examples of authors crafting \u201cDeath\u201d a physical character. I began to wonder: Why are writers so fascinated with death? I decided to launch a personal investigation and go in search of the truth behind this phenomenon.\nSo I asked professors and graduate students in the CSUC English department, what about the theme of mortality makes it such a rich muse for writers? I began to notice a trend in their answers. Most agreed the use of death and its symbolism in literature is an inevitable constant. Professor Matt Brown, who focuses on American Literature and Culture in his courses, offered, \u201cDeath may be the only universal human experience and nobody in the world can tell us what it\u2019s like.\u201d In this way, Professor Brown believes personifying death gives readers a way to feel closer to understanding death as a whole, without having to experience it firsthand. \nGrad student, Mary Gibaldi, who focuses on 20th-century American Literature and Feminist Theory, went a step further with her interpretation: \u201cNot only is death an inevitable part of life, but it is often linked to other themes writers tend to gravitate towards power, identity, the social and socioeconomic spaces created after a person\u2019s passing.\u201d Upon speculation, these themes, in correspondence with one another, is what drives most plots in stories. Death, especially, serves as an unwanted change that forces the reader to be more open-minded and grow in some way. \nInterestingly, Professor Jeanne Clark and Professor Rob Davidson, who both teach creative writing, gave a more poetic answer to the question. Clark reported, \u201cIt\u2019s inevitability. The way it forces us to ask the hardest questions, to make meaning of suffering, to find consolation; it takes us to our edge. The ways it opens our hearts & minds.\u201d Davidson added, \u201cSurely the inescapable nature of our own demise\u2014we are endlessly fascinated with questions of what death means, what happens after death, how death gives shape & meaning to our lives, and of course what one\u2019s own death might mean: a reckoning, a release, an apocalypse, a rebirth.\u201d The mere intricacy of these explanations adds the type of reasoning only a creative writer could offer. Somehow, their perspectives paint the concept of death as a vital and beautiful aspect of life. \nPerhaps, in this way, it has managed to remain timelessly relevant in all genres of literature. While this question may never be truly answered, this at least gives me some idea about why writers remain fascinated with Death. \n\u00a0\nFaculty Recommendations:\nMary Gibaldi: Daniel Woodrell\u2019s Winter\u2019s Bone, Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved\nProfessor Matt Brown: There are dead bodies all over almost everything I read or teach. Leaves of Grass has 15 corpses in it and it is, by far, the most cheerful and optimistic text I teach. Nearly everyone dies in Moby Dick. And of course, the blues songs and Appalachian ballads I love so much are all populated by murderers and the murdered.\nProfessor Jeanne Clark: Elegy, Edward Hirsh;\u00a0Elegy, Mary Jo Bang;\u00a0The Duino Elegies, Rainer Maria Rilke;\u00a0Brother, Matthew & Michael Dickman;\u00a0Death Tractates & Bright Existence, Brenda Hillman;\u00a0Trapeze, Deborah Digges;\u00a0Prayer in Wind, Eva Saulitis\nProfessor Rob Davidson: Dante quickly comes to mind. Faulkner\u2019s As I Lay Dying. From more contemporary authors, I am enormously fond of George Saunders. His story \u201cSea Oak\u201d is a zombie story in which a woman who, in her mortal life, was a passive pushover; as a zombie, she seeks lovers and adventure\u2014death becomes, for her, an opportunity for a \u201cdo-over.\u201d Sadly, it doesn\u2019t work out, but Saunders\u2019s moral is clear: carpe diem.\n\u00a0\n\n\nMay 1, 2019watershedcsuc\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\nWriter\u2019s Voice Spotlight: An Interview with Jos\u00e9 Antonio\u00a0Rodr\u00edguez \n\n\nRecently, I had the opportunity to read Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s memoir house built on ashes. Written in vignettes, the stories create a rich tapestry of Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s experiences as the child of immigrant parents, their impoverished life in Texas, his trips back and forth across the border to visit family in Mexico, and how he grapples with his emerging sexuality. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s brief vignettes exemplify his background as a poet with the work\u2019s lyrically constructed snapshots, oftentimes resembling prose poems. Written from Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s perspective as a young boy, the characters he portrays\u2014Am\u00e1, T\u00eda Eugenia, and his often-absent father, Ap\u00e1\u2014illuminate the immigrant experience and how it feels to grow up in a country where they are often perceived as outsiders. The memoir is a captivating story of a young boy\u2019s coming-of-age, his struggle to navigate the complex world located between two cultures, and his advancing sense of personal identity. \nIn preparation for Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s April 18th Writer\u2019s Voice reading at CSU Chico, I had the opportunity to interview him about his writing.\n***\nWhen did you first realize that you wanted to be a writer?\nInitially it wasn\u2019t a \u201cwant\u201d so much as a slow realization that perhaps writing could be a possibility, perhaps I had some talent and something that warranted sharing with a reader. That happened when I enrolled in my first creative writing course as part of my master\u2019s degree, which came after earning undergraduate degrees in other fields. I stumbled around for a while before coming to writing. \nHow did you decide to write house built on ashes?\nFor years I\u2019d been carrying a deep desire to tell my coming-of-age story because I intuited that it was interesting and significant in some way, though I couldn\u2019t exactly articulate how. Then as a graduate student at Binghamton University, I learned much about creative nonfiction but also about literary theory, which offered me new lenses by which to interpret my past, my experiences as an immigrant, as queer, as a member of the poverty class, as\u2026. Eventually I reached a point where I had a good grasp of both my experiences and their larger or deeper significance, which is necessary to reach the reader.\nWhat were you hoping to achieve with your memoir?\nI had two main objectives. One, to show the reader who shares a similar background that our lives of dirt and sweat and want can also be the stuff of literature, can also be artistic, valuable, and beautiful. Two, to show the reader who has a vastly different background than my own how the Other becomes other-ed, and how that Other may not be so different after all, if we recognize the social, cultural, and political forces that form and deform the self. This isn\u2019t to say that I presume to have succeeded at both objectives, only that those were my aims.\nWhy did you choose to structure house built on ashes in vignettes? What do you like about that particular form?\nI love the form\u2019s lyrical potential, how suggestive it can be, how much like poetry. It allowed me the space and rhythm to develop mood, to highlight the intimate details so significant to the narrator\u2019s deep desire for beauty and belonging, for home. Also, I think it worked well to echo the very nature of memory, which is fragmentary and mysterious.\nHow did you learn how to write in the voice of a child/adolescent?\nBefore anything else, I had to understand that the individual\u2019s past is always informing the present in ways both beautiful and terrible. And so I had to honor that past that I carry, accept the value and significance of those memories lived by my younger self. This felt more like emotional labor. Then came what felt more like intellectual labor: the mapping out of the institutions of power and influence that shaped the narrator and the ways they did it, from the macro to the micro, and then stripping them away to begin at the beginning. In other words, I learned about what the adult knows that the child doesn\u2019t know and how the child begins to know, how that knowledge comes to him, and how that knowledge and those \u201clessons\u201d are often contradictory or dissonant. For example, the memoir\u2019s adolescent narrator is conflicted about his sexual orientation and his sense of masculinity. If I want to make that significant in the narrative, make that something the reader ought to be aware of, I will want to show where and how it might have started. For that and other reasons, I had to include the memories of the narrator being ostracized by the boys of the village. But I had to include them in such a way that would communicate the young child\u2019s bewilderment based on what he did and did not yet know.\n What can you tell us about your forthcoming The American Autopsy: Poems?\nThe collection is centered on the various manifestations of violence in the U.S., from personal to communal, private to public. And it investigates the ways this violence challenges the nation and its subjects. That was the aim, anyway; we\u2019ll see what the reader makes of it.\nDo you have plans for other books of poetry? \nI imagine I do because I feel I have more to say and explore, except that I\u2019m not certain what shape the next project will take until I\u2019ve amassed a group of poems that might fit together. And how they might fit together is mostly a mystery until the project comes together. I\u2019m also superstitious about articulating the project before it has manifested itself, because the project may evolve, and my having already articulated its shape may prove stifling to its evolution. I guess I prefer to work in the amorphous dark.\nWhat\u2019s next for you? What are you working on now?\nNew poems. Translating the memoir into Spanish. Translating a Mexican poet\u2019s work into English. \n***\n\nBefore house built on ashes, Rodr\u00edguez was best known for his poetry. His works include Backlit Hour (SFA Press/Texas A&M Consortium, 2013), The Shallow End of Sleep (Tia Chucha Press/Northwestern UP, 2011), and Borderlines: Drawing Border Lives (Wings Press).

Often wry and satirical, she writes with a powerfully determined voice about women, writing, and travel. Her most recent publication, The Romance of Elsewhere (Counterpoint Press), is a collection of essays about intense wanderlust and the struggle of defining \u201chome.\u201d Lynn says the central question of the collection is \u201cwhere or what is home?\u2019 To which I\u2019d have to say, nowhere.\u201d She continues, \u201cWhich is not to say there aren\u2019t places in which I feel at home\u2014Greece, for instance, and the African bush. I also feel at home in the past. And yet there is also a certain liberation in being untied from the past\u2014from the bonds of home. And a sadness, a great sadness. As you see, I\u2019m still looking for an answer.\u201d\nFreed grew up in Durban, South Africa, and moved to New York as a graduate student to study English Literature at Columbia University. She is Professor Emerita of English at the University of California in Davis and has published numerous, award-winning works in fiction and nonfiction. Her most recent novel is The Last Laugh (Sarah Crichton Books), about a group of older women who flee their previous lives by moving to a Greek island\u2014something many of us have fantasized about. It delves into what freedom really entails and the dynamic complexity of friendships between women.\nOn writing, Lynn says \u201cleaving home is perhaps the central experience of the writer\u2019s life. The restless pursuit of a way back while remaining steadfastly at a distance \u2014 this is the enigma that informs the writer\u2019s perspective.\u201d By her own account she is neither fast nor disciplined as a writer. She says \u201cI\u2019m hard put to know which obsess me. The cult of the self? The self-promotion, selfies, self-this, self-that to which we\u2019re all subjected? Old age? Grown children?\u2026Something will come up, or nothing. If nothing, I\u2019ll try not to force something onto the page.\u201d The result is prose full of candor and wit that looks deeply at what it means to be a woman and what it means to be a writer.\nTo read more about Lynn Freed and her writing, check out this interview on The Rumpus.\nPlease join us for a thought-provoking evening with Lynn Freed this Thursday, November 1st at 7:30 pm in\u00a0Zingg Recital Hall (ARTS 150).

Michelle got her start like many of us: writing and hoping for the best, even when sometimes the \u201cbest\u201d takes us down a path we didn\u2019t prepare for. Tea doesn\u2019t hold back in her work as she navigates what being a person trying to stay true to themselves means.\nIn the 90\u2019s, Michelle found herself overwhelmingly surrounded by the testosterone and misogyny found in the literary community. Instead of retreating, she decided to take the initiative, grab the literary community by the balls, and create her own open mic with friend Sini Anderson. This new program, called Sister Spit, strove to create a place for the queer literary community to gather and share their spoken word. Tea\u2019s inspiration to start the group started with questioning:\n\u201cWhere are all the other queer female writers?\u2026They\u2019re not coming cause they don\u2019t feel welcome and it makes sense that they don\u2019t feel welcome. You had to really fight for a space there\u201d (Michelle Tea, Electric Literature).\nAlthough Sister Spit was originally geared towards cis women in the queer community, the fluidity of gender and the social acceptance emerging in the past years have pushed Sister Spit to widen their audience and participant demographics to engage people from all walks of life, so long as they vibe with their original message of \u201cfeminism, queerness, humor and provocation.\u201d\nIn 2003, Michelle created Radar Productions to give the queer community of San Francisco \u00a0access to free and affordable literary arts programs that they weren\u2019t finding in the male-saturated literary community. This nonprofit organization still hosts a traveling Sister Spit tour every year, featuring authors like MariNaomi, Wo Chan, Jay Dodd, and Virgie Tovar. In addition to her work with Radar Productions and Sister Spit, Michelle Tea is the curator for Amethyst Editions, a Feminist Press Imprint, and continues to strive to unapologetically share her art and create an inclusive environment for the queer literary community.\nMichelle Tea\u2019s new, razor-sharp essay collection,\u00a0Against Memoir: Complaints, Confessions & Criticisms, reflects on the cultural artifacts that have challenged and calibrated her against the world. She writes on \u201cArt and Music,\u201d \u201cLove and Queerness,\u201d and her usual spectrum, \u201cWriting and Life.\u201d In her writing, Michelle is someone we all can easily relate to. From pondering her personal struggles, to demonstrating what life means to her, Tea\u2019s life stories allow us to truly understand how our own unique situations are what define us. Her fearless reflection on times of previous struggle has allowed her to see her growth and acceptance, which is something we all can take from. Tea has a knack for slaying her inner demons and conveying her stories to the audience in the most comical way possible. Her overall style makes people think that we can still find light even in the darkest of situations. \nAgainst Memoir rebels against the traditional autobiographical text we have seen in Tea\u2019s previous works. In this essay collection, she interweaves her thoughts and experiences with film, books, and important figures to move past a singular narrative into a collective one about our time. Some of the pieces within the collection have been published from previous speeches, readings, and talks, including one from 2016 at Butte College. Within her work, she keeps her readers entranced with her powerful yet quirky assertions all while offering herself as a model for activism. In her essay, \u201cThe City to a Young Girl,\u201d she says, \u201cI guess that\u2019s my issue with writing as activism: how hard it is for it to change the actual systems that oppress and limit and kill.\u201d Through her writing we see a queer woman who fights for the freedom of those who are chained by the stigma of social and political views. \nOther works by Michelle Tea include Valencia\u2014which has received the Lambda Literary Award for Best Lesbian Fiction, and was adapted into a movie in 2013\u2014and the young adult fantasy trilogy Mermaid In Chelsea Creek, among many others. \nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Michelle Tea this Monday, October 8th at 7:30 in PAC 134 for a reading from Against Memoir, a Q&A, and book signing.
