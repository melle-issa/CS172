These institutes, which are directed by the Vice Provost and Dean of Research, Dr. Kathryn Ann Moler, are in line with Stanford's longstanding tradition of crossing boundaries to tackle large problems, engaging faculty and their students in collaborations that range from international and economic studies to challenges facing the environment, energy and health.Many of the labs, centers and institutes provide funding for collaborative research and offer support for undergraduate and graduate students. More information about those opportunities are on the individual web sites below.For more about Stanford's history and culture of collaboration as well as research results see\u00a0Stanford Interdisciplinary.
