However, times have changed and change has been created by people from all walks of life. The thread weaving the change-makers together? \nEDUCATIONThe NorCal Teach Up pilot project supports the planning activities to create distance-learning opportunities at the community colleges through teacher credentialing programs in our partnership area. This program specifically addresses the needs of rural communities by offering clearly defined pathways for completion for teachers currently holding a Short-Term Staff Permit (STSP) or a Provisional Internship Permit (PIP). Collectively, we serve and partner with over 130 TK-12 Districts and 14 County Offices of Education in the following counties: Butte, Colusa, Glen, Humboldt, Lake, Lassen, Modoc, Placer, Plumas, Shasta, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity, Yolo, and Yuba.\u00a0Education is the most powerful weapon which\nyou can use to change the world.\n- Nelson Mandela\u201cAs we observe children, we see the vitality of their spirit, the maximum effort put forth in all they do, the intuition, attention and focus they bring to all life\u2019s events, and the sheer joy they experience in living.\u201d \u2014The Child, Society and the World\u00a0\n(Unpublished Speeches and Writing) Maria MontessoriNorCal Teach Up ProgramsGet Started\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Started\n\n\n\n\n\nGet Started\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline & Hybrid ClassesStudent ResourcesStudent StipendsBasic Needs SupportWifi & Local Study SpacesCredentialing\u00a0Exam SupportAbout UsProject Purpose\u200b\nThe NorCal Teach Up pilot project supports the planning activities to create distance-learning opportunities at the community colleges through teacher credentialing programs in our partnership area.
