The site was formerly used for gold, sand and gravel mining, and is recovering from those activities.The property contains more than a mile of creek frontage, as well as habitat for many species of special status, including the Western Pond Turtle and Yellow-legged Frog. Butte Creek is critical salmon habitat and spawning grounds for the largest population of Central Valley Spring Run Chinook, a state and federal threatened evolutionarily significant unit (ESU).In December 1998 the Chico State Research Foundation purchased this site with grants from the US Fish and Wildlife Service, National Fish and Wildlife Federation, CALFED, and the Wildlife Conservation Board.The goal of the Preserve is to work in conjunction with other programs toward achieving a reasonable balance among the diverse demands on the resource base of the Butte Creek watershed.The Reserves have adopted an adaptive management approach to managing the property. Program areas at the preserve include habitat management and conservation, outreach and education, and research. The Preserve is open to the public year round.Social MediaEvents via Facebook\n\nBig Chico Creek Ecological ReserveIf you need special accommodation to access any document on this page, please contact the Office of Accessible Technology (OATS): Call OATS (530-898-6532) | Email OATS.Chico State EnterprisesAdministration Office 25 Main Street, Suite 203 Chico, CA 95928-5388 www.csuchico.edu/cse(opens in new window)530-898-6811fdnadmin@csuchico.eduRelated OrganizationsBig Chico Creek Ecological Reserve(opens in new window)Provost & Vice President for Academic Affairs\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.Contact UsNeed Help?FacebookFacebookTwitterTwitterInstagramInstagramReport an accessibility issueReport a broken link on this pageTitle IXPrivacy PolicyCalifornia State University, Chico400 West First StreetChico, CA 95929Copyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n",
