Last year, Contributor Day was overflowing with people from all around the globe, and in anticipation of a repeat in attendance, your help is needed to welcome new Test contributors, and provide a good space for open discussion.\nIn order to better support contributors interested in Test Team at the event, we are looking for 2-3 Test table lead volunteers who have experience on the team. Table leads talk about contributing in Make/Test, welcome and guide contributors toward resources, and overall, help new contributors make the most of their time at the event. See the handbook\u2019s Test Table Leads section for more info on this role.\nSo, will you be at WCEU, and would you like to help lead the Test table? \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Review the following items, and leave a comment below (or a message in #core-test, or DM @ironprogrammer or @Piotrek Boniu).\nYou\u2019ll need a ticket, so be sure to Register for Contributor Day if you haven\u2019t already.\nFirst time at Contributor DayContributor Day Contributor Days are standalone days, frequently held before or after WordCamps but they can also happen at any time. They are events where people get together to work on various areas of https://make.wordpress.org/ There are many teams that people can participate in, each with a different focus. https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/contributor-day/ https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/getting-started/getting-started-at-a-contributor-day/.? Make sure to review the WCEU site\u2019s tips to Prepare for Contributor Day.\nReview the Test Team\u2019s Get Started at Contributor Day handbook page, and report an issue for any needed changes or additions.\n\nDon\u2019t feel like \u201cleading\u201d at the table, but still want to help? That\u2019s cool, too! Having other test contributors around in-person or online (in the #core-test and #contributor-day channels) is a great opportunity to meet and help out. Please leave a comment below if you plan to be at the event or are participating remotely, and how you\u2019d like to help.\n\nProps to @oglekler, @estelaris, @ugyensupport, @shiponkarmakar, and @boniu91 for peer review of this post.\n#contributor-day, #wceuShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Login to Reply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPiotrek Boniu\n\n1:19 pm on April 26, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll be happy to lead or co-lead the Test table!\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYou must be logged in to post a comment. \n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\u2190 FSE Program Testing Call #21: Front Page Fun Test Chat Summary: 25 April 2023 \u2192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearchTesting Plugins\n\nDesign Experiments\n\nGutenberg\n\nBeta Testing\n\nBeta Plugins\nEmail Updates\n\n\nSubscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail Address\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSign me up!\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJoin 36 other subscribers\t\t\t\t\n\nCategories\n\nCall for Testing\n\nCore E2E\n\nKibble\n\nMeetings\n\nNUX\n\nstatus\n\nSummary\n\nUsability Testing\n\nVisual Record\n\nWeek in Test\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tTeam Pledges\n\t\t\n\n809 people have pledged time to contribute to Test Team efforts!
