We promote and practice evidence-based equity strategies, recognize the assets that all learners bring to the classroom, and embrace humility to continuously learn about the cultures, histories, stories, and identities of those with whom we engage.\nLand Acknowledgement\nInclusion Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInclusive Teaching\nCTL's IDEAL Commitment\nCTL is committed to honoring and upholding the value of all persons while working to create environments in which all students can learn and all educators can teach.\u00a0\nCTL Inclusion Statement\nInclusive Learning Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\nCTL Support\nWe offer pedagogical support for individuals and departments.\nConsult with CTL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\nStanford Teaching Commons\nHere, all instructors can find resources, solutions, and strategies from across the university to enhance their teaching and learning practice.\nExplore Teaching Guides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\nCTL Syllabus Template\nA customizable document containing reflection prompts, and links to resources and policies you may find useful as you craft your syllabus.\nGet the syllabus template\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching Support\nFaculty, Instructor, and TA Support\nCTL is here to support your teaching and your students\u2019 learning.

This land was, and continues to be, of great importance to the Ohlone people.

You can learn more about the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe here: Muwekma Ohlone Tribe of the San Francisco Bay Area.\nLearn more about Stanford's relationship with native peoples.\nInclusion Statement\nThe Center for Teaching and Learning is committed to honoring and upholding the value of all persons while working to create environments in which all students can learn and all educators can teach. We recognize that historically this has not always been the case because of factors such as structural racism, sexism, xenophobia, and ableism. We aim to promote evidence-based equity strategies that recognize the assets that all learners, instructors, and TAs bring to the learning environment. We advance marginalized voices through our programs and initiatives and embrace humility to continuously learn about the cultures, histories, stories, and identities of those with whom we engage.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \nStanford Center for Teaching and Learning\n408 Panama Mall\nStanford University\nStanford, CA 94305\nemail: ctl-stanford@stanford.edu\nWeb Accessibility\nStanford University is committed to providing an online environment that is accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities.\u00a0\nHaving trouble accessing any of this content due to a disability?\u00a0Learn more about accessibility at Stanford and report accessibility issues\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford\n\n \nCenter for Teaching and Learning\n\n\n\nWeb Login\n\n\n\nAddress\n\nCenter for Teaching and Learning\n408 Panama Mall\nStanford, CA 94305\nUnited States\n\n\n\nCTL Events\n\n\nCTL Newsletter Signup\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nMyCTL Intranet - CTL staff only\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching Commons Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nCTL Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsult with CTL\n\n\nRequest a Consultation\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\nStudent Learning Programs\n\n\nTeaching Commons Resources\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Center for Teaching and Learning is affiliated with the\u00a0Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education\u00a0and the\u00a0Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanfordUniversity\n\n\n\n\nStanford Home(link is external)\n\nMaps & Directions(link is external)\n\nSearch Stanford(link is external)\n\nEmergency Info(link is external)\n\n\n\nTerms of Use(link is external)\n\nPrivacy(link is external)\n\nCopyright(link is external)\n\nTrademarks(link is external)\n\nNon-Discrimination(link is external)\n\nAccessibility(link is external)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University.\n\u00a0 Stanford, California 94305.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Back to Top\n\n\n\n\n",
