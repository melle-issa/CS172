She remembers growing up with the chorus of the home crowd, the glow of the lights against the city skyline and looking over to find her dad with the biggest smile on his face as the players took the field.\u00a0\nWith a \u201cfamily tradition\u201d rooted in baseball, Baldwin\u2019s passion for sports and physical activity led her to Cal State Fullerton where she will complete her master\u2019s degree in athletic training this spring.\u00a0\nThe Class of 2023 graduate will join the Arizona Diamondbacks in May as an athletic training intern \u2014 the first step toward her dream of becoming a certified MLB athletic trainer.\u00a0\nChasing Dreams at Chase Field\nSienna Baldwin will start her athletic training internship with the Arizona Diamondbacks after graduation. \nFrom the graduation stage, Baldwin will pack up and move to Scottsdale, Arizona, where she will be working at the Diamondbacks\u2019 rehabilitation center and learning from their professional athletic training staff.\nWorking one-on-one with major league ball players, Baldwin said she\u2019ll be focused on injury prevention, rehabilitation and clinical evaluations.\u00a0\nDuring home games, she\u2019ll join the team at Chase Stadium to assist the staff with treatments and ensure that the players feel their best when they take the field.\u00a0\n\u201cThe structure of the program ensures that I\u2019ll be learning techniques and skills that are specific to baseball. They prepare interns for jobs in professional baseball, which is perfect for what I want to do,\u201d said Baldwin.\u00a0\nTitan Takes the Big Leagues\nWhen Baldwin began exploring graduate programs that would open big league doors, one name always came up \u2013 Jason Bennett, associate professor of kinesiology and director of CSUF\u2019s athletic training program.\u00a0\n\u201cEveryone had good things to say about his work at CSUF,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I interviewed for the program, it only took five minutes to realize I was in the right place.\u201d\nThroughout her graduate education, Baldwin gained hands-on athletic training experience, working closely with the men\u2019s basketball team last season and learning how to apply her skills in a competitive game setting.\n\u201cIt was the first time I experienced what it was like to work in an athletic training room with a Division 1 team,\u201d said Baldwin. \u201cThe connections I\u2019ve made and skills I\u2019ve developed at CSUF are going to last me a lifetime.\u201d\u00a0\nClass of 2023 graduate Sienna Baldwin (left) worked with Kyle Burnett to assist the men\u2019s basketball team. \n\u201cDuring her immersive rotation with men\u2019s basketball, she worked hard and gained the trust of the coaching staff and players. She was an integral part of the team\u2019s success this season,\u201d said Kyle Burnett, assistant athletics director of sports medicine. \u201cShe never wavered from the challenge and jumped on every opportunity to grow as a clinician.\u201d\nWith professional athletic training experience in minor league baseball himself, Bennett added that he\u2019s confident in Baldwin\u2019s abilities and has no doubt that she will succeed in her role with the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\u201cSienna has been a fantastic student in our program. She not only worked extremely hard in the classroom and in her clinical experiences, but she also was involved as a leader within our professional association,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cI\u2019m sure her tenacity and leadership will be an extremely valuable asset in providing quality patient care.\u201d\nMajor Plans to Work in Major League Baseball\nAt 4 years old, Baldwin already had a glove in her hand. Playing softball in the backyard with her mom, dad and older sister, sports have always been a huge part of her life. When asked why she chose baseball, she said it all goes back to Dodger Stadium.\u00a0\n\u201cGoing to baseball games with my family over the years made me fall in love with the sport,\u201d said Baldwin. \u201cThis career is a way for me to combine my passion for athletic training with my love for the game.\u201d\u00a0\nHer internship with the Diamondbacks will be the first step toward achieving her career goal of becoming a full-time athletic trainer for a MLB organization. Although she\u2019s happy to work for any one of MLB\u2019s 30 clubs, her dream is to return to Los Angeles to take the field with the team that reminds her of home.\u00a0\n\u201cBaseball isn\u2019t just fun for me to watch anymore,\u201d said Baldwin. \u201cIt\u2019s fun for me to work with because I like the challenge of looking at different players\u2019 physical routines and finding ways to help them get better.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\nFuture Athletic Trainer Takes the Field With Los Angeles RamsOne Pitch at a TimeTitan Athletic Trainers Join Olympians in Tokyo2016 Olympics: CSUF Alumna Makes Waves as Athletic Trainer \n\n\n\nTags\nEmpowermentHealth and Human DevelopmentOpportunityStudentsCareer ReadyCommencementKinesiology \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTaylor Arrey\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttarrey@fullerton.edu\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse\n\nAll News\nTopics A-Z\nAthletics\n\n\n\nFollow Us\n\nFacebook\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\nAbout\n\nCSUF Facts\nContact Media Relations\nFind an Expert\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\nSubscribe / Download\n\nSubscribe to our eNewsletters\n\nSubmit a Story\nDo you have news you\u2019d like to share with the campus?\nSubmit Your Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site is maintained by Strategic Communications.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTo report problems or comments, please contact strategiccomm@fullerton.edu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 California State University, Fullerton.
