CSUF police officers\u00a0are sworn law enforcement officers under California Penal Code Section 830.2, and in compliance with state statutes, meet the peace officer standards and training requirements mandatory for all California law enforcement officers. In addition, California State University police officers undergo training specially designed to meet the needs of a contemporary university community. All officers receive training in tolerance and diversity to better serve their community.\nCSUF Police Department\u00a0has a written agreement with the Fullerton Police Department, which defines and details operational authority pursuant to the Kristin Smart Campus Safety Act of 1998, Education Code SB 1729. This agreement designates which law enforcement agency has operational responsibility for the investigation of violent crimes (Part 1 crimes) and defines the specific geographical boundaries of each agency's operational responsibility. The bill further requires that these agreements be made available to the public and that copies of these agreements be transmitted to the Legislative Analyst.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime Information\n\u2022 \u00a0Timely Warning - Motor Vehicle Theft - 4/5/23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime Information\n\n\n\nDaily Crime & Fire Log\n\n\nClery Daily Crime & Fire Log\n\n\nCrime Information\u00a0\n\n\nCrime Mapping\n\n\nCrime Prevention\n\n\nReport a Crime\n\n\nInvestigations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocations\n\nFullerton Address:\n\n800 N.
