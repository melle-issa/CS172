Once enabled, it can be used to toggle the visibility of hidden content. This can be useful for presenting things like text transcripts for video blocks or simple spoiler alerts. By default the toggle is open in the block editor but closed on the front end. This is the first iteration, so the behavior of the toggle is still somewhat rough.\n\nAnother interesting experiment that shipped in version 15.6 is a command center for the Site Editor. It was created to be a quick search for jumping to other pages or templates in the editor. \n\u201cThis can be seen as a start on an extensible command and quick search component that can be used for way-finding (go to About page;\u00a0edit Archive template) and running commands (toggle top toolbar; etc),\u201d Gutenberg lead architect Matias Ventura said in the ticket outlining the feature. \u201cThe first milestone is to power quick search for content and templates within the site editor.\u201d\n\nGutenberg engineer Riad Benguella said his goal with the initial PR is to build the APIs and components for the command center but not necessarily implement all the commands. Ultimately he aims for this feature to do the following:\n\nThe command center can be loaded in any WPAdmin page\nThe commands and the command center are independent: Commands can be registered dynamically depending on the context\nSome small hierarchy of commands to be able to organize the items\nAllowing dynamic searches for commands\n\nGutenberg contributors are still considering how to organize and display commands better based on context, which is one reason why this feature remains behind the Experiments flag.\nVersion 15.6 also brings spacing presets to the Spacer block settings, allowing theme authors to create sensible presets and users to adjust spacing in a way that will look good across devices.\n\u201cSince the introduction of spacing presets, it became clear from community feedback that\u00a0spacing presets\u00a0should also be available for the Height control in the Spacer block,\u201d WordPress developer advocate Birgit Pauli-Haack said in the release post. \u201cThis\u00a0enhancement\u00a0in 15.6 gives theme developers much more flexibility over how spacing is applied throughout a site and enables fluid Spacer blocks.\u201d\n\nWordPress core contributor Nick Diego filmed a short video about spacing presets for the Spacer block, which demonstrates how fluid spacing work to help a site\u2019s content and design adapt better to different viewports.\n\nGutenberg 15.6 came out yesterday, and one of my favorite new features is spacing presets for the Spacer block.Fluid spacers anyone? \u2728 pic.twitter.com/k9NJSy05Xd\u2014 Nick Diego (@nickmdiego) April 20, 2023\n\nA few other highlights in Gutenberg 15.6 include the following:\n\nAdds border support to the Cover block\nMakes Style Variations accessible in Browse Mode\nList View now allows dragging underneath collapsed non-empty container blocks\nSmoother animations for Drop Zone in the canvas\n\nCheck out the changelog to see all the enhancements, bug fixes, and performance and tooling updates.\nCategory: NewsShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Like thisLike Loading\u2026\n\n8\n\n\n\n\t\t8 responses to \u201cGutenberg 15.6 Introduces Experimental Details Block and Command Center for Site Editor\u201d\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Stephen Vaughan says: \n\nApril 21, 2023 at 1:41 AM \n\n\nThe command centre brings real value in terms of workflow. I\u2019m impressed that we are seeing this in WP. We need more workflow feature like this to make it the block editor and FSE a better user experience.\nOther features like the option to turn off  the editor in posts and just have custom fields for pure data entry use cases would also be welcome.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Ignasi says: \n\nApril 21, 2023 at 7:24 AM \n\n\nI am happy that the new Details Block is being tested. I think it\u2019s a useful  block addition, I have tried \u2018Details\u2019 and for me it\u2019s ok.\nIn fact, I developed a similar block myself. Find it here: https://fusio.cat/blog/en_us/hide-or-toggle/  You can find more blocks in the block directory.\nNevertheless, the \u2018Details\u2019 block name is confusing. I understand than \u2018More\u2019 can not be used, but for me it\u2019s more meaningful something in the line of \u2018Hide and Show\u2019 or \u2018Toggle\u2019.  Even Accordion,\nAnyway, I think \u2018Details\u2019 it\u2019s useful and I like it.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Peter Shaw says: \n\nApril 21, 2023 at 12:32 PM \n\n\nNote. this is not a comment but a message.

Screenshot away, I still won\u2019t approve any comments that are insulting to contributors. We\u2019re trying to have respectful discourse here.

Its one of the world\u2019s best page builders.\nThat said, it should have been a plugin or a seperate project entirely. Its such a shame it is being forced on everyone as \u201cWordPress\u201d. I think its so clear that this was the wrong decision, yet Gutenberg developers are stuck extremely deep in a sunken cost fallacy.\nThe real heroes here are the maintainers of the Classic Editor plugin.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Khoa says: \n\nApril 24, 2023 at 10:44 AM \n\n\nOf course, it has to be in WordPress core. Phase 3 will overhaul the entire admin area with JS.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Stephen Vaughan says: \n\nApril 25, 2023 at 8:40 AM \n\n\nThough I only use the block editor sparingly and, it falls short for certain use cases, I agree that it should be in core because in many ways it\u2019s a big improvement over the Classic editor which has been showing its age for a long time.\nThat said the way it was implemented as default, requiring a plug-in to re-instate the older editor was wrong, when one can use a simple line of code in child theme\u2019s functions file or other custom plug-in.  A simple switch in settings would have sufficed for this and wouldn\u2019t have put the wind up those who still needed to use the old editor. Then again \u201cputting the wind up users\u201d may have been a deliberate move.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
