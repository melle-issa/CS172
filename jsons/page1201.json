Written in vignettes, the stories create a rich tapestry of Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s experiences as the child of immigrant parents, their impoverished life in Texas, his trips back and forth across the border to visit family in Mexico, and how he grapples with his emerging sexuality. Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s brief vignettes exemplify his background as a poet with the work\u2019s lyrically constructed snapshots, oftentimes resembling prose poems. Written from Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s perspective as a young boy, the characters he portrays\u2014Am\u00e1, T\u00eda Eugenia, and his often-absent father, Ap\u00e1\u2014illuminate the immigrant experience and how it feels to grow up in a country where they are often perceived as outsiders. The memoir is a captivating story of a young boy\u2019s coming-of-age, his struggle to navigate the complex world located between two cultures, and his advancing sense of personal identity. \nIn preparation for Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s April 18th Writer\u2019s Voice reading at CSU Chico, I had the opportunity to interview him about his writing.\n***\nWhen did you first realize that you wanted to be a writer?\nInitially it wasn\u2019t a \u201cwant\u201d so much as a slow realization that perhaps writing could be a possibility, perhaps I had some talent and something that warranted sharing with a reader. That happened when I enrolled in my first creative writing course as part of my master\u2019s degree, which came after earning undergraduate degrees in other fields. I stumbled around for a while before coming to writing. \nHow did you decide to write house built on ashes?\nFor years I\u2019d been carrying a deep desire to tell my coming-of-age story because I intuited that it was interesting and significant in some way, though I couldn\u2019t exactly articulate how. Then as a graduate student at Binghamton University, I learned much about creative nonfiction but also about literary theory, which offered me new lenses by which to interpret my past, my experiences as an immigrant, as queer, as a member of the poverty class, as\u2026. Eventually I reached a point where I had a good grasp of both my experiences and their larger or deeper significance, which is necessary to reach the reader.\nWhat were you hoping to achieve with your memoir?\nI had two main objectives. One, to show the reader who shares a similar background that our lives of dirt and sweat and want can also be the stuff of literature, can also be artistic, valuable, and beautiful. Two, to show the reader who has a vastly different background than my own how the Other becomes other-ed, and how that Other may not be so different after all, if we recognize the social, cultural, and political forces that form and deform the self. This isn\u2019t to say that I presume to have succeeded at both objectives, only that those were my aims.\nWhy did you choose to structure house built on ashes in vignettes? What do you like about that particular form?\nI love the form\u2019s lyrical potential, how suggestive it can be, how much like poetry. It allowed me the space and rhythm to develop mood, to highlight the intimate details so significant to the narrator\u2019s deep desire for beauty and belonging, for home. Also, I think it worked well to echo the very nature of memory, which is fragmentary and mysterious.\nHow did you learn how to write in the voice of a child/adolescent?\nBefore anything else, I had to understand that the individual\u2019s past is always informing the present in ways both beautiful and terrible. And so I had to honor that past that I carry, accept the value and significance of those memories lived by my younger self. This felt more like emotional labor. Then came what felt more like intellectual labor: the mapping out of the institutions of power and influence that shaped the narrator and the ways they did it, from the macro to the micro, and then stripping them away to begin at the beginning. In other words, I learned about what the adult knows that the child doesn\u2019t know and how the child begins to know, how that knowledge comes to him, and how that knowledge and those \u201clessons\u201d are often contradictory or dissonant. For example, the memoir\u2019s adolescent narrator is conflicted about his sexual orientation and his sense of masculinity. If I want to make that significant in the narrative, make that something the reader ought to be aware of, I will want to show where and how it might have started. For that and other reasons, I had to include the memories of the narrator being ostracized by the boys of the village. But I had to include them in such a way that would communicate the young child\u2019s bewilderment based on what he did and did not yet know.\n What can you tell us about your forthcoming The American Autopsy: Poems?\nThe collection is centered on the various manifestations of violence in the U.S., from personal to communal, private to public. And it investigates the ways this violence challenges the nation and its subjects. That was the aim, anyway; we\u2019ll see what the reader makes of it.\nDo you have plans for other books of poetry? \nI imagine I do because I feel I have more to say and explore, except that I\u2019m not certain what shape the next project will take until I\u2019ve amassed a group of poems that might fit together. And how they might fit together is mostly a mystery until the project comes together. I\u2019m also superstitious about articulating the project before it has manifested itself, because the project may evolve, and my having already articulated its shape may prove stifling to its evolution. I guess I prefer to work in the amorphous dark.\nWhat\u2019s next for you? What are you working on now?\nNew poems. Translating the memoir into Spanish. Translating a Mexican poet\u2019s work into English. \n***\n\nBefore house built on ashes, Rodr\u00edguez was best known for his poetry. His works include Backlit Hour (SFA Press/Texas A&M Consortium, 2013), The Shallow End of Sleep (Tia Chucha Press/Northwestern UP, 2011), and Borderlines: Drawing Border Lives (Wings Press). His latest book This American Autopsy: Poems is forthcoming in October of 2019 from University of Oklahoma Press. \u00a0You can read more about Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rodr\u00edguez and his work at \u00a0www.jarodriguez.org\nHere are some other links to a sampling of Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s work : \n\u201cSunflowers\u201d \u00a0(Poetry Foundation), \u201cOn Shakespeare: \u2018Shall I compare thee to a summer\u2019s day'\u201d (Poetry Society of America), \u201cDouble Glass Doors\u201d \u00a0(Connotation Press).\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, this Thursday, April 18th at 7:30 pm, Zingg Recital Hall (ARTS 150).
