The primary purpose of the Continuing Education units (CEU) is to provide a permanent record of the educational accomplishments of an individual who has completed significant non-credit educational and career enhancement experiences.\nThe CEU is a nationally recognized unit of measurement for any of a variety of programs that may apply to relicensure (e.g., nurses, pharmacists, accountants), promotion, or career advancement. These units are not approved for academic degree credit, but may be applicable toward salary increments for teachers and other educators. These vary among school districts.\nExtension Courses\nEvery spring, summer, and fall, the School of Extended and International Education offers Extension Courses for academic credit and professional enrichment. Extension courses are one way SSU offers university level academic credit resources to the wider community. The courses offer either academic credits, CEUs, or both.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Faculty and Staff  \n\n\nLive Chat with Us \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension Courses\n\n\n\n\n\nContract Credit Program\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram Coordinators\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuition: The Light of Inner Guidance\nDavid Sowerby,\u00a0\u00a0Ph.D., is an Adjunct Faculty Member in the Psychology Department at Sonoma State University.

Contract Credit courses are genernal offered by another agency, district, or individual consultant at their choice of site and are advertised by them. For example, contract credit is awarded for contracted professional development, as for teacher training when the SSU does not provide the actual instruction but does administer the awarding of credit. Contracted activities may also include non-credit for a specific audience, such as employees of acompany. (CSU executive order 1099).\nOur only responsibility is approval of the credit option, entering students into our registration system, and issuing a record of course completion to them at the end of the semester or upon request. All other arrangements for the course (e.g., instructor salaries, publicity, room reservations, class materials and hand-outs, video arrangements, etc.) are the responsibility of the contract agency.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJulie Shell\n\n\nContract Credit & Extension Courses Coordinator\n\n\n\n\n707-664-2396\njulie.shell@sonoma.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSU Facebook\nSSU Twitter\nSSU Instagram\nSSU Youtube\nSSU News RSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Ave\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n707.664.2880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact SSU\nPrivacy Notice\nCalifornia State University\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSafeSSU\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\nEmergency Information\nJobs\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
