We are dedicated to the inherent value of arts and ideas and the importance of imaginative and creative work. Here students develop as critical and creative thinkers who are able to communicate clearly in written, oral, and artistic expression; who embrace intellectual curiosity; who cultivate an aesthetic awareness of their world and contemporary culture; who employ appropriate theories, tools, and technologies in pursuit of learning; who use their education to contribute to the common good; and who are at home in a complex world. We hope you enjoy exploring HFA and all we have to offer!\n\nConnect with an advisor in the Success Studio.

We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.Contact UsNeed Help?FacebookFacebookTwitterTwitterInstagramInstagramReport an accessibility issueReport a broken link on this pageTitle IXPrivacy PolicyCalifornia State University, Chico400 West First StreetChico, CA 95929Copyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n",
