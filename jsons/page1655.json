There are 19 fraternities and sororities who belong to one of the three governing councils: the Interfraternity Council (IFC), the Multicultural Sorority & Fraternity Council (MSFC), and the Panhellenic Council (PHC), which make up approximately 10% of the undergraduate student body. When a student makes the decision to join one of our chapters, they are making a commitment to the pursuit of excellence in academics, leadership, service, philanthropy, civic engagement, integrity, and sisterhood/brotherhood.\nOur Fraternity & Sorority Life team oversee recruitment operations and provides ongoing programming and event opportunities to members of the community. Our fraternity and sorority community helps students to feel more connected to the university, establish a sense of belonging, and develop critical skills for undergraduate and career success.\n\nSonoma State Fraternity and Sorority Life\n\n\nVideo of Sonoma State Fraternity and Sorority Life\n\n\n\n\nFollow Fraternity and Sorority Life on Social Media\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 Social Media Accounts:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Student Involvement\nFraternity and Sorority LifeHow to Join\nResources and Policies\nPrograms and Education\nParents and Families FAQs\nChapters Conduct Status\n\nSports Clubs\nRecognized Student Organizations\nProgramming\nHow to Report\nResources\nEvents\nAbout\nContact\nGet Involved @ SSU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFacebook for  \n\n\nInstagram for \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Report\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterfraternity Council (IFC)\n\n\n\n\n\nMulticultural Sorority & Fraternity Council (MSFC)\n\n\n\n\n\nPanhellenic Council (PHC)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Interfraternity Council (IFC) is the governing and representative body for five national and\u00a0international\u00a0fraternities. The council is as a sounding board between member organizations and serves as a place to discuss questions of mutual interest and devise common solutions. Additionally, IFC meetings function as a common meeting ground to freely exchange ideas and perpetuate the growth of all member fraternities. The organizations place a significant emphasis on scholarship, civic engagement, leadership, and personal development.\nHow to join an IFC chapter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Multicultural Sorority & Fraternity Council (MSFC) is the governing and representative body for six\u00a0of our nationally affiliated fraternities and sororities. With four women's and three men's organizations, MSFC is home to many SSU students. As a community, the chapters seek to promote the general welfare and support the diversity of all students within the FSL community and beyond. Founded upon the principles of culture and creating opportunities for its members, MSFC organizations offer an experience that allows for the free exchange of ideas, programs, and services; promotes awareness of cultural diversity; and empowers students to use their voice to foster positive social change on campus.\nHow to join a Multicultural Sorority or\u00a0Fraternity chapter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Panhellenic Council (PHC) is the governing and representative body including six national (NPC) as well as international and two local affiliated sororities. PHC seeks to support, advocate, and enhance the experience of its member organizations and provide a venue for organizations to communicate and collaborate. Through community service and promoting women's wellness, the chapters contribute to the overall well-being of the SSU community. Through these ideals, the women seek to maintain an environment that upholds their values and amplify the true meaning of sorority.\nHow to join a Panhellenic chapter\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVision\n\n\n\n\nThe Fraternity & Sorority Life community at Sonoma State University aspires to be the premiere FSL community not only in the CSU system but in the state of California. Our Fraternity & Sorority Life community at Sonoma State University aims to be a model for all other fraternity and sorority communities in the region and nation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMission Statement\n\n\n\n\nThe Fraternity & Sorority Life community at Sonoma State University aims to foster student leadership development and individual growth by providing many opportunities both within their chapters and in the campus community.

My experiences with both Phi Delt and IFC have given me opportunities such as leadership experience, job opportunities, and a lifelong brotherhood. I have made so many of my friends through Greek Life and would recommend it to anyone who is interested!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCole Bertrand, IFC\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\"Being a part of Lambda Theta Nu has given me endless support and beautiful, ambitious and educated sisters who are a true demonstration of hard work and resiliency. Being surrounded by young and powerful Latinas, has made me step out of my comfort zone and go through new experiences that have enabled me to do things I could not see possible before. Lambda Theta Nu along with the FSL community have truly made my undergrad years the best.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNathalia Zavala Ramirez, MSFC\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u201cBeing apart of Greek life has given me lifelong friendships within my chapter and other chapters working towards my ultimate goal of greek unity.
