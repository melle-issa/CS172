Our documentation is volunteer-led and is driven by community contributions, and consists of articles and guides to using BuddyPress. We encourage everyone to get involved and help improve our documentation.\nEveryone may contribute or edit pages on the codex. To prevent spam, we manually access to the site to new contributors. The simplest way to do this is via the support forums with a new topic requesting access and mentioning one of the following people:\n@jjj, @DJPaul, @boonebgorges, @mercime, @hnla, @shanebp, @danbp, @henrywright\nSupport Forums\nThe most valuable way to contribute to BuddyPress is to help others learning how to use the software, on our support forums.\nTest & Report Bugs\nThe BuddyPress Trac allows you to file bug reports and enhancement ideas, as well as taking a look at the source code of BuddyPress and all the changes throughout versions.\nIf you think you\u2019ve found a bug, it\u2019s a good idea to search Trac first to see if a ticket already exists that you could contribute to. Otherwise, go ahead and open a new ticket!\nNever written a bug report? The WordPress Handbook has an excellent guide on what to do before you report a bug and how to write a good bug report.\nTranslate BuddyPress\nBecome a Translation Editor and select BuddyPress. Choose your preferred language e.g. German. Then select \u2018Stable (latest release)\u2019 or \u2018Development (trunk)\u2019. The translation needs to be at least 90% complete to be approved for the Stable/Dev languages.\nContribute with Code\nThank you for your interest in contributing to BuddyPress! BuddyPress is an open source project and as such is maintained by volunteers just like you. It is\u00a0vital\u00a0for the current and future success of BuddyPress to have a healthy group of contributors. You are very welcome to join us to work on making the plugin as great as possible : every enhancement and each improvement depends on the community. This Quick Start Guide to contributing code to BuddyPress Core is where you can find the resources needed to take you through the process of submitting your first patch.\nContribution meetings\nBuddyPress contribution meetings happen every other Wednesday at the #buddypress channel on Slack . To check the scheduled time, see the sidebar on the Development Blog.\n\n\n\n\nContentsDocumentation \u2192Support Forums \u2192Test & Report Bugs \u2192Translate BuddyPress \u2192Contribute with Code \u2192Contribution meetings \u2192 \nSubpagesCodex Standards & Guidelines\nContribute with Code\nProviding Support at the BuddyPress Forums\nReporting Bugs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog In\nRegister\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle Contributors\n22@mercime7John James Jacoby7Boone Gorges\nUpdated 3 years ago / Published 13 years ago\n\n\nWant to help?\nThe BuddyPress Codex is volunteer-powered, which means you can contribute too!
