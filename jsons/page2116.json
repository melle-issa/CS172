The student is able to view/print the form by logging into his/her Poly Portal (my.calpoly.edu) and selecting the Money Matters tab. The \u201cForm 1098-T Tuition Statement\u201d link will be visible in the Self Service section (below the gold \"Make a Payment Now\" button).\nStudents have access to their Cal Poly portal (and the 1098-T) for 2 years after leaving the university. You may, however, need a password reset if you graduated or took time off from attending. Contact IT Services at 805-756-7000 during regular business hours for a password reset.\nA paper form will only be mailed if consent to view online has not been given by the student.*\nIf the student did not receive a 1098-T form for 2022 online, one may be produced upon request. This request can be made by calling the Student Accounts office (805-756-1428) during regular business hours - Monday through Friday, from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, PST. The student will need a social security number or ITIN. A parent making this request must have \"Authorize to Release (FERPA)\" on file. A Form 1098-T cannot be mailed at this time, so consent to view online must also be given by the student.*\n*To consent to view your 1098-T online:\nFrom the Money Matters tab of the student Poly Portal (my.calpoly.edu), scroll down to the \"Self Service\" section and the \"Form 1098-T Tuition Statement\" link.  In the next window, select the \"Grant Consent\" button. Read the agreement and then select the \"Yes, I have read the agreement\" box on the 1098-T Consent Agreement page and click \"Submit\".\nGranting consent to receive your 1098-T via on-line access need only be given once. If you do not see the \"Grant Consent\" button, consent has already been given.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFees\n\nRegistration-Tuition\nFee Descriptions\nSummer Fees\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nLoans\nDeferral\nDisbursement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPay Online\n\nStudents Pay Here\nSupporters Pay Here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation\n\n\nFees\n\nFee Breakdown\nFee Descriptions\nFee Waivers\nSummer Fees\nFee Governance & Policy\n\n\nPayments\n\nWhat to Pay\nWhen to Pay\nHow to Pay\nPayment Plans\n\n\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nLoans\n\nFederal Aid\nInstitutional Loans\n\nExit Interview Options (Required)\nConsolidation and Rehabilitation\n\nLoan Consolidation Information\nEligible Loan Types\nLoan Rehabilitation\n\n\nLoan Repayment\nTeacher Cancellation Provisions\nObtaining annual Student Loan Interest Paid Information\n\n\nDeferral\nDisbursement\n\n\nRefunds\n\nFee Refund Policy\n\n\nHolds\nTax Information\nForms\nVideo Guides\n\nContact Us\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Accounts\n1 Grand Ave, Building 01: Room 211, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407\n                            Counter Hours - 8:00am - 5:00pm | Monday - Friday\n\n\n\nPhone: 805-756-1428\nFax: 805-756-2774\nstudentaccounts@calpoly.edu\n\n\n\nPhone Service  Hours\n\nMonday - Friday\n8:00am - 5:00pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit Twitter\n\n\n\nVisit Instagram\n\n\n\nVisit Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular Links\n\nFees\nWhen to Pay\nHow to Pay\nVideo Guides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9 \n\t\t\t\t\t\tCalifornia Polytechnic State University \u2014 San Luis Obispo, California 93407 \u2014 Phone: 805-756-1111\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\nWeb Accessibility Statement\nNon-Discrimination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
