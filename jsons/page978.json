Priority schools are not the same as\n  schools funded by Title I.\n\n\n  The priority school list is compiled by April 15 annually using\n  data submitted via CALPADS to the California Department of\n  Education (CDE) by each public California school.\n\n\n  Nonpublic schools are not eligible as priority schools as they do\n  not report data to CDE.\n\n\n  When determining an eligible school for employment, GSTG\n  recipients may refer to the GSTG Priority List published for the\n  school year they received initial GSTG funds or the school year\n  they are seeking new employment for after completing their\n  program.\n\n\n2020-21 GSTG Priority Schools List\n\n\n2021-22 GSTG Priority Schools List\n\n\n2022-23 GSTG Priority Schools List\n\n\n2023-24 GSTG Priority Schools List\n\n\n\n  Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\nGSTG Frequently Asked Questions FAQ\n\n\n\nHow To Apply\n\n\nSTEP 1: Submit a Free Application for Federal\n  Student Aid (FAFSA\u00ae Application\n  | Federal Student Aid) or CA Dream Act Application (CA Dream Act\n  Application).\u00a0\n\n\nSTEP 2: Golden State Teacher Grant (GSTG)\n  Application.\n\n\nThe 2023-24 GSTG application is now\n  open.\u00a0We will continue to accept applications\n  through April 1, 2024, or until all funds have been awarded,\n  whichever occurs first. Processing for 2023-24 awards will begin\n  in August 2023.\n\n\n\n  Next Steps\n\n\n  Once a student has submitted a GSTG application, they will\n  receive a confirmation email. The student\u2019s institution will\n  verify their eligibility and determine their award amount.\n\n\n  After the institution verifies the student\u2019s eligibility, the\n  student will be asked to sign their \n  Service Agreement (SA). The SA outlines the program\n  requirements, service commitment, and repayment obligation of the\n  grant.\u00a0\n\n\n  After the SA has been signed, the student\u2019s institution will be\n  able to request payment(s).\n\n\n\n  Contact Information:\n\n\nGSTG Coordinator Contact Information by Institution\n\n\n  California Student Aid Commission\n  Golden State Teacher Grant Program\ngoldenstateteachers@csac.ca.gov\n \n\nRead more\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter link February 1, 2018 \n\n\n\nPartnerships\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\nCollege Affordability and Transparency Center\nBureau for Private Postsecondary Education\nNational Center for Higher Education Management Systems\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter link February 1, 2018 \n\n\n\nCalifornia Campaigns\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\nRace To Submit Cal Grant Dashboard\nRegister to Vote\nAmber Alert\nCovered California\nSave our Water\n New Rule for School\nIf Called Conserve\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter link February 1, 2018 \n\n\n\nCommission Resources\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\nCal Grant Eligible Schools\nEnrollment, Persistence, and Graduation Data\nJob Placement Fact Sheets and Salary & Wage Information\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nCondition of Use\nCSAC Privacy Notice on  Information Collection\nSMS Terms and Conditions\nSubscribe to CSAC Important Updates \nHelp\nAccessibility\nScam Alert\nSite Map\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProfile footer link February 1, 2018 \n\n\n \n\n\nMarlene L.
