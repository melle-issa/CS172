Demand for our product and content grew to the point where our former host was cratering under the pressure; after serving one too many 5XX errors, we moved over to Kinsta, and the rest was history. Kinsta support deserves a special shoutout, as they\u2019re available 24/7 and go above and beyond to ensure our satisfaction.        \n\n\n \n\n\n                                        Zakariah Ramdani                                            \n\nfrom\n                            Hootsuite                                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            For any company that is serious about its internet presence, we would recommend working with Kinsta. There is nothing like having time to grow your business and the peace of mind that your hosting is in good hands.        \n\n\n \n\n\n                                        Manuel Carlos                                            \n\nfrom\n                            \u200bColorprinter                                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            We don\u2019t need to worry about hosting and downtime anymore.
