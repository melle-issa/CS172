As Sonoma State University leaders explained in a January statement: \u201cThe team is made up of civilian first responders, who respond to and proactively address calls for service\u201d \u2013 in effect, sending trained civilians who may be better suited to addressing such crises.\nThe Petaluma city website states that \u201cPetaluma is the first city in Sonoma County, and the first in the region, to provide a program like SAFE.\u201d Since launching in July 2021, however, SAFE quickly expanded to Rohnert Park and Cotati \u2013 and now to Sonoma State, which held a kickoff event for the program in the campus\u2019 Seawolf Plaza on Jan. 23.\n\n\n\n\n\nSonoma State is a S.A.F.E. Campus! We so proud to participate in this community effort to bring holistic mental health care to the campus and to Rohnert Park and Cotati. \u2066@SSU_1961\u2069 \u2066@SonomaStatePD\u2069 \u2066@RohnertParkCity\u2069  \u2066@CotatiPD\u2069  \u2066@RohnertParkDPS\u2069 pic.twitter.com/XZkAyeK14l\u2014 Karen Moranski (@KarenMoranski) January 23, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s not stopping there. Also in late January, the San Rafael City Council approved an agreement with Petaluma People Services Center to bring SAFE to Marin County, with a three-year pilot program kicking off in March. The new crisis team is expected to take about 4,000 calls a year, amounting to 8% of 911 calls in San Rafael, according to the Marin Independent Journal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a big deal! We are thrilled,\u201d wrote Elece Hempel, executive director of Petaluma People Service Center, in an email to the Argus-Courier.\nHempel went on to say that SAFE responded to more than 4,000 calls during the first fiscal year of the program in Petaluma. \u201cWe are currently 24 hours a day in Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Cotati and now SSU,\u201d she said. The San Rafael pilot program will begin at 12 hours a day, meaning traditional first responders will handle those calls when the SAFE Team is off duty.\nHempel and other organizers credit a group of Petaluma youths with bringing the program to the North Bay in the first place. Amid nationwide turmoil over police brutality \u2013 particularly after the killing of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests \u2013 these young people launched a local campaign focused on improving crisis response in their hometown.\nIn particular, they called on local leaders to replicate a program out of Eugene, Ore. called Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Streets, or CAHOOTS.\nLocal leaders took them up on it, and within a year the city and Petaluma People Services Center partnered to form SAFE. The new program kicked off July 5, 2021. Petaluma is now considered a leader in crisis intervention in Sonoma County and the North Bay.\nNader Oweis, chief of police for the Sonoma State Police Department, said he expects SAFE to be a big help for his officers. Referring to outside resources that can help support the university\u2019s police department, Oweis told the Argus-Courier that \u201cOne of the reasons we partnered with the SAFE Team was to make it easier to access these resources, especially when a community member may be in some sort of crisis.\u201d\n\u201cHaving the SAFE Team respond to these types of calls, including welfare checks, members experiencing mental health issues, intoxication, and other situations, either on their own or with us, would increase the chances of deescalating a situation and getting them the help they need,\u201d Oweis said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSAFE Team information\n\nAnyone located in Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Cotati or the SSU campus who wishes to request a SAFE Team response can call 911 and communicate with the dispatcher on whether it is right response for the situation.\nAlternatively, calling 707-781-1234 connects to a directory where callers can choose to speak with a 911 operator or a non-emergency SAFE Team staff member.\nFor general information on the SAFE Team, go to cityofpetaluma.org/safe or petalumapeople.org/counseling/safe, or email safe@petalumapeople.org. \nAn informative Jan 27, 2022 virtual meeting on the SAFE Team program hosted by the Petaluma Community Relations Council is available for viewing on YouTube.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATED: Please read and follow our commenting policy:\n\n\nThis is a family newspaper, please use a kind and respectful tone.\nNo profanity, hate speech or personal attacks.
