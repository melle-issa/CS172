This was a useful lens with which to introduce patterns and enabled many workflows (like copy and paste from the directory) without adding further edges to the block API. With time, we also introduced a utility block called wp:pattern to allow block theme authors to reference individually registered patterns dynamically, which has also helped with translations.\nThere are a series of upcoming features around #39281 we want to unlock that now require us to look more seriously into making this block fully powered:\n\nBeing able to designate a container that can cycle patterns within \u2014 just like template parts but without the extra overhead they entail. Shuffle content blocks when templateLock is contentOnly\u00a0#44581\nIntroducing patterns where the content is configurable on a per-instance case but the design and layout is shared and can be globally updated across instances. This requires developing the contentOnly property further to establish a set of attributes (role == content) that the pattern is then injected with dynamically.\nHelping the zoomed.out view properly focus on patterns rather than top level blocks.\nPossibly unifying concepts with reusable blocks where everything is a \"pattern\" just with different sync properties.\nAttach theme.json child objects to define a new set of style properties that only apply to the pattern contained within.\n\nAll of these features can be better conceptualized with the help of such a block.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              The text was updated successfully, but these errors were encountered:\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u2764\ufe0f\n22\n nerrad, dsas, carolinan, huubl, BogdanUngureanu, gigitux, annezazu, talldan, gziolo, ntsekouras, and 12 more reacted with heart emoji\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\u2764\ufe0f\n22 reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmtias\n\n\n\n\n          added\n      \n\n  [Type] Overview\n\n\n  [Feature] Patterns\n\n\n  [Block] Pattern\n\n\n  labels\n\n\n    Feb 26, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  This was referenced Feb 26, 2023\n\n\n\n\n      Phase 2: Customization\n      #33094\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Patterns as Sectioning Elements\n      #39281\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njameskoster\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nFeb 27, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n      Query Loop: Add a more visual state to the placeholder UI\n      #48013\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrobglidden\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Feb 28, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+1.  Ever since the pre-block era, I've wanted an instantiable thing in between patterns and custom (innner-enabled) blocks.\nThere were whole communities around \"parts-based\" classic themes using cruder tools of the day, and widget architecture was never quite enough.\nI'd like a souped-up wp:pattern to support a Javascript hook (preferably ESM enabled), sort of like what was added to block.json.  Would open many options and DX improvement too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  This was referenced Mar 3, 2023\n\n\n\n\n      Create a system for inserting site/post metadata into generic blocks\n      #37753\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Block API: Tracking issue\n      #41236\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njasmussen\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nMar 17, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n      Communicate sync'd nature of Navigation blocks\n      #49158\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaxonF\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nMar 20, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n      Sticky Position: Add a \"Make sticky\" action to the Template Part block\n      #49085\n \n\n\n Merged\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnoisysocks\n\n\n\n\n        added\n  the \n\n  Needs Design\n\nAnything that needs design efforts.\n label\n\n\n    Mar 27, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nannezazu\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nMar 27, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n      Proposal to rename \"reusable blocks\" to \"synced blocks\"\n      #34352\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nntsekouras\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nMar 28, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n      Pattern Directory API: Provide Hook for Third-Party Directories\n      #32696\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  This was referenced Mar 31, 2023\n\n\n\n\n      Fix template part area variation matching\n      #49500\n \n\n\n Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Reusable Block icon discrepancy \n      #46441\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmcsf\n\n\n\n    mentioned this issue\n    \nApr 5, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n      Lack of configuration endangers editorial workflow\n      #49592\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmfinell\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 6, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI dabbled with a solution to this but didn't quite get there.\nI tried creating a post type for creating layouts. In these layouts I would add some layout blocks and some content. I would also add a custom \"slot\" block wherever I wanted to be able to add editable content when using the layout.\nThe idea is this:\n\nCreate layout, with locked content/layout blocks and slot blocks for editable content\nInsert layout into the block editor\nEverything in the layout is locked, except for the slot blocks which work like InnerBlocks areas. In these slots any other blocks can be inserted.\nIf a change is made to the layout, this change affects every instance of the layout wherever it is on the site.\n\nThe layout works like the wp:pattern block. It server side renders all of the rendered html and creates InnerBlocks areas wherever there are slot blocks.\nImagine a block version of get_template_part. That's what I'm longing for!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAll reactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sorry, something went wrong.\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Copy link\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJiveDig\n\n\n      \n\n      commented\n\n\n        Apr 6, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@mfinell This is exactly the missing link of what is needed (IMHO).
