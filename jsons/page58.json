Often wry and satirical, she writes with a powerfully determined voice about women, writing, and travel. Her most recent publication, The Romance of Elsewhere (Counterpoint Press), is a collection of essays about intense wanderlust and the struggle of defining \u201chome.\u201d Lynn says the central question of the collection is \u201cwhere or what is home?\u2019 To which I\u2019d have to say, nowhere.\u201d She continues, \u201cWhich is not to say there aren\u2019t places in which I feel at home\u2014Greece, for instance, and the African bush. I also feel at home in the past. And yet there is also a certain liberation in being untied from the past\u2014from the bonds of home. And a sadness, a great sadness. As you see, I\u2019m still looking for an answer.\u201d\nFreed grew up in Durban, South Africa, and moved to New York as a graduate student to study English Literature at Columbia University. She is Professor Emerita of English at the University of California in Davis and has published numerous, award-winning works in fiction and nonfiction. Her most recent novel is The Last Laugh (Sarah Crichton Books), about a group of older women who flee their previous lives by moving to a Greek island\u2014something many of us have fantasized about. It delves into what freedom really entails and the dynamic complexity of friendships between women.\nOn writing, Lynn says \u201cleaving home is perhaps the central experience of the writer\u2019s life. The restless pursuit of a way back while remaining steadfastly at a distance \u2014 this is the enigma that informs the writer\u2019s perspective.\u201d By her own account she is neither fast nor disciplined as a writer. She says \u201cI\u2019m hard put to know which obsess me. The cult of the self? The self-promotion, selfies, self-this, self-that to which we\u2019re all subjected? Old age? Grown children?\u2026Something will come up, or nothing. If nothing, I\u2019ll try not to force something onto the page.\u201d The result is prose full of candor and wit that looks deeply at what it means to be a woman and what it means to be a writer.\nTo read more about Lynn Freed and her writing, check out this interview on The Rumpus.\nPlease join us for a thought-provoking evening with Lynn Freed this Thursday, November 1st at 7:30 pm in\u00a0Zingg Recital Hall (ARTS 150). Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, Writer\u2019s Voice readings are free and open to the public.\nWritten by Alyssa Cox\n\n \n\nOctober 29, 2018watershedcsuc CSUC, fiction, Lynn Freed, nonfiction, Writer's Voice Reading Series\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll\n\nDiscuss\nGet Inspired\nGet Polling\nGet Support\nLearn WordPress.com\nTheme Showcase\nWordPress Planet\nWordPress.com News\n\n\nTopics\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nUpcoming Events No upcoming events\nArchives\n\nMay 2022\nMarch 2022\nMay 2020\nOctober 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nOctober 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nApril 2017\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nDecember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nApril 2014\nFebruary 2014\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nAugust 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\n\n \n\nFollow me on TwitterMy Tweets \n\n\n\n\nCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
