The Cross-Cultural Center is a resource for all Chapman students to gain greater insights into their identities, develop a stronger sense of empathy for others\u2019 identities and use their learning to create a more positive and inclusive Chapman community.\nCuevas\u2019 biggest priorities are to support first-generation students and their families. Her responsibilities include coordinating and monitoring student meetings, study sessions and social events. Cuevas will also support DEI office student employees with professional development and act as a liaison between the Promising Futures Program and Cross-Cultural Center.\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer that there is a large cultural wealth that each student can bring,\u201d said Cuevas. \u201cI want to make sure that those students know the Cross-Cultural Center and First-Generation Program are resources available to them.\u201d\nCuevas has more than a decade of experience advocating for underrepresented student populations. Prior to joining Chapman, Cuevas was the academic coordinator for Harvey Mudd College, Upward Bound, where she developed and facilitated workshops about post-secondary education, professional development and the importance of mental health. Prior to that role, Cuevas was a student facilitator at Citrus Community College, College Connect Program, where she conducted one-on-one sessions offering academic and psychological support and developed individualized success plans.\n\u201cWhen I transitioned into my role at Chapman, I remembered how important it was to continue empowering our students,\u201d said Cuevas. \u201cI want to show our students that access, visibility and hard work does pay off. I\u2019m going to continue to advocate not only for students, but also for their families.\u201d\nOf the appointment, Vice President of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Reginald Chhen Stewart, Ph.D., said, \u201cAthina Cuevas brings an abundance of experience and dedication to serving first-generation students. I am confident she will play a pivotal role in continuing to advance Chapman\u2019s efforts to support our students.\u201d\n\u201cThere is a sense of hope in higher education,\u201d added Cuevas. \u201cSometimes higher education is not an option for first-generation folks because they must work right after high school. My position comes with a sense of privilege, and I\u2019ll do what I can to make sure I open doors and build bridges for our students and their families.\u201d\n\n\nAthina Cuevas Cross-Cultural Center Office of DEI Promising Futures Program \n\n\n\n\n \n\nPaul Pe \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Boasts First Two-Time Simon Scholars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Boasts First Two-Time Simon Scholars Miguel Lopez says his daughter \u201ccame home overjoyed\u201d 12 years ago after finding out that the Simon Family Foundation would pay for her college education. \u201cAnd today she came home even happier,\u201d he says in Spanish in a...\n\n\nApril 10, 2023 Joy Juedes\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily Bread: Donor Gift Supports Food Pantry at Chapman \n\nMarch 31, 2023 Rachel Morrison\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrinity Huynh \u201924, Advocates for Equity in Financial Aid with State Legislators As I roamed Chapman University\u2019s Orange campus, my eyes widened.
