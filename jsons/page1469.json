The\u00a0California\u00a0Promise Program (Senate Bill 412) enables Chico State to establish this pledge program which provides an opportunity for entering first-time students who are both interested and able to complete their baccalaureate degrees in four years. In addition, students who have been accepted with an Associate Degrees for Transfer (ADT) from a California Community College may complete their baccalaureate degrees in two years. The program is limited to students who are residents of California.California\u00a0Promise students will receive:Tailored academic advisingPriority course registration appointmentsGuaranteed graduation in four or two years depending on admission status\n                        Two Year Pledge\n                    \n                        Four Year Pledge\n                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility Help - If you need special accommodation to access any document on this page, please contact the Office of Accessible Technology (OATS) for assistance: Call OATS | Email OATS.Academic Advising ProgramsStudent Services Center, Room 220400 W.
