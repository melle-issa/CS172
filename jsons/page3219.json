Representatives at WordPress.com do not know why their access is currently blocked but are working to regain it.\n\nOur access to the Twitter API is currently blocked. As a result, Jetpack Social is temporarily unable to automatically share your posts directly from https://t.co/eRvNKWaolr to Twitter.  We have reached out to Twitter for more information on how to get unblocked.\u2014 WordPress.com (@wordpressdotcom) April 4, 2023\n\nThe API enables features like Jetpack Social\u2019s Twitter connection. Users who rely on this Jetpack module to auto-tweet their published posts will see errors in the dashboard until this issue is resolved. \n\nWordPress.com advised that reconnecting will not work at this time, nor will trying to establish a new connection. Connections to other social networks are still operational.\nOn large publishing sites some authors may not be aware that the auto-tweet functionality is broken. For the time being, the solution is to manually tweet published posts. \nJetpack users reported the issue in the plugin\u2019s support forums 10 hours ago, as some of them are Jetpack Social paid subscribers. In October 2022, Jetpack announced a paid plan for its Social plugin and limited the free version to 30 social shares per month, a controversial monetization decision that left many users in search of alternatives.\nSeveral users asked if refunds will be coming their way if the fix for the issue is not forthcoming, as auto-sharing to Facebook and Twitter is one of the main reasons customers subscribe to the service.\n\u201cWe are aware of issue and are looking into it with Twitter, but at this stage we don\u2019t know when it will be fixed,\u201d a Jetpack support representative responded to customers. \u201cWe\u2019re working with Twitter to find the best solution possible.\u201d\nTwitter launched its new API access tiers on March 29, 2023. Access to the Enterprise tier requires an application process. Over the next 30 days Twitter is deprecating its previous access tiers and is encouraging developers to migrate to the new tiers as soon as possible to avoid disruption.\nCategory: News, PluginsTags: jetpack, twitterShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Like thisLike Loading\u2026\n\n20\n\n\n\n\t\t20 responses to \u201cTwitter Suspends WordPress.com\u2019s Access to Twitter API, Breaking Jetpack Social Sharing\u201d\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sally G. says: \n\nApril 4, 2023 at 3:57 PM \n\n\nMusk is a disaster.

Is this really a surprise?  I know I was concerned about the impact this might have on \u201csocial walls.\u201d\nI also remembering thinking what?

If API access is valuable enough for people to pay Jetpack some piece of $120-$180/year for it, why shouldn\u2019t Twitter monetize it a bit too? Seems like a reasonable business decision. Or at least a defensible one.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Sally G. says: \n\nApril 4, 2023 at 8:19 PM \n\n\nFair point.  I don\u2019t pay for either, and if the free Twitter feed goes away, so be it\u2014I go looking for what I want as a reader, and my groups are small enough that we have neither budget nor interest in ongoing payments.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Tricia Francis says: \n\nApril 4, 2023 at 8:53 PM \n\n\nI\u2019d say Jetpack was charging for their ability to integrate Twitter\u2019s API into their offering and make it work for website owners and/or developers.  Most people wouldn\u2019t know what to do with the free API.\nAnd I tend to think that the resulting posts, traffic and interaction resulting from tools like Jetpack\u2019s would help Twitter \u2013 not take anything away from them.\nMy point was more like\u2026. Jetpack didn\u2019t see this coming?\nThat being said, even devs willing to pay were cut off. https://mashable.com/article/twitter-cuts-off-api-access-apps\nApparently there\u2019s a LOT of buzz about this \u2013 and @TwitterDev is trying to do damage control \u2013 including promoting new Twitter API Free or Basic plans.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Iain says: \n\nApril 5, 2023 at 7:27 AM \n\n\nJetpack can be used for free and the free version allows connection to twitter so no they were not charging for access to twitter\u2019s api while getting it for free. Twitter however was getting a lot of free content from WordPress users.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Chris David Miles says: \n\nApril 4, 2023 at 8:47 PM \n\n\nUpdate: It works again. https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/04/04/twitter-functionality-is-restored/\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Sally G. says: \n\nApril 4, 2023 at 8:53 PM \n\n\nBullies press to see how far they can go; enough push-back, and they back down.\nAutomattic must have come to terms with Twitter?  Or the negative press was not worth it?  Most important, the folks who run small wordpress.com sites will not be shut out\u2014at least not now.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Rachel says: \n\nApril 4, 2023 at 11:29 PM \n\n\nTwitter is so amazing. How do they do it? You type in some text and someone else can read it. I\u2019m really into celebrities, so I\u2019m hoping, one day they\u2019ll retweet one of my tweets and I\u2019ll be famous too.\nElon Musk is a genius. He invented electric cars, Twitter, flamethrowers and rockets. Where would we be without him? Elon in 2024. All the way. Replace the interstate highway system with hyperloop when Teslas (and pigs) fly.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Miroslav Glavi\u0107 says: \n\nApril 5, 2023 at 3:24 PM \n\n\nSo people can\u2019t click a share button? When your post gets published, hit the share button. You don\u2019t need an automatic thing.\nThings cost money, running Twitter/Instagram/Facebook/WordPress/etc\u2026 costs money to run. Yeah, let\u2019s blame Musk, the end of the world is here. Let\u2019s all move to Mastodon.\nAll the instances of Mastodon, I can\u2019t remember seeing any advertising. There are three ways to fund things: (1) ask for donations (2) advertising (3) charge for a pro version. Most wp plugins do 3 by the way.\nYoast SEO does pro, others do freemius thing.\nAdvertising has gone down for years. Most people won\u2019t even donate.\nYou do not need JetPack publishing, I personally don\u2019t use it. I use WP to Twitter. I am debating removing it from my sites.\nTwitter is a private company now and can set their own rules. Musk is not a bully.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Ciprian Popescu says: \n\nApril 5, 2023 at 4:30 PM \n\n\n100% my thoughts, exactly.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Sally G. says: \n\nApril 5, 2023 at 10:12 PM \n\n\nAgreed; I don\u2019t pay for any of these automatic services, my groups\u2019 budgets do not allow for much if any of that.  I have noticed, however, that clicking the Twitter share button on certain articles does not actually work; upon logging into Twitter, the usual box with link to share does not pop up, rather, I have to copy and paste the URL.  It is not on every site, and it started after Musk took over.  It could be sites deleting their Twitter account or choosing not to link actively, or it could be a limit from Twitter itself;  I\u2019m not sure, I just find it confusing and minorly annoying.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Joseph says: \n\nApril 5, 2023 at 4:02 PM \n\n\nAs someone said on Reddit. \u201cnothing of value is lost.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know if this is unexpected they\u2019ve been breaking their API and putting up paywalls after Musk bought it. \ud83d\ude02\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n SME says: \n\nApril 7, 2023 at 5:19 AM \n\n\nI noticed my post wasn\u2019t automatically shared on Twitter yesterday. Infact, the Twitter connect was also broken. But I was able to share the post with my Twitter readers manually using the social shares.\nWhile this could be a glitch, since no announcement was made, the new Twitter boss can do anything anytime so it could also be possible the block was from Twitter. And as always, they owe no apology to any of us.\nEither ways, Twitter could be loosing traffic somehow if they continue this way.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Tony Payne says: \n\nApril 15, 2023 at 11:12 AM \n\n\nGot notifications today that my Twitter Apps which were setup for the WP Twitter Auto Publish plugin have been suspended.\nThe details from Twitter are very confusing and trying to create new Apps and Projects through the Twitter Developer Dashboard is doing my head in.\nThink I\u2019m going to wait and see what happens as right now trying to figure out how to fix things is doing my head in.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Marcus Tibesar says: \n\nApril 24, 2023 at 8:43 PM \n\n\nSeems like my JetPack social connection to Facebook no longer works as well (although it is connected).
