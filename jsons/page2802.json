This fee increase was initially implemented by the CSU Board of Trustees on 11/16/11 and later rescinded at the 9/18/12 BOT meeting contingent upon the passage of Prop 30 . Spring 2013 tuition fees have thus been rolled back to 2011/12 levels. The commensurate percentage increase in the Professional Program Fee has also been rescinded.\u00a0\nThe CSU makes every effort to keep student costs to a minimum. Fees listed in published schedules or student accounts may need to be increased when public funding is inadequate. Therefore, CSU must reserve the right, even after initial fee payments are made, to increase or modify any listed fee, without notice, until the date when instruction for a particular semester or quarter has begun. All CSU listed fees should be regarded as estimates that are subject to change upon approval by The Board of Trustees.\n** 2.7% Campus-based Fees increase in 13-14 per the calculated Greater Bay Area CPI for the 2012 calendar year. Methodology for annual adjustment approved by student referendum in April 2001. It also reflects the implementation of the Student Center Fee ($150 per semester added to the Student Union Fee), beginning Fall 2013 as a result of the approved student fee referendum for the new Student Center.\nPer Executive Order No. 1042, beginning in fall 2010, for each adjustment made by trustee action to the State University Fee for graduate students, an equal adjustment will be made to the graduate professional business Category I fee.\u00a0\nTerm \"Tuition Fee\" used in place of \"State University Fee\" following approval at 11/10/10 CSU BOT and guidelines in CSU Executive Order 1054.\n\nAdditional Fees:\nNon-residential Tuition Fee (per unit): $372. (See\u00a0admissions/residency for determination of residence for nonresident tuition purposes.)\nProfessional Program Fee (MBA) (per unit): $254.
