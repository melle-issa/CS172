From career growth opportunities and workplace flexibility to our tuition reimbursement program, hear how Brown has impacted these staff members.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBrown University gives opportunity, not just for me, but for my family and my community.\u201d\n\u2014 Kennedy Arias\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d be in finance and doing what I\u2019m doing today, and I have Brown to thank for that.\u201d\n\u2014 Tina Trahan\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a single mom, Brown has provided me the flexibility and support to be able to work to my fullest potential, all while still feeling like I can be the mom I\u2019d like to be.\u201d\n\u2014 Linda Angela\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBrown gives you opportunities to grow and expand beyond what you ever imagined yourself doing.\u201d\n\u2014 John Colarusso\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBuilding Futures helps you understand that if you apply yourself, opportunity is endless, and Brown\u2019s going to turn around and make sure you have work to do for the next 30 years.\u201d\n\u2014 Andre Gatlin (Building Futures)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Brown?\nBrown University is a leading research university distinct for its student-centered learning and deep sense of purpose. Our students, faculty and staff are driven by the idea that their work will have an impact in the world.\nA commitment to academic excellence, intellectual freedom and making an impact to better serve people, communities and society is at the center of everything we do. This commitment is brought to life each and every day by the work of faculty and staff across a wide range of Brown schools, departments, offices, centers, programs and initiatives.\n\n\nProvidence\nFor more than two and a half centuries, Brown has been deeply connected to the diverse and vibrant city of Providence \u2014 as a neighbor, employer and institution dedicated to a mission of education, research and service.\n\n\nLife at Brown\nWe are a community guided by shared values, unyielding dedication to diversity, equity and inclusion, and a fundamental commitment to supporting one another.\n\n\nImpact\nOur faculty and staff are uncommonly driven by the idea that their work will have an impact \u2014 locally and throughout the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I was in the Marine Corps, it felt like a family because you go through so many things together, and you build this special bond. Now that I\u2019m at Brown, I feel that here, too.\u201d\nJuana De Los Santos Assistant Vice President of Equal Opportunity and Diversity\n\n\u201cMy work is very meaningful to me. I\u2019m honored to be part of the team that one day will eradicate malaria. It\u2019s the best opportunity I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\nSunthorn Pond-Tor Laboratory Manager, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine\n\n\u201cAt Brown, they want staff to grow, and your supervisor is going to help you get to that next step in your career.\u201d\nPatricia Vescera Operations and Students Affairs Manager, the Warren Alpert Medical School \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always considered myself a loyal employee that works hard to add value to the company. It feels good to have the opposite be true, where the organization is investing in you too.\u201d\nEthan Hebert Manager of Admissions & Enrollment Services, Division of Pre-College and Undergraduate Programs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating Jobs through Partnership\nBrown has a longstanding partnership with Building Futures, a Providence nonprofit that allows Rhode Islanders from all backgrounds to learn the fundamentals of a wide variety of construction trades without paying tuition or incurring debt. In the 15 years between 2007 and 2022, 355 apprentices hired by Building Futures have logged hundreds of thousands of labor hours across 25 different construction projects at Brown.\nRead more about Building Futures\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBrown has impacted so many people\u2019s lives and brought them into the middle class, not just by creating jobs, but by building careers.\u201d\n\u2014 Michael F. Sabitoni, President, RI Building Trades\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how important this campus has been in getting our men and women to work daily to make a decent middle-class living. We\u2019re forever appreciative of it and see Brown as a real economic element in the City of Providence and the State of Rhode Island.\u201d\n\u2014 Scott Duhamel Rhode Island Building Trades and Construction Council\n\n\u201cI cannot overstate the impact that our partnership with Brown has had not only for Building Futures graduates, but across the state. It means that 355 people who were experiencing poverty now have a middle-class life.\u201d\n\u2014 Andrew Cort\u00e9s Executive director of Building Futures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity, Reporting Procedures and Annual Security Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvidence\nRI\n02912\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n401-863-1000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Navigation\n\n\n\n\nVisit Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA to Z\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter Navigation\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareers at Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe campaign for building on distinction\n\nGive To Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Navigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapchat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Media Directory\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Brown University \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown University\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFor You\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Students\n\n\nFaculty\n\n\nStaff\n\n\nParents & Families\n\n\nAlumni\n\n\nFriends & Neighbors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMenu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Site Navigation\n\n\n\n\nMobile Site Navigation\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate\n\n\n\n\nGraduate & Professional\n\n\n\n\nSchools & Colleges\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Departments\n\n\n\n\nCenters & Institutes\n\n\n\n\nLibraries & Collections\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Education\n\n\n\n\nNon-Degree Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmission & Aid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate Admission\n\n\n\n\nGraduate Admission\n\n\n\n\nMedical School Admission\n\n\n\n\nExecutive & Professional Admission\n\n\n\n\nTuition & Aid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind a Researcher\n\n\n\n\nIndustry Engagement\n\n\n\n\nConducting Research at Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLife at Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthletics & Recreation\n\n\n\n\nCommunity\n\n\n\n\nHealth & Wellness\n\n\n\n\nHousing & Dining\n\n\n\n\nLife in Providence\n\n\n\n\nStudent Organizations\n\n\n\n\nUniversity Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Events\n\n\n\n\nFor Journalists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobile Secondary Navigation Navigation\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Info\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\nFor You\n\n\n\n\nGive to Brown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of Brown.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping Careers, Leading Lives of Purpose\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen details for Developing Careers, Leading Lives of Purpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookmark this Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
