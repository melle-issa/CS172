Mondays 1pm-2pm,and Thursdays 3pm-4pm. Feel free to drop into the Zoom (must be logged into your SDSU account), no appointment needed! See link for current\n                                          hours and Zoom link. Feel free to drop in to discuss diversity planning, equity-minded\n                                          hiring, inclusive and anti-oppressive pedagogy, or anything else! Note that the first\n                                          two sessions each month will be focused on practicing responding to microaggressions;\n                                          however, a member of the team will be available to discuss individual questions as\n                                          well.\n\n\n\n\nImplicit Bias Training\n\n\n\nCreating an Equity-Minded Campus Community\u00a0 (previously\u00a0Equity, Implicit Bias and Microaggressions)\nAt San Diego State, social justice and a sense of belonging for all members of our\n                                             community are important institutional values, and we strive to integrate equity and\n                                             inclusion in everything we do. Creating this kind of community requires a shared understanding\n                                             among all faculty and staff of foundational vocabulary and concepts such as implicit\n                                             bias, microaggressions, equity-mindedness and inclusive communication. This course\n                                             introduces these concepts to faculty and staff to support more informed conversations\n                                             about inequities and social justice issues across the campus. It serves as a prerequisite\n                                             for a number of other programs and is offered as an online self-paced workshop on\n                                             Canvas. You can enroll at any point during the semester. If you go straight through\n                                             the content, it should take about 2-2.5 hours (120-180 min) to complete the 5 modules.\nThis workshop is for Faculty and Staff at SDSU. At this point, we are not able to\n                                             offer this workshop to other members of the SDSU community including graduate or undergraduate\n                                             students. Students are encouraged to check out the offerings of the Student Diversity Officer. If you are an SDSU faculty or staff and are ready to start the workshop, please\n                                             register here.\u00a0\n* NOTE: This is the training that satisfies the requirement many departments have\n                                             for search committees. Faculty who have already completed this workshop can also satisfy\n                                             the requirement with one of the workshops on Equity-Minded Hiring\n\n\n\n\n\nReports and Information\n\n\n\n\nCIE Annual Report 2021-22\nFaculty and Staff Diversity Annual Report 2021-22\nCIE Annual Report 2020-21\nFaculty and Staff Diversity Annual Report 2020-21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent\u00a0Engagement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity-Minded Hiring\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJEDI\u00a0 Toolkit\n\n\nFaculty and Staff Resource Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CIE logo is based on a symbol used throughout Mesoamerica by the Nahua, Mixtec, and other Indigenous people to\n                                    indicate \"noble speech\".
