Sonoma State University is excited to announce Seawolf Bundle, a new learning material delivery program that provides access to your required learning materials in a convenient package before the first day of class. Undergraduate\u00a0and graduate students\u00a0will have the ability to bundle the cost of learning materials into their tuition.\u00a0\nLearning materials are\u00a0the content or information conveyed within a course and these include the textbooks, readers, multimedia components, and other resources in a course. This is primarily a rental program. Students can choose to purchase the textbook or learning material for a nominal additional fee.\nThe Seawolf Bundle program will cost a low, flat fee of $18.50 per credit hour.\u00a0The Seawolf Bundle will cost\u00a0$277.50 per semester for 15 credit hours. For the traditional model,\u00a0financial aid factors $497 per semester for learning materials. The Seawolf Bundle provides equitable access to learning materials for students.\u00a0\nThis program will begin in the Fall 2023 semester.\u00a0\n\nUniversity Store Seawolf Bundle | Sonoma State University\n\n\nVideo of University Store Seawolf Bundle | Sonoma State University\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeawolf Bundle\n\nSeawolf Bundle Home\nAbout\nStudent Information\nFaculty Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    How It Works  \n\n\n\n\n\nRegister for Class\nAll students will be\u00a0automatically\u00a0enrolled in the program.
