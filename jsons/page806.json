As such, information technology resources, services and programs will be made accessible to persons with disabilities.\u00a0\nOur goal is that all campus websites meet the World Wide Web Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0 AA). This effort represents a shared responsibility of all members of the campus and will require ongoing, overall institutional attention and commitment for its success. We are utilizing SiteImprove for regular, automated accessibility reports, as well as performing regular, manual scans of campus websites.\nSubmit a Ticket\nIf you have Accessibility questions, or need a document or website reviewed and/or remediated for Accessibility, please submit an IT Helpdesk Ticket.\nAccessible Technology Initiative\nThe Accessible Technology Initiative (ATI) is the CSU commitment to providing access to information resources and technologies for students and the university's public with disabilities (physical, sensory, cognitive, learning).\nATI serves as a roadmap for ensuring accessibility based on state and federal law. SSU supports the idea of an equitable environment for all diverse students, employees and others who interact with us.\nEnsuring the accessibility of information technology and resources is a shared responsibility that cuts across the campus and requires ongoing, overall institutional attention and commitment for its success. One of the common requirements in the ATI plan is the identification of roles and responsibilities for each aspect of accessibility.\nAchieving accessibility will require collaboration among faculty, Disabled Student Services, bookstore, academic and student services departments, Information Technology, other institutional staff, and students with disabilities.\nContact\nBrad Starkey-Owens\nAccessibility Services Analyststarkeyowe@sonoma.edu\u00a0\u2022 ext. 43216\u00a0\u2022 Schulz 1063\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\nAccessibility Home\nAccessible Technology Initiative\nWeb\nInstructional Materials\nProcurement\nContact/Report an Accessibility Problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessible Syllabus Template \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nYoutube\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Ave\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n707.664.2880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact SSU\nPrivacy Notice\nCalifornia State University\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSafeSSU\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\nEmergency Information\nJobs\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
