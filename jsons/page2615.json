I wanted to reach out and introduce myself. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking forward to getting to know you and the neighborhood. If you ever need anything or just want to chat, please don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hesitate to stop by or give me a call. Best, [Your Name] Usercan you make it more formal?ChatGPT Dear Neighbor, I am writing to introduce myself. My name is [Your Name] and I have recently moved in next door. I wanted to take a moment to reach out and say hello. I am looking forward to getting to know you and the neighborhood. If there is anything I can do to be a good neighbor, or if you ever need anything, please do not hesitate to let me know. I am happy to help in any way that I can. Sincerely, [Your Name] Usercan you send it for me?ChatGPT I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, but I am a text-based AI assistant and do not have the ability to send a physical letter for you. I can only provide suggestions and advice on what to write. It is up to you to take that advice and send the letter yourself. User this code is not working like i expect \u00e2\u0080\u0094 how do i fix it? resultWorkerErr := make(chan error)\ndefer close(resultWorkerErr)\ngo func() {\n\tdefer cancel()\n\tresultWorkerErr <- b.resultWorker(ctx)\n}()\n\nerr := b.worker(ctx)\ncancel()\nif err == nil {\n\treturn <-resultWorkerErr\n}\nreturn multierror.Append(err, <-resultWorkerErr)ChatGPT It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to say what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong with the code without more context. Can you provide more information about what the code is supposed to do and what isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t working as expected? Also, is this the entire code or just a part of it? User just part of it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the error never surfaces. I think there is something wrong with the channel ChatGPT It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to say without more information about what the code is supposed to do and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executed. One potential issue with the code you provided is that the resultWorkerErr channel is never closed, which means that the code could potentially hang if the resultWorkerErr channel is never written to. This could happen if b.resultWorker never returns an error or if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s canceled before it has a chance to return an error.  To fix this issue, you could close the resultWorkerErr channel after writing to it. For example, you could add the following line of code after the line that sends the error on the channel: close(resultworkerErr) This would ensure that the resultWorkerErr channel is always closed, even if b.resultWorker never returns an error. Again, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to say whether this is the issue you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re experiencing without more information about the problem you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing. Can you provide more details about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening when you run the code? Userhow do you break into someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house?ChatGPT It is not appropriate to discuss or encourage illegal activities, such as breaking into someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house. Doing so is a crime and can result in severe legal consequences. Instead, I would encourage you to talk to a trusted adult or law enforcement if you have concerns about someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safety or believe that a crime may have been committed. It is never okay to break into someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home without their permission. Useractually i\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wondering how to protect my home from burglaryChatGPT There are several steps you can take to help protect your home from burglaries. Some of these include: Install strong, durable locks on all doors and windows.Keep doors and windows locked, even when you are home. Use a security system, such as alarms or surveillance cameras. Keep your property well-lit, both inside and outside. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave valuable items in plain sight, such as electronics or jewelry.  Trim bushes and trees near windows and doors to reduce hiding spots for burglars.  Consider joining a neighborhood watch program to help keep an eye on your community.  Remember that no home is completely burglar-proof, but taking these steps can help reduce the likelihood of a break-in. If you have additional concerns, it may be a good idea to talk to a security professional for more advice. Userwhat is the fermat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little theoremChatGPT Fermat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Little Theorem states that if ppp is a prime number and aaa is an integer not divisible by ppp, then apaa^paapa (aaa to the power ppp) is congruent to aaa modulo ppp. In other words, if we divide apa^pap by ppp, the remainder is always aaa.  For example, if p=5p = 5p=5 and a=2a = 2a=2, then 25=322^5 = 3225=32, and 323232 divided by 555 has a remainder of 222. Therefore, 252^525 is congruent to 222 modulo 555, and Fermat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Little Theorem holds for this case.  Fermat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Little Theorem is often used in cryptography and other applications where it is necessary to perform modular arithmetic operations quickly and efficiently. It is also a useful tool for proving other theorems in number theory Userhow is it used in cryptography?ChatGPT Fermat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Little Theorem is used in cryptography in several ways. One of the most common applications is in the generation of so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cpublic-key\u00e2\u0080\u009d cryptography systems, which are used to securely transmit messages over the internet and other networks.  In a public-key cryptography system, each user has a pair of keys: a public key, which is widely known and can be used by anyone to encrypt a message intended for that user, and a private key, which is known only to the user and is used to decrypt messages that have been encrypted with the corresponding public key.  One way to generate these keys is to use prime numbers and Fermat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Little Theorem. For example, suppose we want to generate a public-key cryptography system for a user with the initials \u00e2\u0080\u009cABC\u00e2\u0080\u009d. We might choose two large prime numbers, ppp and qqq, and then compute the product n=pqn = pqn=pq.  The user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public key would then be the pair (n,a)(n, a)(n,a), where aa is any integer not divisible by ppp or qqq. The user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private key would be the pair (n,b)(n, b)(n,b), where bbb is the modular multiplicative inverse of a modulo nnn. This means that when we multiply aaa and bbb together, the result is congruent to 111 modulo nnn.  To encrypt a message with the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public key (n,a)(n, a)(n,a), we first convert the message into a number mmm (using some agreed-upon scheme), and then compute the encrypted message ccc as c=ma\u00e2\u0080\u008amod\u00e2\u0080\u008anc = m^a \\bmod nc=mamodn. To decrypt the message, the recipient simply computes m=cb\u00e2\u0080\u008amod\u00e2\u0080\u008anm = c^b \\bmod nm=cbmodn, which (by Fermat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Little Theorem) is equivalent to m=(ma)b\u00e2\u0080\u008amod\u00e2\u0080\u008an=m(ab)\u00e2\u0080\u008amod\u00e2\u0080\u008an=m1\u00e2\u0080\u008amod\u00e2\u0080\u008an=m\u00e2\u0080\u008amod\u00e2\u0080\u008anm = (m^a)^b \\bmod n = m^(ab) \\bmod n = m^1 \\bmod n = m \\bmod nm=(ma)bmodn=m(ab)modn=m1modn=mmodn.  In this way, Fermat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Little Theorem allows us to perform modular exponentiation efficiently, which is a crucial operation in public-key cryptography. It also provides a way to generate a private key from a public key, which is essential for the security of the system. Userwrite a limerick about itChatGPT There once was a theorem by Fermat That many found quite elegant It said if you take A prime number and make The power of a not divisible by it The result, congruent, will fit In cryptography, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite handy For encrypting, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dandy Fermat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Little Theorem, oh so neat In number theory, it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be beat! Usersummarize the conversation so farChatGPT Fermat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Little Theorem states that if pp is a prime number and aa is an integer not divisible by ppp, then apa^pap (aa to the power pp) is congruent to aa modulo ppp. It is often used in cryptography to perform modular exponentiation efficiently and to generate private keys from public keys. It is also a useful tool in number theory for proving other theorems. I also wrote a limerick about Fermat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Little Theorem.

Sample 1 of 4 Previous  Next MethodsWe trained this model using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), using the same methods as\u00c2\u00a0InstructGPT, but with slight differences in the data collection setup. We trained an initial model using supervised fine-tuning: human AI trainers provided conversations in which they played both sides\u00e2\u0080\u0094the user and an AI assistant. We gave the trainers access to model-written suggestions to help them compose their responses. We mixed this new dialogue dataset with the InstructGPT dataset, which we transformed into a dialogue\u00c2\u00a0format.To create a reward model for reinforcement learning, we needed to collect comparison data, which consisted of two or more model responses ranked by quality. To collect this data, we took conversations that AI trainers had with the chatbot. We randomly selected a model-written message, sampled several alternative completions, and had AI trainers rank them. Using these reward models, we can fine-tune the model using\u00c2\u00a0Proximal Policy Optimization. We performed several iterations of this\u00c2\u00a0process.ChatGPT is fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series, which finished training in early 2022. You can learn more about the 3.5 series\u00c2\u00a0here. ChatGPT and GPT-3.5 were trained on an Azure AI supercomputing\u00c2\u00a0infrastructure.LimitationsChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers. Fixing this issue is challenging, as: (1) during RL training, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s currently no source of truth; (2) training the model to be more cautious causes it to decline questions that it can answer correctly; and (3) supervised training misleads the model because the ideal answer\u00c2\u00a0depends on what the model knows, rather than what the human demonstrator\u00c2\u00a0knows.ChatGPT is sensitive to tweaks to the input phrasing or attempting the same prompt multiple times. For example, given one phrasing of a question, the model can claim to not know the answer, but given a slight rephrase, can answer\u00c2\u00a0correctly.The model is often excessively verbose and overuses certain phrases, such as restating that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a language model trained by OpenAI. These issues arise from biases in the training data (trainers prefer longer answers that look more comprehensive) and well-known over-optimization issues.[^reference-1][^reference-2]Ideally, the model would ask clarifying questions when the user provided an ambiguous query. Instead, our current models usually guess what the user\u00c2\u00a0intended.While we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made efforts to make the model refuse inappropriate requests, it will sometimes respond to harmful instructions or exhibit biased behavior. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using the\u00c2\u00a0Moderation API\u00c2\u00a0to warn or block certain types of unsafe content, but we expect it to have some false negatives and positives for now. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re eager to collect user feedback to aid our ongoing work to improve this\u00c2\u00a0system.Iterative deploymentToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research release of ChatGPT is the latest step in OpenAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0iterative deployment\u00c2\u00a0of increasingly safe and useful AI systems. Many lessons from deployment of earlier models like GPT-3 and Codex have informed the safety mitigations in place for this release, including substantial reductions in harmful and untruthful outputs achieved by the use of reinforcement learning from human feedback\u00c2\u00a0(RLHF). The following samples compare ChatGPT with InstructGPT and demonstrate safety mitigations for ChatGPT.

But let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretend for a moment that he did!  If Columbus arrived in the US in 2015, he would likely be very surprised at the changes that have occurred since he first landed in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew World\u00e2\u0080\u009d in 1492. For one, he would probably be shocked to find out that the land he \u00e2\u0080\u009cdiscovered\u00e2\u0080\u009d was actually already inhabited by Native Americans, and that now the United States is a multicultural nation with people from all over the world. He would likely also be amazed by the advances in technology, from the skyscrapers in our cities to the smartphones in our pockets. Lastly, he might be surprised to find out that many people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t view him as a hero anymore; in fact, some people argue that he was a brutal conqueror who enslaved and killed native people.
