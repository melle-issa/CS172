Planning\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion Planning\nA University Senate resolution approved on Feb. 6, 2018, requires all units to engage\n                              in diversity planning. It stated:\n\u201cLET IT BE RESOLVED, that San Diego State University creates a campus-wide diversity\n                              plan and that all academic and administrative units/divisions also create individual\n                              diversity plans that are congruent with the University plan. The University shall\n                              provide training and support for developing these plans. This requirement shall be\n                              in place by the year 2020.\u201d\nAll colleges, divisions and auxiliaries spent the 2019-20 year developing their plans; individual schools and departments will now pick up that work to develop their own plans during 2020-21. In a message sent on Juneteenth 2020, the academic leadership pledged to ensure that college diversity plans are publicly\n                              shared. Please see the links below for more information about each unit's plan:\u00a0\n\nCollege of Arts and Letters\nFowler College of Business\nCollege of Education\nCollege of Engineering\nCollege of Health and Human Services\nCollege of Professional Studies and Fine Arts\nCollege of Sciences\nLibrary\nImperial Valley\nGlobal Campus\nBusiness and Financial Affairs\nInformation Technology\nResearch and Innovation\nStudent Affairs and Campus Diversity\nUniversity Relations and Development\nAssociated Students\nAztec Shops\nResearch Foundation\n\nLooking for information to guide the college or department planning process?

It stated:\n\u201cLET IT BE RESOLVED, that San Diego State University creates a campus-wide diversity\n                                          plan and that all academic and administrative units/divisions also create individual\n                                          diversity plans that are congruent with the University plan. The University shall\n                                          provide training and support for developing these plans. This requirement shall be\n                                          in place by the year 2020.\u201d\nAfter receiving the resolution, President Roush supported the implementation of the\n                                          resolution and further provided that all units have diversity plans by fall 2020.\n                                          Any units without an approved plan will not be able to hire beginning Jan. 1, 2021,\n                                          until the criteria are satisfied. The Diversity and Inclusion Plans are meant to be\n                                          expansive in nature; according to the resolution language, \u201call academic and administrative\n                                          units/divisions\u201d are required to have a plan on file. Beyond the wider university\n                                          plan for equity, diversity, and inclusion, this includes all 54 academic departments\n                                          and schools, eight colleges, Library, Imperial Valley Campus, Mission Valley Campus,\u00a0all\n                                          divisions (Academic Affairs, Business and Financial Affairs, Graduate and Research\n                                          Affairs, Information Technology, Student Affairs, University Relations and Development),\n                                          and campus auxiliaries. However, to ensure vertical alignment between the College\n                                          Diversity Plans and the Department/School Diversity Plans, in September 2019, DDI\n                                          recommended to the University Senate that the deadline for the Department/School Plans\n                                          be moved to March of 2021; that recommendation was approved at the October 1 Senate\n                                          meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose of Diversity Planning\n\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion Plans are an opportunity for units to articulate their goals\n                                          with respect to equity, diversity and inclusion for all faculty, staff and students\n                                          as part of their mission of excellence in education and scholarship.\u00a0A good plan requires\n                                          understanding how well the unit is (or isn\u2019t) currently supporting students, staff\n                                          and faculty from diverse backgrounds; developing a shared vision of the environment\n                                          that the unit wishes to create; and considering metrics for evaluating progress toward\n                                          shared goals. The process of creating these plans is\u00a0therefore an opportunity for\n                                          units to engage in important conversations about values and priorities, and to think\n                                          strategically about what changes are needed to reach stated goals. At the end of the\n                                          development progress, these plans will help guide the unit as changes are implemented\n                                          and progress is evaluated; at the same time, plans themselves will continue to evolve\n                                          as departments and units continue to grow and develop.\nTo support the development of these plans, Campus Diversity and the Diversity Liaisons\n                                          (the\u00a0Equity\u00a0and\u00a0Inclusion\u00a0Councils) provides guidance, professional learning, and continued support with individual\n                                          elements of the plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nReview and Approval\n\n\nOnce submitted, plans follow a multi-step process, including:\n                                       \n                                       \nInformal feedback and review from the College/Unit-level Diversity and Inclusion councils\nInformal feedback and review from the University Inclusion and Equity Council representatives\nReview and recommendation for approval from the Senate DEI committee\nReview and approval from the Chief Diversity Officer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation for Schools/Departments\n\n\n\nThe process and expectations for individual schools and departments are somewhat different\n                                             than for the colleges.\u00a0For more information on that process, please see the page on\n                                             Diversity and Inclusion Planning for Schools
