UCI Libraries\n\nA fiery plane crash, an aspiring opera singer and a rusty pair of scissors. Those are three of the ingredients behind an exhibit that toasts the 400th anniversary of a rare Shakespeare anthology owned by UCI.\nDebuting May 4 at Langson Library and continuing through December, \u201c400 Years of Shakespeare\u2019s First Folio\u201d features 90 artifacts related to the Bard, ranging from a 17th century witchcraft book regarded as \u201cone of the most comprehensive works on the subject of evil spirits, the devil and wizards\u201d to a Morse code version of two Shakespearean sonnets created in 2015.\nNearly every decade over the last five centuries is represented by at least one exhibit item, says curator Derek Christian Quezada Meneses.\nThis 1604 anatomy book represents the growing knowledge of the human body during Shakespeare\u2019s time. UCI Libraries\nNormally locked in a vault, UCI\u2019s folio \u2013 a first-edition book of Shakespeare\u2019s plays \u2013 was donated to the campus in 1986 by alumnus Patrick Hanratty, a computer scientist, inventor and entrepreneur who paid $241,000 for the volume in 1983.\nIn media interviews, Hanratty \u2013 who died in 2019 \u2013 explained the twists of fate that led to the gift. A longtime Bard fan whose parents worked on Shakespeare productions at San Diego\u2019s Old Globe Theatre, Hanratty originally planned to be a professional opera singer. But while serving in the Korean War as a gunner in the Air Force, he was in a B-29 bomber crash that left his lungs and vocal cords scarred by chemical fumes.\nSo, instead of arias, he turned to arithmetic and computers, and struck it rich as the father of computer-aided design and manufacturing, aka CAD/CAM. In 1977, he earned a Ph.D. in computer science at UCI.\nHanratty\u2019s multimillion dollar career detour enabled him to begin collecting rare books, capped by the 900-page First Folio now at UCI. Published in 1623, seven years after Shakespeare\u2019s death, it\u2019s one of 235 known copies still in existence.\nCharles and Mary Lamb\u2019s Tales from Shakespeare, first published in the early 1800s, was tailored to children and young adults with lavish illustrations. UCI Libraries\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to overestimate the importance of the First Folio,\u201d says UCI Shakespeare scholar Julia Lupton, Distinguished Professor of English. Without it, 18 of the Bard\u2019s plays \u2013 including such favorites as Macbeth and The Taming of the Shrew \u2013 would have been lost to history, she notes.\nThe tomes originally sold for 15 shillings each, equal to about $200 now. Today, they go for millions. In 1978, UCI\u2019s edition was purchased for $30,000 by a Los Angeles bookshop, then sold to Hanratty for eight times that amount in 1983, according to Eric Rasmussen, co-editor of The Shakespeare First Folios: A Descriptive Catalogue.\nEach folio has its own idiosyncrasies and backstory. \u201cThere\u2019s even one with a bullet hole through the middle,\u201d says Rasmussen, who will speak at the exhibit\u2019s opening night event in the Irvine Barclay Theatre.\nThe UCI version\u2019s quirks include rust marks from a pair of scissors \u2013 probably used as a bookmark \u2013 and a maroon leather cover from the late 1800s or early 1900s that was fashioned from the skin of a Nigerian goat.\nIn addition to the updated binding, three of the book\u2019s pages vanished at some point and were replaced with replicas, most likely in the 19th century.\nSuch substitutions are common, Rasmussen says. Only a handful of surviving First Folios are 100 percent original, he notes. Among the rest, about four dozen cannibalized other first editions to replace lost pages. And another 30 copies, including UCI\u2019s, are intact except for a few facsimile pages, Rasmussen says.\nPart of the reason Hanratty donated his folio to the university was its odor. Stored inside his private vault, \u201cit had begun to smell, and to smell very badly,\u201d he told the Los Angeles Times. He contemplated selling it, \u201cbut then I thought, well, I would like to see it again someday. I thought it would be better if it were available to everybody else, and to myself.\u201d\n(Thanks to UCI\u2019s temperature- and humidity-controlled vault in Special Collections and Archives, the foul fragrance is now gone, a library spokesperson says.)\nIn the decades since the folio came to UCI, campus librarians have amassed a trove of \u201ccompanion materials\u201d from rare book dealers, some of which will be displayed for the first time at the exhibit, which will be located in Langson Library\u2019s main lobby.\nThe catalog of artwork and artifacts being showcased includes an index of banned books from 1559, an anatomy guide from 1604 that features \u201cdetailed illustrations of the gradual removal of layers of human flesh via dissection,\u201d a Geneva Bible from 1600 (which Shakespeare quoted in Hamlet and other scripts) and a Latin book about Plautus, the ancient Roman playwright whose plots and characters were borrowed by the Bard for such works as The Comedy of Errors.\nThe goal is to explore Shakespeare\u2019s world, his muses and his influence on language, art and literature.\nCuriously, the one item that won\u2019t be included in UCI Libraries\u2019 First Folio exhibit \u2013 except on opening night \u2013 is the First Folio itself. For security reasons, the book is staying in the vault, says library spokesperson Cheryl Baltes. All the First Folio items in display cases will be detailed reproductions.\nUCI Libraries\u2019 \u201c400 Years of Shakespeare\u2019s First Folio\u201d begins Thursday at the Irvine Barclay Theatre with a 5:30 p.m. discussion between exhibit curator Derek Quezada, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the former outreach and public services librarian in UCI Libraries Special Collections and Archives who recently became rare books librarian at USC, and Shakespeare expert Eric Rasmussen, Regents Teaching Professor and Foundation Professor of English at the University of Nevada, Reno. The talk will be followed by a short performance from Macbeth, then move to Langson Library for a reception and exhibit viewing.\nTo learn more about supporting this or other activities at UCI, please visit the Brilliant Future website.
