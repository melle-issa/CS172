To accomplish this goal, Lewison and her team will leverage SDSU\u2019s inclusive, climate-focused initiatives, such as the\u00a0Community Climate Action Network and\u00a0the Center for Regional Sustainability\u00a0as well as partnerships with community-facing organizations, like the\u00a0Climate Science Alliance.\u00a0\u201cWe are grateful for the incredible trust and support of the EPA and Department of Energy, which will allow us to leverage SDSU\u2019s longstanding commitment to climate action and environmental justice,\u201d said SDSU President\u00a0Adela de la Torre.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAs the only California university selected to lead this work, this is clear recognition of our faculty\u2019s ability and passion to foster mutually beneficial relationships with tribal and other key communities. And this empowerment focus is exactly what makes SDSU distinct as a major research university \u2013 our focus is not just on the idea, but on creating a sustainable and positive impact.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Partner organizations span across industry and non-profit sectors including the Environmental Protection Network, Center for Creative Land Recycling, Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals, Desert Research Institute, Pacific RISA, and the Public Health Alliance.\u00a0Other academic institutions that will also participate are Arizona State University, the University of San Diego\u2019s Energy Policy Initiatives Center, and the University of Guam\u2019s Center of Island Sustainability.\u00a0\u201cSDSU has long been a central figure in regional, multi-partner projects, providing services, centering community-defined priorities and facilitating meaningful cooperative decision making,\u201d said\u00a0John Crockett, SDSU\u2019s associate vice president for research advancement. \u201cWe are ready to apply our expertise to this opportunity.\u201d\u00a0In addition to the $10 million from the federal government, SDSU has committed $100,000 to support the initial launch of the center.\u00a0The new center plans to establish its physical home at\u00a0SDSU Mission Valley\u2019s Innovation District, which is being designed to attract the nation\u2019s best-in-class researchers to support the district\u2019s many transdisciplinary hubs. These hubs will support private, public, and non-profit partners, including organizations focused on climate resilience and sustainability efforts, by cultivating rich, collaborative spaces that are easily accessible through public transit.\u00a0\u201cSDSU\u2019s Center for Community Energy and Environmental Justice aligns with the Innovation District\u2019s focus on sustainable development and community input as essential to finding solutions to the environmental and health problems created by climate change,\u201d said\u00a0Hala Madanat, SDSU\u2019s vice president for research and innovation. \u201cWe look forward to building an exemplary facility with environmental justice at its heart.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\nLatest Stories\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nBranching Out: How Math Can Help Better Understand DiseasesDistantly Related Tanagers Independently Evolve Similar BeaksSDSU at the San Diego Festival of Science and EngineeringVIDEO: The Benefits of SDSU Field TripsSDSU Biodiversity Museum Open House Celebrates 125 Years of CollectingStem Cell Research Internship Opened New Doors for SDSU AlumnaSDSU Program a Catalyst for Chemistry Student to Develop Skills and Identity as ScientistSDSU Physics Graduate Student Receives Teaching AwardSelf-Driving Cars: The Next Computing Revolution But Far From PerfectTracing the 12,000-Year Pedigree of BeerCaring for Late Father Inspires SDSU Alumnus to Improve Indigenous Cancer Health CareMauna Loa Eruption: Q&A with SDSU Geologist\n\n\nBROWSE ALL RELATED\n\n\n\n\nSeeman, Sato Named to All Mountain West TeamsSDSU Deepens Ties to OaxacaSDSU Wins Second Straight MW ChampionshipFour Aztecs Earn All-Mountain West HonorsSDSU's Class of 2023: Best Spots on Campus to Take Grad PhotosSDSU Imperial Valley Partnership Opens Doors to Higher Education for Foster YouthEducation Programs, Health Care Management Shine in New Graduate RankingsWater Polo: Legaspi and Valdes Earn GCC Postseason HonorsSDSU Educator Works to Improve Safety, Inclusion for LGBTQIA+ YouthAztec Baseball Collects Two MW Weekly HonorsEmployee Resource Group Sets Sights on a Broader ReachThe Road to SDSU\u2019s Senior Design Day 2023\n\n\nBROWSE ALL LATEST\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossing the Line\n\n\n                                                                \n                                                                Ongoing through Thursday, May 4, 2023, 4pm The San Diego State University School of Art and Design presents Crossing the Line at the University Art Gallery through Thursday, May 4, 2023.Crossing the Line features the artwork of 29 local artists, faculty, and alumni of the School of Art and Design, whose work examines the notion of boundaries and borders.
