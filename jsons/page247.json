Ollie is built to work seamlessly with the WordPress block editor and site editor, where you can create beautiful, fully-customizable websites with WordPress's built-in page builder \u2014 no page builder or coding skills required.\nOllie ships with over 50 beautifully-designed patterns, page templates, block styles, and style variations so you can design stunning pages quickly with drag and drop instead of code. Ollie is also blazing fast, fully customizable via the WordPress UI, fully responsive out of the box, and scores 100% across the board on performance.\nMy goal with OllieWP.com and this theme is to help educate both long-time and new WordPress creators about the many powerful, new features WordPress has to offer. Please feel free to dig through the code and learn a bit more about how to make WordPress block themes. \u270c\ufe0f\nTable of Contents\n\nGetting Started with Ollie\nWorking with Block Themes\n\nSite Editor\nPatterns\nGlobal Styles\nTemplate Parts\nExport Your Site\n\n\nDeveloper Notes\nLicense\nBeta Feedback\nAbout the Creator\n\nGetting Started with Ollie\n\nCheck out a full live demo of the Ollie theme. View Ollie Demo\nDownload the Ollie theme zip to install on your WordPress site. Download Ollie Theme\nDownload a zip of the Ollie demo site that can be imported into LocalWP. Download Ollie LocalWP Blueprint\n\nOllie is built for modern WordPress features and requires WordPress 6.0 or later. To get started, download the theme and install it into your WordPress website by going to Appearance \u2192 Themes \u2192 Add New.\nI've also included a blueprint of the Ollie demo site that can be imported into LocalWP. This will create a site exactly like you see on the demo, cutting out all the setup steps. Simply download the blueprint and drag the zip file onto the LocalWP app to create the site. Use the username ollie and password demo to log in to the blueprint.\nWorking with Block Themes\nOnce you activate Ollie, it will largely behave like any other traditional WordPress theme. You can create posts and pages just like you always have. However, as a block theme, Ollie also supports powerful new features like the site editor, patterns, global styles, and more.\nA block theme is a WordPress theme with templates entirely composed of blocks so that in addition to post and page content, the block editor can also be used to edit all areas of the site \u2014 headers, footers, templates, and more.\nSite Editor\nThe WordPress site editor is the new way to build beautiful websites with WordPress. Using blocks, patterns, and a full suite of drag-and-drop design tools, you can build pages right inside WordPress without an extra page builder.\nTo edit your site via the site editor, go to Appearance \u2192 Editor. Here, you can create and edit templates, create menus, customize your website styles, color palette, typography, block styles, and much more. This interface is where you'll design and build your site before exporting it later.\n\n\n\n\n\nsite-editor.mp4\n\n\n\n\n\nPatterns\nPatterns are pre-designed page elements that can be used to quickly design a page section or a full page layout. Instead of designing a page from scratch, WordPress creators can now lean on patterns to quickly design their full website in the WordPress Site Editor.\nYou can access Ollie's patterns via the block inserter on posts, pages, or in the site editor.\nCreating page designs with patterns\nTo create the pages you see on the Ollie theme demo, simply insert Ollie's full-page patterns onto any page, and apply the No Page Title template via the editor sidebar. This template removes the default page title, which better accommodates the full-page patterns, so make sure you have an H1 in your design for SEO best practices.\n\n\n\n\n\npatterns-4k.mp4\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Styles\nGlobal styles is the user interface in the Site Editor where you can modify all the styles associated with your site. This could be typography, fonts, button colors, link colors, layout defaults, and more.\nGlobal styles is powered by a theme.json in the root of the theme folder. This configuration file lets you define site-wide and block-specific styles to be used by the global styles interface.\n\n\n\n\n\nglobal-styles.mp4\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplate Parts\nA template part is a part of your site that appears across most or all pages. The most common template parts are for the header, footer, and sidebar of a website. Template parts let you easily make global changes to the design or markup of global site elements.\n\n\n\n\n\ntemplate-parts.mp4\n\n\n\n\n\nExport Your Site\nOnce you've finished building and customizing your site with the site editor, you can export a zip to install on another site. While in the site editor, go to the Options menu (upper right hand corner), and select Export under the Tools heading. WordPress will write all of your changes to a theme zip file.\n\n\n\n\n\nexport.mp4\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper Notes\nThe Ollie theme works out of the box, so no build steps are required. However, I have included a Composer file that is used for linting to PHP and WordPress core standards.\n\ncomposer run lint\ncomposer run wpcs:scan\ncomposer run wpcs:fix\n\nLicense\nOllie is licensed under the GPL-3.0 license.\nBeta Feedback\nOllie is currently in beta and looking for any and all feedback. Please open a new issue for bug reports, feature requests, or general feedback.\nAbout the Creator\nOllie was created by Mike McAlister, a code-slinging, pixel-pushing, team-building, award-winning creator from Planet Earth.\n\nCheck out my website\nFind me on Twitter\nRead my writings at Ollie and Liftoff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n      A finely-crafted WordPress block theme by Mike McAlister\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nolliewp.com\n\n\nTopics\n\n\n\n  wordpress\n\n\n  template\n\n\n  design\n\n\n  wordpress-theme\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n        Readme\n \nLicense\n\n\n\n\n\n     GPL-3.0 license\n    \n\n\n\nStars\n\n\n\n\n\n76\n    stars\n\nWatchers\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n    watching\n\nForks\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n    forks\n\n\n\n        Report repository\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Releases\n      1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Release\n\n          Latest\n \nMar 27, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Packages 0\n\n\n        No packages published \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHP\n88.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHTML\n6.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS\n5.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n        \u00a9 2023 GitHub, Inc.\n        \n\n\n\nFooter navigation\n\nTerms\nPrivacy\nSecurity\nStatus\nDocs\nContact GitHub\nPricing\nAPI\nTraining\nBlog\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    You can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n  \n\n\n\n\nYou signed in with another tab or window.
