See the Rapid Antigen Testing section below for more information. Updated Stanford University testing locations and hours can be found on the Stanford COVID-19 testing locations flyer and location map.\n\nRapid Antigen Testing\nThe university is making rapid antigen tests available for faculty, staff, postdocs, and students at the following locations:\nAFDC\n489 Arguello Way, Stanford\nPick Up: 8AM \u2013 4PM (M-F)\nEH&S\n484 Oak Road, Stanford\nPick Up: 8AM \u2013 4PM (M-F)\nStanford Redwood City\n900 Warrington Ave, Redwood City\nStanford RecWell Front Desk\nPick Up: 9AM \u2013 6PM (M-F)\nTo pick up rapid tests, you will need your Stanford ID and cell phone. You will be asked to scan a QR code to display your pick-up authorization badge on your phone. Staff will check your badge before giving you the tests. If you don\u2019t have a phone, a staff member will manually check your records to verify eligibility. You are able to pick up 4 kits per pickup and up to 8 kits per month.\nWe recommend testing after travel or attending large gatherings before returning to on-campus activities. Information on the FDA\u2019s shelf-life extension of Flowflex brand tests can be found here and here. Faculty, staff, and postdocs can also obtain rapid antigen tests through their health insurance providers. The U.S. government is also offering 4 free rapid antigen tests per household through the mail that can be ordered here.\nGroup Requests for Rapid Antigen Tests (Pick-upUnits may request large quantity test pickup for workgroup, lab, or department distribution if members of the group are unable to pick up kits at Test Pick Up Sites. To request a bulk order of test kits to pick up from EH&S, please submit this form.\nFor Students: How to Get Started with ColorStudents will find information about Color testing here.\u00a0\nPlease note: Once you have received a positive COVID test, you are exempt from Color testing for 90 days.\u00a0\nFor questions related to Stanford\u2019s response to COVID-19 or other health concerns, please fill out this\u00a0EH&S Health Guidance form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 Information\n\nTesting PositiveSymptoms & ExposureCOVID-19 TestingCOVID-19 VaccinationFace Mask GuidanceVisitors and VendorsCleaning and DisinfectionPotential Exposure Building List\n\n\n\nRelevant For\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgram Areas\n\n\nBiosafety & BiosecurityEmergency ManagementEnvironmental ProtectionFire SafetyHealth PhysicsLaboratory SafetyOccupational Health CenterOccupational Safety & HealthTraining & Communications\n\n\n\nRoles\n\nBuilding ManagersConstruction ManagersExternal ContractorsHR ManagersLab ManagersLab ResearchersLab Safety CoordinatorsOffice WorkersParents and FamiliesPrincipal InvestigatorsShops WorkersSupervisors/ManagersUniversity Safety Partners\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nAnimal Research Occupational Health and Safety ProgramBiosafety & BiosecurityCampus SafetyChemical SafetyConstruction and MaintenanceCOVID-19 InformationEco/Sustainable PracticesEmergency PreparednessErgonomicsField Research SafetyFire SafetyGeneral Workplace SafetyHazardous MaterialsHealthy BuildingsLab SafetyLab Setup and ShutdownLaser SafetyOccupational Injury and IllnessRadiation SafetyShop / Makerspace SafetyWaste Disposal\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\nCOVID-19 InformationAbout UsBioRAFTChemical Inventory SystemFind an EH&S SpecialistLessons LearnedRecycling and Disposal GuideRegister for TrainingReport a Safety ConcernRequest ServicesSubmit Work RequestWaste TagWeather ConditionsSafety Store\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n484 Oak Road, Stanford, CA 94305-8007Phone: 650-723-0448\n\n\nDirections Careers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSU Home\nMaps & Directions\nSearch Stanford\nTerms of Use\nEmergency Info\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University,  Stanford, California 94305.\u00a0\u00a0\n\t\t\t\t\tCopyright Complaints\n\n\n\n\n Back to Top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload full instructions here -> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
