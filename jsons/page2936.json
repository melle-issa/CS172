You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to the Sites by disabling cookies on your browser, however, please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Sites. \nLog File Information:\u00a0 \nLog file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.\u00a0 When you register with or view our Sites, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website.\u00a0 These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol addresses or other device identifiers, browser information, Internet Service Provider, operating system, location, date/time stamp, clickstream data, referring/exit pages and URLs, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. \nClear Gifs Information:\u00a0 \nWhen you use the Sites, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously.\u00a0 No personal information is collected using these clear gifs.\u00a0 In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.\u00a0 \nCalifornia Do Not Track Disclosures\nCalifornia Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d (DNT) browser settings. \u00a0DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. \u00a0We do not engage in the collection of personally identifiable information about users\u2019 online activities over time and across third party websites when an individual uses our Sites and therefore do not respond to DNT signals.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nHow we share your information\nWe share your information internally at the CSU to facilitate and manage the purposes listed above, including with third parties whom the University engages to process your personal information on our behalf for the purposes stated above (such as vendors who help the University with our marketing, application processing, financial aid or payment processing, education management, and web hosting).\u00a0 The University may also share your personal data with government and law enforcement agencies or regulators (1) to comply with a legal process, subpoena, order or other legal or regulatory requirement applicable to us; (2) to enforce our terms of use or other policies; or (3) to pursue available legal remedies or defend against legal claims.\u00a0 We may also share your personal information with a third party as requested by you if permitted by this and other University policies and applicable laws and regulations.\u00a0 We will not distribute or share any electronically collected personal information (as defined in subdivision (d) of California Government Code section 11015.5) about users to any third party without prior written permission from the user except in narrow circumstances involving possible violations of Section 502 of the Penal Code or as authorized under law (including but not limited to the Information Practices Act), or to assist another state agency or public law enforcement organization in any case where the security of a network operated by a state agency has been, or is suspected of having been, breached.\nWe fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our Sites or services for illegal activities.\u00a0 We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.\u00a0 Release of your personal information for security purposes, as described in this Notice to any person or entity, including, without limitation, in connection with any government investigation or litigation, shall be based on a determination made solely by us, as permitted by law or, for those not in the EEA, exercising our discretion for which you expressly grant permission to us in accordance with this Notice.\n\n\n\n\nHow we protect your information\nWe take reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information against loss, unauthorized access, and illegal use or disclosure.\u00a0 Such personal information is stored by the University in secure locations and University staff is trained on procedures for the management of personal information, including limitations on the release of information. Access to personal information is limited to those members of the University\u2019s staff whose work requires such access.\u00a0 Confidential information is destroyed according to the University\u2019s records retention schedule.\u00a0 The University conducts periodic reviews to ensure that proper information management policies and procedures are understood and followed.\u00a0 \nThe security of your personal information is important to us, but please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.\u00a0 While we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to the Sites, and you do so at your own risk.\u00a0 Once we receive your transmission of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.\u00a0 However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.\u00a0 While we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online.\nWe encourage all individuals to use appropriate safeguards to secure their computers and the information on those computers.\u00a0 For additional information on online privacy and security, please see the University\u2019s policies and procedures related to Information Security; you may also consult with the California Attorney General\u2019s Privacy Enforcement and Protection.\nIn the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly investigate and notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in the CSU Information Security Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.\nLinks to Other Websites\nWe are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Sites nor the information or content contained in them, and we make no warranty, either express or implied, concerning the content of any such site, including the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or suitability of them for any particular purpose, nor do we warrant that any such site or content is free from any claims of copyright, trademark, or other infringement of the rights of third parties, or that any such site or content is devoid of viruses or other contamination.\u00a0 We may provide links to other websites to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of linked sites does not imply endorsement by the University or CSU of any of the linked sites.\u00a0 Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Sites to another website, our Notice is no longer in effect.\u00a0 Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our Sites, is subject to that website\u2019s own rules and policies.\u00a0 Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.\u00a0 We do not ensure the security of your personal information if you visit websites not belonging to CSU, nor are we the data controller for any information collected on those sites unless we specifically state so.\u00a0 We further reserve the right to terminate a link to a third party site at any time.\n\n\n\n\nAccess and choice\nWe comply with all applicable regulations regarding data retention and deletion of personal data and retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected (including for college operations), for strategic planning, and to comply with applicable laws and retention requirements.\u00a0 You can ask to review, update or make changes to the personal information we maintain about you, or exercise your option of having your personal information discarded without reuse or distribution, by sending a written request to the postal or email address set out below.\u00a0 We may take a reasonable period of time to respond.\u00a0 If you request the deactivation or change of information on our system, such information may be retained in our backup systems for a period of time subject to technology restrictions, or as a precaution against systems failures.\u00a0 Some information may be retained for longer periods as required by law, contract or auditing requirements or as otherwise described in this Notice.\nYou have the option to decline providing information about yourself online and may use other methods, such as U.S. mail, to respond to requests for information or to communicate with us.\u00a0 You may use the contact information listed below to ask about additional alternatives to providing or obtaining information through use of our Sites.\nBy providing us your email address, you consent to our use of your email address to send you Site and service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail.\u00a0 We may also use your email address to send you other messages, including, but not limited to, newsletters, information on campus activities, programs and events, legal updates, changes to features of our Sites or services, or other account information.\u00a0 Where required by law, we will obtain your consent before sending you specific types of email or other communications.\nYou can choose not to receive such emails from us by \u201cunsubscribing\u201d using the instructions in any email you receive from us, or by sending a written request to the postal or email address set out below. \u00a0It may take up to thirty (30) business days for us to process your request. This will not stop us from sending emails about your account or your transactions with us, or any other service-related email. \u00a0Opting out does not affect our communications with you via telephone or mail nor does it affect our use of your non-personally identifiable information as described in this Notice.\nEEA Data Subject Rights\nIf you are an individual located in the EEA only, you have certain rights with regard to your personal data collected while you are in the EEA.\u00a0 These rights may include right of access, right of correction, right to be forgotten, right to restrict processing of your identifiable personal information, right to notice related to changes/deletion/processing limits, right to data portability, right to objection, right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing, and right to withdraw consent.\u00a0 Some of these rights are restricted by law to information that was collected on the basis of explicit consent, or are restricted by other conditions (such as necessity for contract or to comply with the law).\u00a0 You have the right to contact us in connection with the exercise of your rights under applicable EEA law, which you can do through the contact information below, or by sending an email to privacy@calstate.edu.\u00a0 We will respond to your written request without unreasonable delay and in accordance with any deadlines imposed by law.\u00a0 Unless we notify you at the time of your request, we will not charge you any fee in connection with the exercise of your rights.\u00a0 If you are not satisfied with our response, you have the right to complain to or seek advice from a supervisory authority and/or bring a claim against us in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nChanges to Our Privacy Notice\nWe reserve the right to modify this Notice at any time.\u00a0 It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for other operational purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our Sites page, as determined by the University in its sole discretion.\u00a0 We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Notice.\u00a0 You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable email address for you, and for periodically visiting our Sites and this Notice to check for any changes.\u00a0 \nFor changes to our Privacy Notice, it is our policy to post any changes we make on this page.\u00a0 The date the Notice was last revised is identified at the top of the page.\u00a0 We will provide notice on the Sites, or at www.csusb.edu, prior to the effective date of any change.\u00a0 Your continued use of the Sites after any change in this Notice will constitute your acceptance of such change.\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\nIf you have any questions about this Notice or the practices of our Sites, you may contact us using one of the following methods:\n\nCall: [Chief Data Officer at 909-537-5052]\nEmail: privacyprotection@csusb.edu\u00a0or privacy@calstate.edu\nSend mail to:\u00a0 [CSUSB, 5500 University Parkway, San Bernardino, CA 92407]\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nSecurity\nFor site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this Government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
