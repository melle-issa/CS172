We have a full time staff Monday through Friday to care for your needs. First aid is always available during clinic hours to anyone on campus. Please dial 911 for emergencies from anywhere on campus for assistance. We are staffed with Doctors, Physician Assistants, Nurse Practitioners, Nurses, Medical Assistants, and a Pharmacy.\u00a0Our center has contracted with local lab and X-ray services for our students. Our psychiatric services are limited to psychiatric medication evaluation and management.\u00a0 For counseling or therapy services please contact Counseling and Psychological Services. They also have a full time staff of Marriage and Family Therapists, Clinical Social Workers, Psychologists and supervised interns.\nHealth services are also offered at the CSUSB Palm Desert Campus in the\u00a0R.D. and Joan Dale Hubbard Student Health and Psychological Counseling Center\u00a0located in HS-119.\nAs an enrolled student at CSUSB, you pay a Student Health Fee and are eligible for health and counseling services at the Student Health Center and Counseling & Psychological Services office. Your Student Health Fee supports and finances the operation of the Health Center. Although basic health care is provided, treatment for major illnesses and injury (e.g., motor vehicle accidents), as well as certain conditions requiring a specialist or hospitalization, are beyond the scope of service. Students are referred to an outside provider for these illnesses or injuries and it is the student's responsibility to pay the costs associated with the referral. It is important to carry health insurance. Faculty and staff are not eligible for services except in case of emergency.\nPlease call ahead to schedule an appointment and with any inquiries you may have. There is no charge for routine office visits.\nTypical types of clinic services offered are listed below.\u00a0 Some charges may apply.\n\nPhysicals: nursing, sports, teaching, pre-employment\nBirth control: pill, ring, implant, IUCs, depo\nEmergency contraception, Sexually Transmitted Infection testing, pap smears\nVaccines: Hepatitis B, MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella), TDAP (Tetanus, Diphtheria, and Pertussis), flu shots\nTB skin test: 2 appointments required\n\nPatient Rights & Responsibilities\nThe Student Health Center is committed to providing the best possible service to our students.\u00a0\u00a0Please take a minute to become more familiar with your Patient Rights and Responsibilities.\nPrivacy Practices\nWe are committed to preserving the privacy of your personal health information. \u00a0The Student Health Center is a covered entity under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). \u00a0HIPAA is United States legislation that provides data privacy and security provisions for safeguarding medical information. \u00a0We are required by Federal regulations and California law to protect the privacy of your medical information and to provide you with this notice:\nThis NOTICE OF PRIVACY PRACTICES describes how medical information about you may be used and disclosed and how you get access to this information.\nPlease read it carefully.\nConcerns or Comments\nStudent concerns may be addressed to: Beth Jaworski, Ph.D., Executive Director of Health, Counseling and Wellness, and sent via e-mail to:\u00a0 Bjaworsk@csusb.edu.\u00a0A suggestion box is available in the waiting room and the contents addressed per the Quality Improvement committee. A patient satisfaction survey is conducted annually. Trends are analyzed and adjustments made as needed. A patient may appeal to the Title IX director, University Ombuds Services, or the Associate Vice President of Student Affairs. This reporting policy is posted on the patient Rights and Responsibilities poster displayed in the Health Center.\nAccreditation\nOne of the most important things we do to earn your trust is to participate voluntarily in the quality assessment program of the\u00a0Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC). We have earned AAAHC Accreditation for over 25 years.\u00a0 Our long-standing accreditation tells you that AAAHC's independent team of health care professionals has taken a close look at us and has found that we meet their rigorous, nationally recognized standards for quality health care services.\nMeasles\nTo learn more about the infection and how to avoid catching it, please follow the links and watch the videos below.\nThe single best way to prevent catching the measles is to get vaccinated.
