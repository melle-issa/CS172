Generally, and in accordance with university Buildings and Grounds Policy, filming is not allowed in classrooms, student residences or in the library unless otherwise previously approved through StratComm. Previous approval requires contacting a member of the StratComm team.\nCommercial Shoots on Campus\nAccording to the current SDSU Buildings and Grounds regulations, filming for commercial purposes requires advanced, written approval and is subject to additional requirements. Approval is not required for filming or photography that is part of the university. However, reservations for campus outdoor space or facilities may be required. Risk Management review may also be required. For more information and appropriate approvals, please contact Alyssa Longeuay with Aztec Shops Ltd. by calling 619-594-2143 or by emailing [email\u00a0protected].\nCommercial Shoot on campus\n\n\nMedia Parking on Campus\nBeginning in Spring 2020, media outlets will be issued individual virtual parking permits assigned to each news vehicle. The permits will require yearly renewal and expire on June 30 of each year.\nTo obtain a parking permit, the recognized San Diego regional media outlet must submit a permit application through the StratComm office. Please designate on the application the license plate number of each registered news vehicle requesting a parking permit. The permit will be valid from July 1 to June 30 of each year. Upon expiration of the permit, a new application will need to be filed by June 1 of each year. Upon application approval, media outlets will receive email confirmation.\u00a0\nParking permits can be used in any of the campus parking structures or open lots with the exception of parking lot 5, 6A, and 13. At no time is media parking permitted: in front of Hepner Hall, on Campanile, Centennial and Cuicacalli Walkways; next to red curbs; in any ADA parking space, special permit areas; or when blocking a fire lane or fire hydrant. Parking in these areas will result in a parking citation. Failure to comply with university parking regulations will result in the revoking of said permit.\nCampus media relations personnel are unable to assist crews receiving tickets. The individual who received the parking ticket is fully responsible for addressing the citation.\n\n\nNews Conferences\nFor planned news events, parking instructions will be provided in advance. For unannounced news events, utilize any of the available lots and structures listed below, or contact a media relations representative for information on parking arrangements and/or availability.\n\n\nPublic Records Act Requests\nRequests for public inspection of SDSU records under the California Public Records Act (Gov Code section 6250 et seq) may be submitted in writing via mail, email or facsimile. Certain records are exempt from public disclosure, and purely personal and private information may be redacted. The Public Records Act does not require the campus to create documents that do not already exist.\nUpon receipt of a Public Records Act request, SDSU will conduct a reasonable search for the requested records and respond to your request within 10 calendar days.\nMore information on how to direct requests for SDSU records, including contact information for different university departments, and also ways to access documents is available through Business and Financial Affairs online.\nRequesting Public Records\n\n\nUniversity Drone Policy\nSan Diego State University\nSDSU is aware of and supportive of the growing use of drones for research, recreation and commercial applications.\nThe use of drones by media partners, or small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAS), on the SDSU campus is regulated by Section 31.0 of the Buildings and Grounds Policy. Currently, all use of drones on campus is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Director of Emergency Management or StratComm.\nDrone use by media partners must be pre-submitted for approval by StratComm via email at least three days before the proposed flight date. In the email, applicants must include pilot licensing information, aircraft specification and insurance. SDSU reserves the right to restrict drone operations at any time. Issuance of permit is good for one-time use and does not constitute blanket authority to operate a drone on campus.\nAll approved use of drones must also be in compliance with current FAA regulations (COA, 333 Exemption, Rule 107). Additionally, per FAA policy, you currently cannot fly a small UAS over anyone not directly participating in the operation.\nGeneral campus B-roll, captured via drone, is available for media outlets. Please contact StratComm for file video. A mandatory courtesy is required for use.\nSDSU Mission Valley\nThe use of drones on San Diego State University property must be in compliance with the Campus Drone Policy, which can be found at: https://bfa.sdsu.edu/safety/emergency/news. All drone use for all purposes must be approved in advance by the Emergency Preparedness Manager in the SDSU Police Department.\nMore specific information is set forth in Section 31.0 of the SDSU Buildings and Grounds policy.\nFor the safety of construction crews working on SDSU property and for protection of personal property, the additional rules stated below apply to those who wish to fly drones above any SDSU Mission Valley site location, which includes the future River Park and Aztec Stadium.\nAll drone operators are required to have documented permission and clearance to fly drones over any SDSU property or location.\nTo gain clearance, contact Associate Vice President of Public Safety and Community Empowerment Josh Mays by emailing [email\u00a0protected] You must submit your request at least one week prior to the first day of your requested fight date(s) so the proper authorities are able to review your request. Members of the news media who wish to fly a drone over the site should contact the SDSU Media Relations team by emailing [email\u00a0protected] or [email\u00a0protected].\nAdditional Guidelines for Drone Use above SDSU Mission Valley site:\n\nFollow all FAA regulations at https://www.faa.gov/uas/\nDrone operators must remain off-site and are not allowed to operate from on the SDSU Mission Valley site as it is an active construction site.\nNo flying is permitted during active construction hours at the SDSU Mission Valley site, which is typically Monday thru Saturday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. or during possible evening construction hours.\nFlying height: Drone operators must fly at least 50 feet above the site, which requires prior FAA authorization. Flying below 50 feet increases safety risks.\nNo flying \u201cthrough\u201d or around construction equipment or \u201cthrough\u201d existing or new structures. Please stay at least 50 feet away from the existing San Diego Stadium structure and Aztec Stadium.\nDo not disturb any workers or other individuals on site with your flights.\nRemain in a continuous line of sight with your drone during the entirety of your flight. If you cannot see your drone, you are not flying according to FAA regulations.\n\nMore information on SDSU Mission Valley\n\nSDSU NewsCenterSDSU MagazineSDSU Publications\n\nThe SDSU Media Relations Team\n\n\n\u00a0La Monica Everett-HaynesAssociate Vice President and Chief Communications Officer(619) 594-0232[email\u00a0protected]\nCory MarshallSenior Director of Media Relations(619) 594-0279[email\u00a0protected]\u00a0Lainie McCorkleSenior Media Relations Officer(619) 594-1031[email\u00a0protected]\nSusanne Clara BardScience/Research Writer and Media Relations Officer(619) 594-0389[email\u00a0protected]Daniella RodilesSDSU Imperial Valley Marketing and Media Relations Specialist\u00a0(760) 556-7446[email\u00a0protected]\n\n\nWelcome to SDSU\nApplyVisitGet Info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyoutube\ntwitter\nfacebook\ninstagram\n\n\n\n\n619-594-5200\n               \t\t\t\t\t\t\t5500 Campanile Drive\n               \t\t\t\t\t\t\tSan Diego, CA 92182\n\nMaps\nParking\n\n\n\n\nCampus Directory\nEmployment\nMedia Relations\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Contact\nNetwork Status\nStrategic Plan\nNewsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nDocument Readers\nDigital Privacy Statement\nCampus Safety Reports\nFeedback\n\n\u00a9 2023 San Diego State UniversityAll Rights ReservedLast Updated\nback to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Updated 4/26/23",
