Our community reaches out to new students and their families to help them adjust to life at Stanford\u2013to help them realize their goals and prepare for the future.\u00a0\nOur roots at Stanford date back earlier than the institution itself. Built on land originally inhabited by the\u00a0Muwekma Ohlone Tribe, Stanford University opened its doors in 1891.\u00a0 Matriculating in 1894, John Milton Oskison was the first Native American to graduate from Stanford in 1898. Fueled by the spirit of social and political change during the 1960s, a group of Native students worked with the university administration to increase educational opportunities for Natives at Stanford. Since then, our numbers have increased, and students have continued to take an active role in increasing opportunities for our community at Stanford.\u00a0\nToday, there are more than 450 undergraduate and graduate students representing more than 50 tribes and island communities studying at Stanford.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \nHighlights from the Community\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n52nd Annual Stanford Powwow\nThe 52nd Annual Stanford Powwow will be held May 12-14, 2023!\u00a0\nJoin us as we celebrate Mother\u2019s Day Weekend at Eucalyptus Grove.

A project years in the making,\u00a0Indigenous Excellence at Stanford: Histories, Voices, and Perspectives from the Past 50 Years, commemorates a legacy of activism, advocacy, ingenuity, and excellence that has come to define the Stanford Native community.\u00a0\nView the StoryMap Here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlumni News\nInaugural Stanford Indigenous Alumni Summit 2022\nStanford's first Indigenous Alumni Summit, originally imagined as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO) in 2020-21, was held on October 20th, 2022!
