Pressable\u2019s cloud-based architecture ensures your website is available when it matters most with our 100% uptime guarantee.\n\n\nSee Our Plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nReliable web hosting for WordPress you can count on\n\nPressable pushes the status quo by being the only WordPress hosting provider to guarantee 100% network uptime in our SLA. That means our fully redundant, global network will be available 100% of the time (excluding scheduled maintenance).\u00a0\nThat\u2019s not to say our network doesn\u2019t ever experience issues. But, it is designed to automatically failover to another data center so that your website continues working like normal even if servers or other parts of the infrastructure fail. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does 100% network uptime matter?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a website visitor can\u2019t find you online or access your website due to unplanned downtime, it negatively impacts your branding and your bottom line. As a result, your business can suffer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss of traffic\nEven a few seconds of downtime will cost you valuable web traffic, translating into fewer leads, as well as a loss of new business and revenue. 100% network uptime means you can rest easy knowing your site is performing its best at all times.\n\n\nDrop in SEO rankings\nWhen a site experiences frequent downtime, the search engines notice as well. Our 100% network uptime guarantee gives you peace of mind that your SEO efforts won\u2019t be undermined by service interruptions.\n\n\nDamage to your brand\nYou put a lot of time and effort into building a brand people can trust. But, if a customer or prospect can\u2019t get to your website, that can have a negative impact on your overall reputation.100% network uptime ensures people can find you when it matters most.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChat With Sales\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat factors impact uptime? And how does Pressable solve them?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral reasons can cause downtime on your website and it\u2019s important to understand them. They include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheduled maintenance\nEvery website requires regular maintenance. To minimize potential negative impact, we regularly perform maintenance work on our servers during off-peak hours.\n\n\nWebsite issues\nToo many plugins and coding issues can cause your website to run slowly. Fortunately, our team of experts is here to provide guidance and advice aimed at getting the best performance out of your WordPress website.\n\n\nTraffic spikes\nWith other hosts, a sudden surge in website traffic can cause your site to be sluggish. Pressable\u2019s automatic scaling and architecture ensure your site runs its best even with a heavy load of visitors.\n\n\nSecurity issues\nFrom injecting malicious code to stealing security credentials, there are many ways hackers bring down websites. Our WordPress hosting solutions come with advanced security features - including Jetpack -\u00a0 to prevent DDoS attacks and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Our Plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Grow your business with the best WordPress hosting                    \n\nLooking to build and launch a business website?
