Instructions for completing the request are linked in the\u00a0images below.\u00a0\nThe certification\u00a0process is required in order for you to receive educational benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). These benefits include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n\nVA EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS\n\n\n\nMontgomery GI Bill\u00ae - Active Duty (Chapter 30)\nPost - 9/11\u00a0GI Bill\u00ae (Chapter 33)\nPost - 9/11\u00a0GI Bill\u00ae (Chapter 33) Edith Nourse Rogers Scholarship\nPost - 9/11\u00a0GI Bill\u00ae (Chapter 33) Marine Gunnery Sergeant John\nMontgomery GI Bill\u00ae - Select Reserves (Chapter 1606)\nVeterans Educational Assistance Program (Chapter 32)\nSurvivor & Dependents Assistance (Chapter 35)\nVocational Readiness Program (Chapter 31)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If you are only using the College Fee Waiver for Veteran Dependents (Cal Vet Fee Waiver) or Department of Defense Tuition Assistance, you are NOT\u00a0required to submit certification requests using this system. If you are using either of these benefits in addition to one of the Chapter/VA benefits listed above, please submit the request using the steps below.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExplore Veterans Benefits\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNew Certification Request\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUpdate VA Certification Request\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVA SCHOOL CERTIFYING OFFICIAL FOR CSUSB\nService members, veterans, reservists, National Guard members and dependents may be eligible for various educational benefits. The Veteran Success Center (VSC) will help guide you through the available\u00a0benefits\u00a0and various applications and explain the benefits you may be eligible to receive. Depending on what program you are eligible for, benefits can cover some or all of the tuition costs, assist with living expenses and more. Using military educational benefits does not automatically prevent a student from receiving financial aid, and it is strongly recommended that everyone fills out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). \u00a0More information for veterans, active duty service members and their families who plan on attending the California State University system, please visit their Troops to College website.\nFor information on the timeline for financial aid, please visit the Financial Aid webpage for important dates and times at\u00a0https://www.csusb.edu/financial-aid/important-dates-and-times.\u00a0\nAll VA education\u00a0benefits are processed through Jaime Espinoza, the Certifying Official for Veterans Education Benefits. He provides guidance on completing and filing VA educational forms for federal and state education assistance programs. He can also assist with special registration procedures required for student veterans who are sponsored through one of the\u00a0Cal Vet fee waivers.\u00a0Each semester it is recommended that students receiving VA benefits contact the school certifying official by\u00a0completing the Online Veterans Module Via MyCoyote.\u00a0 \u00a0For assistance on this process please contact the Veterans Success Center.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n'GI Bill\u00ae' is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
