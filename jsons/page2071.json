Fees listed in published schedules or student accounts may need to be increased when public funding is inadequate. Therefore, CSU must reserve the right, even after fees are initially charged or initial fee payments are made, to increase or modify any listed fees.\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Mission\nOur mission is simple.
