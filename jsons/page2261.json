Often wry and satirical, she writes with a powerfully determined voice about women, writing, and travel. Her most recent publication, The Romance of Elsewhere (Counterpoint Press), is a collection of essays about intense wanderlust and the struggle of defining \u201chome.\u201d Lynn says the central question of the collection is \u201cwhere or what is home?\u2019 To which I\u2019d have to say, nowhere.\u201d She continues, \u201cWhich is not to say there aren\u2019t places in which I feel at home\u2014Greece, for instance, and the African bush. I also feel at home in the past. And yet there is also a certain liberation in being untied from the past\u2014from the bonds of home. And a sadness, a great sadness. As you see, I\u2019m still looking for an answer.\u201d\nFreed grew up in Durban, South Africa, and moved to New York as a graduate student to study English Literature at Columbia University. She is Professor Emerita of English at the University of California in Davis and has published numerous, award-winning works in fiction and nonfiction. Her most recent novel is The Last Laugh (Sarah Crichton Books), about a group of older women who flee their previous lives by moving to a Greek island\u2014something many of us have fantasized about. It delves into what freedom really entails and the dynamic complexity of friendships between women.\nOn writing, Lynn says \u201cleaving home is perhaps the central experience of the writer\u2019s life. The restless pursuit of a way back while remaining steadfastly at a distance \u2014 this is the enigma that informs the writer\u2019s perspective.\u201d By her own account she is neither fast nor disciplined as a writer. She says \u201cI\u2019m hard put to know which obsess me. The cult of the self? The self-promotion, selfies, self-this, self-that to which we\u2019re all subjected? Old age? Grown children?\u2026Something will come up, or nothing. If nothing, I\u2019ll try not to force something onto the page.\u201d The result is prose full of candor and wit that looks deeply at what it means to be a woman and what it means to be a writer.\nTo read more about Lynn Freed and her writing, check out this interview on The Rumpus.\nPlease join us for a thought-provoking evening with Lynn Freed this Thursday, November 1st at 7:30 pm in\u00a0Zingg Recital Hall (ARTS 150).

Michelle got her start like many of us: writing and hoping for the best, even when sometimes the \u201cbest\u201d takes us down a path we didn\u2019t prepare for. Tea doesn\u2019t hold back in her work as she navigates what being a person trying to stay true to themselves means.\nIn the 90\u2019s, Michelle found herself overwhelmingly surrounded by the testosterone and misogyny found in the literary community. Instead of retreating, she decided to take the initiative, grab the literary community by the balls, and create her own open mic with friend Sini Anderson. This new program, called Sister Spit, strove to create a place for the queer literary community to gather and share their spoken word. Tea\u2019s inspiration to start the group started with questioning:\n\u201cWhere are all the other queer female writers?\u2026They\u2019re not coming cause they don\u2019t feel welcome and it makes sense that they don\u2019t feel welcome. You had to really fight for a space there\u201d (Michelle Tea, Electric Literature).\nAlthough Sister Spit was originally geared towards cis women in the queer community, the fluidity of gender and the social acceptance emerging in the past years have pushed Sister Spit to widen their audience and participant demographics to engage people from all walks of life, so long as they vibe with their original message of \u201cfeminism, queerness, humor and provocation.\u201d\nIn 2003, Michelle created Radar Productions to give the queer community of San Francisco \u00a0access to free and affordable literary arts programs that they weren\u2019t finding in the male-saturated literary community. This nonprofit organization still hosts a traveling Sister Spit tour every year, featuring authors like MariNaomi, Wo Chan, Jay Dodd, and Virgie Tovar. In addition to her work with Radar Productions and Sister Spit, Michelle Tea is the curator for Amethyst Editions, a Feminist Press Imprint, and continues to strive to unapologetically share her art and create an inclusive environment for the queer literary community.\nMichelle Tea\u2019s new, razor-sharp essay collection,\u00a0Against Memoir: Complaints, Confessions & Criticisms, reflects on the cultural artifacts that have challenged and calibrated her against the world. She writes on \u201cArt and Music,\u201d \u201cLove and Queerness,\u201d and her usual spectrum, \u201cWriting and Life.\u201d In her writing, Michelle is someone we all can easily relate to. From pondering her personal struggles, to demonstrating what life means to her, Tea\u2019s life stories allow us to truly understand how our own unique situations are what define us. Her fearless reflection on times of previous struggle has allowed her to see her growth and acceptance, which is something we all can take from. Tea has a knack for slaying her inner demons and conveying her stories to the audience in the most comical way possible. Her overall style makes people think that we can still find light even in the darkest of situations. \nAgainst Memoir rebels against the traditional autobiographical text we have seen in Tea\u2019s previous works. In this essay collection, she interweaves her thoughts and experiences with film, books, and important figures to move past a singular narrative into a collective one about our time. Some of the pieces within the collection have been published from previous speeches, readings, and talks, including one from 2016 at Butte College. Within her work, she keeps her readers entranced with her powerful yet quirky assertions all while offering herself as a model for activism. In her essay, \u201cThe City to a Young Girl,\u201d she says, \u201cI guess that\u2019s my issue with writing as activism: how hard it is for it to change the actual systems that oppress and limit and kill.\u201d Through her writing we see a queer woman who fights for the freedom of those who are chained by the stigma of social and political views. \nOther works by Michelle Tea include Valencia\u2014which has received the Lambda Literary Award for Best Lesbian Fiction, and was adapted into a movie in 2013\u2014and the young adult fantasy trilogy Mermaid In Chelsea Creek, among many others. \nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Michelle Tea this Monday, October 8th at 7:30 in PAC 134 for a reading from Against Memoir, a Q&A, and book signing. Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, Writer\u2019s Voice readings are free and open to the public.\nWritten by Emily Ribeiro and Jazmin Gomez\n\u00a0\n\n\nOctober 6, 2018watershedcsuc\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll\n\nDiscuss\nGet Inspired\nGet Polling\nGet Support\nLearn WordPress.com\nTheme Showcase\nWordPress Planet\nWordPress.com News\n\n\nTopics\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nUpcoming Events No upcoming events\nArchives\n\nMay 2022\nMarch 2022\nMay 2020\nOctober 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nOctober 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nApril 2017\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nDecember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nApril 2014\nFebruary 2014\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nAugust 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\n\n \n\nFollow me on TwitterMy Tweets \n\n\n\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
