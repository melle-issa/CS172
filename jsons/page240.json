The prize winner is Promiscuous Ruin by Julian Mithra, who receives an honorarium of $250, publication and 25 copies of their book.\n\u200b\nBorrowing sensibility from docupoetics, where lyricism works to comment on an archive, and drawing upon Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cDaniel Boone\u2019s Move to Kentucky,\u201d\u00a0 Promiscuous Ruin is a rich, expansive and wholly original book, and Julian Mithra\u2019s voice is a treasure. In the bygone era of a decaying frontier, deer hunters Lemuel and Lars hitch up as backwoods companions. Each troubled by missing mothers and flinty fathers, they thwart attempts at intimacy, funneling these impulses into fantasies of violence and revenge. Occasioned by brief moments of sublimity, the two edge closer to a blizzard of repressed desire. Only the deer themselves might cede medicine for earthbound wounds.\n\u200b\nReviewers are welcome to contact us for review copies.\n\u200b\nWTAW ha\u0219 selected the following five finalist chapbooks to publish in 2023.\n\u200b\nFinalists (listed alphabetically according to authors' last names)\nOuttakes, Joanna Acevedo\nSomething I Could Say, Stephanie Austin\nMississippi River Museum, Keith Pilapil Lesmeister\nSarra Copia: A Locked-in Life, Nancy Ludmerer\nEggs in Purgatory, Genanne Walsh\n\u200b\nWe would also like to honor the following chapbooks and their authors.\n\u200b\nSemi-finalists\nAnnetta in Style, Stacy Bierlein\nDelivery, Martha Coats\nAttachment Disorders, Alice Hatcher\nThe Slough, Natalie Nebel\nThe Rest of Us, Tisha Marie Reichle-Aguilera\nNeurotypical, Meghan Williams\u00a0\n\u200b\nHonorable Mentions\nAmerican Filigree, Fatima Alharthi\nTherapy, Sean Bernard\nImaginary Places, Alicia Bones\nApplications, Anna Mantzaris\nA Natural Man, Reggie Scott Young\n\u200b\nFind these authors at their websites and on social media.

The award will offer a cash prize, publication, and book contract. The competition will take place in 2023, date to be announced, and Nina McConigley, Joan Silber, and Peter Turchi will judge the competition. More details will follow in the coming months. Watch our newsletter and social media shares.\n\u200b\nMc was the author of One Kind Favor, a novel he said he knew was the most important work of his life. During his six decades of commitment to his art, he published five other novels: At the Gate of All Wonder (Tupelo) , Hyssop (TriQuarterly Press), Little Peg (Antheneum/Macmillan), The Fifth Station (Algonquin Books), and A Waltz (Lynx House Press); a short story collection, The Complete History of New Mexico (Graywolf); a book of short fictions and prose poems, 57 Octaves Below Middle C (Four Way Books); and, most recently, numerous poems. His short fiction appeared in Harper\u2019s, Southern Review, Ploughshares, Missouri Review, and many other literary magazines.\n\u200b\nWe will continue to be honored by Mc's testimony about his experience publishing with WTAW Press.\n\u200b\u00a0\nAs I\u2019ve said to you\u2014and to everyone I know\u2014I have never, ever had a more positive experience from beginning to end (contract to editing; pre-publication promotion and planning: publication planning and preparation and next-stage promotion; post-publication and mid-stage promotion; late-stage promotion that includes nominations for prizes) than I have had with WTAW. Your enthusiasm and wisdom and absolute commitment have been inspiring to me\u2014and confirming to me in my overall life as an artist.\n\nI do not say any of this lightly; after all, I\u2019ve worked with 11 different editors/houses (including Avon and Harper Perennial editors for paperback editions) for my 8 published books, and I\u2019ve had many kinds of good experiences along the way.Find Kevin McIlvoy's ONE KIND FAVOR and more great books in our bookshop.\nComing November 9, 2023, WTAW will proudly publish Kevin McIlvoy's last book of fiction IS IT SO?
