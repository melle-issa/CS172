The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at https://make.wordpress.org/chat/. to Matrix\nThe agenda was to discuss a tentative plan for migration from Slack to Matrix. We have identified a successful migration path which consists of moving over the messages in public channels to matrix rooms. All the messages in public channels would be available in their respective Matrix rooms from Day 1 of Matrix. All users would find themselves to be in the right Matrix rooms as per what Slack channels they have joined.\nPrivate conversations (private channels and direct messages) are best handled by user themselves using a browser extension (Firefox / Chrome).\nWe would use SSO (OIDC) to use WordPress.orgWordPress.org The community site where WordPress code is created and shared by the users.

The OpenID Connect Server plugin was built for this purpose.\nDuring the duration of transition, both would be accessible and messages would be relayed from Slack to Matrix and vice-versa using the help of a bridge. As of now, it works by creating a Slack ghost account on Matrix side and we would be trying to make it possible to not need that and just post Slack side messages as messages from the respective Matrix account of those users. Matrix side messages are posted to Slack by a Slack app masquerading as the user, but not accredited to the actual Slack user.\nComment(s) on Agenda post\n\nAlex Stine: When will a test instance be available?

[GitHub Project]\nShowcase\nThe Showcase website was initially redesigned and launched in December but was reverted to the original design to ensure the site\u2019s\u00a0maximum impact. The Design team will share new designs on the Make WordPress Design blog when they are ready for feedback. The Marketing team will also post on their Make WordPress Marketing blog to clarify the Showcase content creation and moderation process to ensure the case studies are as high-quality as possible. Once the new content has been created and design has been implemented, the Showcase site will relaunch.\nDeveloper (DevDocs)\nThe Developer website design was shared earlier this year with an initial version nearly completed by the Meta team. With that said, the Design team will likely revisit this page to ensure it harmonizes with the overall redesign aesthetic. Development will likely be wrapped up in the following month.

The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at https://make.wordpress.org/chat/. to Matrix\nA big part of the last discussion was around message migration and how to deal with public and private messages. We\u2019ve done some more research on migrating public messages and are currently evaluating whether the\u00a0Slack Matrix migration tool\u00a0could work for us. It operates on Slack export files and requires a fresh Synapse server.\nWe haven\u2019t yet been able to confirm whether it actually can import the messages and hope to be able to share more on the next meeting.\nFor migrating private messages in DMs or private groups we\u2019ve concluded that we won\u2019t want to attempt their migration but will look into providing tools for achieving that.\nHere we\u2019ve found that\u00a0browser\u00a0extensions\u00a0exist which allow you to download your own Slack direct messages inside your browser as a text file. Possibly it\u2019ll be our recommendation to use those tools to export the messages for yourself.\nAccessibilityAccessibility Accessibility (commonly shortened to a11y) refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities.

The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at https://make.wordpress.org/chat/. message history in the eventuality of a migrationMigration Moving the code, database and media files for a website site from one server to another. Most typically done when changing hosting companies. of the Make WordPress Slack workspace to Matrix:\nWhat needs to be preserved / remain accessible?\nIn what way could you see accessing that?\nHow should we deal with private information?\nFor context on the topics discussed here, please see A Meta subproject for evaluating Matrix, where the project was announced.\nStrategies for preserving Slack history\n@psrpinto mentioned that there could be different strategies according to the type of channel (public, private, DM \u2013 since public and private information probably needs to be handled in different ways), and that we need to evaluate what format this message history would be kept in. There could be two options:\nFully integrated into Matrix, with correct senders, timestamps, etc. It should be noted that it might not be possible\nA standalone export that would not be related to matrix in any way.\n@javiercasares commented that private conversations should not be included in this archive, but we would instead notify users so they can perform the archival of their own private conversations. @javiercasares would prefer option 1. above, where the history of public conversations gets imported into the equivalent Matrix rooms.\n@ashfame confirmed that we do not have access to users\u2019 private conversations so users must export their own private conversations, and that migrating public channels is feasible, though somewhat complicated. Migrating private conversations however is more difficult, because of two reasons:\nEven if the user supplies the data they exported themselves, we can\u2019t simply import it, as data would have to be encrypted and those messages need to come from sender\u2019s or author\u2019s session. It can\u2019t just be attributed to them.\nThe actual export itself requires granting access to an OAuth app, which theoretically means the app/code has access to the conversations. Would open-sourcing the code for that be enough?\nSlack export\n@akirk mentions an existing tool for archiving Slack data: https://github.com/felixrieseberg/slack-archive, which allows a user to export their own data, but they would need to run\u00a0npx\u00a0/\u00a0node\u00a0locally which is quite a high requirement.\n@ashfame mentions that this tool requires granting access to an OAuth app to generate a token, personal tokens won\u2019t work. This means the code running has theoretical access to sensitive data, so this tool might not be an option.\n@akirk suggested that we look into exporting the public Slack data into a database and we can later investigate if we can re-insert it into Matrix. and for private data we try to figure out if people can run it locally on their machines and we\u2019d strive to provide a guide for doing so.\n@dd32 mentioned the following:\n\n\nFWIW We\u2019ve had several attempts at making a public slack log on\u00a0W.org, but each time someone has looked into doing it, there\u2019s been limitations in the Slack APIs around making it an \u201cexact copy\u201d of the data.For example, reactions to messages are easy to get retroactively, but syncing them as they happen is difficult. Slack attachments are also heavily used by notifications, and would\u2019ve needed rebuilding into a non-slack UIUI UI is an acronym for User Interface - the layout of the page the user interacts with. Think \u2018how are they doing that\u2019 and less about what they are doing..It might be nice to integrate that with Matrix early on, as in, make sure we have a public Matrix chat log for referencing on make sites / etc. The slack data could then be added to the history of that public log, negating the need to migrate it over to Matrix.Public slack data is exportable with Slack archive tools though by slack admins, but we do NOT have the private-conversations flag enabled (and won\u2019t be enabling it) so Slack admins and APIs don\u2019t have access to private conversations.DMs are\u00a0heavily\u00a0used on this slack instance, to the level that I believe it accounts for between 50-80% of messages sent depending on the day. Private channels account for 1-2% as we don\u2019t actually have many of them.I believe the DMs however are likely bot-messages, because it\u2019s flipped for those reading messages, ~20% of messages are read in DMs, and 75%+ are read in public channels..\u2026 The more I say this, I kind of want to find out why so many DMs are sent but not read\u2026\nSearch UXUX UX is an acronym for User Experience - the way the user uses the UI. Think \u2018what they are doing\u2019 and less about how they do it.\n@akirk enquired about how good the search capabilities on Matrix are today, and whether an external export would provide better searchability.\n@psrpinto mentioned that in their experience the search on Matrix is appropriate, though not as good as Slack\u2019s, and that it\u2019s fair to assume it will continue to get better with time. They also mentioned there are some limitations when searching encrypted rooms, for example, searching encrypted rooms in Element only works in the Desktop App, not in the browser.\nOpen floor\n@alexstine raised concerns about AccessibilityAccessibility Accessibility (commonly shortened to a11y) refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities.

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility) on Matrix:\n\nSlack is well supported and accessible to a very wide audience. Something that is not up for argument, a lot of these open-source/decentralized concepts are not accessible to all or most.\nThe decentralized media world walks a fine line between a great thing and a lot of hypocrisy. On one hand, claiming to give users a voice, on the other hand, knowingly excluding users of assistive tech.\nYears of GitHubGitHub GitHub is a website that offers online implementation of git repositories that can easily be shared, copied and modified by other developers.
