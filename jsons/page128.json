Sherwood Rowland, accepted Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry, marking the first time a public university received the prestigious award in two fields within the same year. Reines was recognized for discovering the neutrino, a new elementary particle of nature that was thought to be undetectable. Rowland\u2019s prize was for the discovery that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) deplete the ozone layer, work that sparked a worldwide and triumphant effort to close the ozone hole. Taken together, these efforts are emblematic of the broad mission of this school: to uncover fundamental truths and to provide transformative discoveries that tangibly improve the world. Reines, who was also our founding dean, said he was motivated by the fact that \u201ceverybody said you couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d This undeterred, unbending spirit continues to flourish to this day.\nread more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlagship Projects\nThe UCI School of Physical Sciences advances humanity through a deeper understanding of the physical science that governs the world.

We seek a historic philanthropic commitment \u2013 a school naming gift. Funding of this magnitude will empower the school to elevate its strong academics and research to elite levels of excellence. A naming gift would ensure that we are able to grow our flagship projects, hire the most dynamic and modern faculty to support our students and research growth, provide premier research facilities, attract and support the best students, and deliver comprehensive innovation through intellectual property protection and commercialization. A naming gift would honor the intrepid spirit and interdisciplinary innovation at the heart of our school. Additionally, the impact of a naming gift for Physical Sciences at UCI will have the ability to completely transform our school. Our 50+ years of precedence has established a prestigious level of scientific tradition while allowing great flexibility in shaping future outcomes for our school.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial feeds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nFaculty\nThey chart the farthest corners of the cosmos, and they solve problems right here on Earth, making our faculty truly universal.\nread more\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nStudents\nOur students bring dynamic ideas, and form the bedrock of our bustling culture of research and discovery.\nread more\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nDepartments\nEach of our four top-ranked departments has a tradition of excellence and a vibrancy all its own.\nread more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst Name\n\n\n\nLast Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\n164 Rowland Hall\nUniversity of California, Irvine\nIrvine, CA 92697-4675\n(949) 824-6506physicalsciences@uci.edu\nReport Campus COVID-19 Case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial\nfacebook\ninstagram\ntwitter\nyoutube\nlinkedin\nsoundcloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Thriving Initiative\n\n\nCOVID19 Resources\n\n\nGiving Priorities\n\n\nImpact\n\n\nGive Now\n\n\nInternal\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\n\u00a9 2020 UC Regents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
