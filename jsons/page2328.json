Hillman will be reading from her new collection, \u201cSeasonal Words with Letters on Fire\u201d at the 1078 Gallery, Tuesday, October 8th at 7:30 pm.\nBorn in Tucson, Arizona in 1951, Hillman has earned degrees at Pomona College and the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. She is currently a professor of creative writing at Saint Mary\u2019s College in Moraga, California and is the author of nine books of poetry.

Hillman was also a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for her collection Bright Existence (1993) and a finalist for the National Book Critic\u2019s Circle Award for her collection Loose Sugar (1997). Her latest collection, Seasonal Works with Letters on Fire (2013) is a nominee for the National Book Award.\nSays Publishers Weekly: \u201cHillman\u2019s fast-moving, energetic, and ample 10th collection blazes with indignation . . . . It\u2019s one page lyrics its one-page lyrics connect the origins of the Roman alphabet, children\u2019s reading habits, topical cries against our present-day wars, the evils of genetically modified seeds, the structure of Greek tragedy (\u201cTiny first with hurt earth spirits/ as in Aeschylus\u201d), prose essays on poetry and protest, daily life on a West Coast campus, and larger-scale objections to the way that human beings have treated the earth\u2026\u2018Around each word you\u2019re reading/ there spins the unknowable flame.\u2019\u201d\nHillman\u2019s poetry explores the way we use and interact with both the written and spoken word. \u00a0Her poetry works to displace our familiarity with language: the same letters we use to communicate \u201cdrone strike\u201d or \u201cmother\u201d on one page have, on another, been literally turned on end as she does in \u201cAutumn Ritual With Hate Turned Sideways.\u201d In the case of \u201cTwo Summer Aubades, After John Clare,\u201d she reduces lines to linguistic building blocks:\n\u00a0\nI. \u00a0towhee [Pipilo crissalis] wakes a human\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 pp cp cp cp chp chp\npppppppppppp\ncppppcpp \u00a0\u00a0cpp \u00a0\u00a0cpp\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a woman tosses)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gulf disaster \u00a0ster sister\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0aster \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0aster as \u00a0\u00a0asp\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ppp cp cp p \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0bp \u00a0bp BP BP\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0scree \u00a0screeeeem \u00a0we\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 we we didn\u2019t\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0neee neeed to move so fast\n2. woman in red sweater to humminbird\n\u00a0\u00a0 sssssss \u00a0we \u00a0sssssss weee\nno i\u2019m not not \u00a0sweet not\n\u00a0sweeeeetie i\u2019m not\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 something to eeeeeeat\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTwo Summer Aubades, After John Clare\u201d \u2013 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgxCNYzuHxI\nThe bold poetics found within the pages of \u201cSeasonal Works With Letters On Fire\u201d are further expressed through Hillman\u2019s approaches to form. Take for instance a haibun entitled \u201cThe Body Politic Loses Her Hair,\u201d which not only does not include a haiku, it does include a 1\u201dx3/4\u201d image of the poet holding a protest sign embedded within the text. Or a seemingly new form: a series of double columned \u201cgalaxies\u201d dedicated to Helen Hillman and Ruth Gander. Hillman is also a vocal environmentalist, so Mother Earth as a potential subject is easy to imagine.\n\u00a0\nRinged Galaxies Work With Our Mother\nas they clean \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in skinny time\nin desert autumn \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0drip on verbena\nscraps of toast \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sorted rubber bands\nscraps of string \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0saved for the least\ndid she have to \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0could someone else save\nbits of matter \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0could fail to rise\nask your doctor \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if cosmic fire\nis right for you \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0when you were born\nkingdom to creature \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0qui coisa\ntheir iambs \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of those\nsome galaxies rise \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as a furnace\nneeds cleaning \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0its arcing noise\nthe mom is our sheperd \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0her diving down\nhummingbird baroque \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0freedom you know\nmy substance\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 was not hid\nfrom thee\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0where I was\nmade in secret\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the visible talks back\nher areas\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 of power\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\njust need \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0not to worry\nbehind the tiny pizza\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0behaviors\naren\u2019t essences\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0you know that\nHillman\u2019s poetry is at once deeply activistic while at the same time capable of transmuting language into its most basic parts.
