million in economic output for the City of Orange, but it\u2019s the intangible benefits for the community that make the biggest impact. \n Staci DumoskiAugust 1, 20224 min read\n\n\nTwo reports released by Beacon Economics, an independent economic research firm, have concluded that \u201c[Chapman University\u2019s] activities generate significant economic output that supports thousands of jobs and creates millions of dollars in essential tax revenues at the state and local levels.\u201d\nAccording to the reports, Chapman University generates more than $213 million in economic output for the City of Orange annually, and more than $1.1 billion for California.\u00a0\nOther significant data from the reports include:\n\n$9.8 million in property taxes paid to the City of Orange between 2011-2021.\n$82.7 million university spending in the City of Orange, $64.4 million in student spending and $2.2 million in visitor spending.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n$52.6 million state and local tax revenue generated by Chapman economic activity .\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThough the university has conducted similar analyses in the past through the A. Gary Anderson Center, they have always focused on Chapman\u2019s economic contributions to the community. The new report digs deeper, exploring the many cultural, social and philanthropic contributions that Chapman provides as well, which are often more difficult to quantify.\u00a0\n\u201dThe value of an institution is in its relationship with the local community,\u201d says university President Daniele C. Struppa. \u201cWe are proud to call Orange our home and want to give back in every way that we can. These numbers are very impressive, but it\u2019s our strong partnerships in the community that are the most meaningful.\u201d\nChapman\u2019s Growing Benefits to the Community\u00a0\n\u201cWith these two reports, we are able to paint a broader picture of all of the ways Chapman is positively contributing to our local community,\u201d says Alisa Driscoll, the university\u2019s vice president of community relations. The Office of Community Relations was created six years ago to be a consistent resource for the university\u2019s neighbors, businesses and nonprofit organizations.\nFor Driscoll, who is a resident of the City of Orange, the most powerful information that these reports provide is not just the direct economic impact of the university \u2013 sales tax, property, tax, all of those critical items to the welfare of our hometown \u2013 but also the ripple effect of Chapman\u2019s contributions to the community.\u00a0\n\u201cFor example, the number of jobs that we\u2019re supporting in our local community is 2,666 in the City of Orange and 5,428 in Orange County as a whole,\u201d she explains. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of people who are being supported just because of Chapman University\u2019s presence in the community. And it\u2019s not just our employees. We\u2019re supporting construction work, real estate, retail, restaurants\u2026 and it\u2019s really a powerful thing to show the university\u2019s impact in that way.\u201d\nThe reports also highlight the amount of community engagement that the university has conducted, which has been an institutional focus over the past several years. \u201cAll of our schools and colleges are giving back in significant ways, and the university has made it a priority to demonstrate that Chapman is proud to be a valuable partner and good neighbor with the communities that surround our campus,\u201d says Driscoll.\u00a0\nHere to Support Our Neighbors\u00a0\nThis report examines community efforts in detail, giving prominence to initiatives that don\u2019t always get much attention.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cBefore working on this report, there were a few things that I was not as fully aware of,\u201d says Driscoll, \u201cone of them being all of the ways Chapman is contributing to our local parks. Chapman University paid to develop the softball field at El Camino Park to make it NCAA compatible. And we continue to maintain that field as well as the baseball field at Hart Park.\u201d\u00a0\nTo date, Chapman has spent almost $450,000 on maintenance costs for Hart Park since June 2017. \u201cThis is something that provides a real tangible community benefit,\u201d says Driscoll. \u201cIt\u2019s not just for the use of our sports teams who were there during the season. It\u2019s available for community use as well.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we feel really passionate about, investing in our local community to provide those additional resources for our neighbors to take advantage of,\u201d says Driscoll.\nSee more highlights from the Community Impact Study or download the full reports.\n\n\nChapman Now City of Orange community impact Community Relations economic impact Orange County \n\n\n\n\n \n\nStaci Dumoski \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-COVID Healing for the Long Haul\n\n\n\n\n\nMisty Levingston Appointed New Director of Black Excellence and Achievement at Chapman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Family Donors Make a Collective Impact On Giving Day\u00a0 Thanks to the enthusiasm of the Chapman Family, Chapman University\u2019s fifth annual Giving Day was an unrivaled success.
