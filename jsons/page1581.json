The project page is http://wp-cli.org/ https://make.wordpress.org/cli/ and PHPUnit in the browser\nWordPress as a VS Code extension\nMobile pluginPlugin A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party editor\nWP-CLI and PHPUnit in the browser\nThe first demo brings popular WordPress terminal tools and a code editor into the browser:\nA significant challenge was executing shell commands in the browser. Although various browser-based Linux implementations were explored, none fully addressed the issue or were feasible within the limited time frame. Consequently, basic commands like ls, cd, and cat were manually implemented, along with the exposure of wp-cli and phpunit.\nBy the end, many wp-cli commands were running, phpunit tests were functional (although not all passed), and the code editor updated live WordPress files \u2013 all while working offline.\nThis project, built by @swissspidy and Florian Blaser, is currently being incubated in WordPress Playground Pull Request #161.\nWordPress dev server as a Visual Studio Code extension\nThe second demo is a WordPress development server that you can start without ever installing MySQLMySQL MySQL is a relational database management system. A database is a structured collection of data where content, configuration and other options are stored. https://www.mysql.com/., PHPPHP The web scripting language in which WordPress is primarily architected. WordPress requires PHP 5.6.20 or higher, or an ApacheApache Apache is the most widely used web server software. Developed and maintained by Apache Software Foundation. Apache is an Open Source software available for free. web server. It works as a Visual Studio Code extension:\nThe primary challenge was understanding the concept of running PHP inside JavaScriptJavaScript JavaScript or JS is an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. WordPress makes extensive use of JS for a better user experience. While PHP is executed on the server, JS executes within a user\u2019s browser. https://www.javascript.com/., which differs from typical PHP or Node.js development. This VS Code extension provides a single-click development environment, potentially benefiting WordCamps, Learn.wp.org courses, and various workshops.\nThis project was built by @danielbachhuber, Adrian Stobbe, Mohannad Rahmani, and @ebinnion and lives in a working GitHub repository created by Daniel. Eventually, it may be moved into the WordPress Playground repository.\nWhile this extension is highly experimental, it is publicly available in Visual Studio Marketplace for everyone to try. The code lives in a GitHub repository and is intended for migrationMigration Moving the code, database and media files for a website site from one server to another. Most typically done when changing hosting companies. to the official WordPress Playground monorepo. If you have experience with VS code extensions and would like to help develop them, your help is most welcome!\nMobile editor\nIn the third demo, @gziolo and @zieladam explored a full WordPress IDEIDE Integrated Development Environment. A software package that provides a full suite of functionality to software developers/programmers. Normally an IDE includes a source code editor, code-build tools and debugging functionality. in the browser. In the video you can see a GutenbergGutenberg The Gutenberg project is the new Editor Interface for WordPress. The editor improves the process and experience of creating new content, making writing rich content much simpler. It uses \u2018blocks\u2019 to add richness rather than shortcodes, custom HTML etc. https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/ blockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. developed entirely in Stackblitz. It\u2019s worth noting that Sandpack + WebContainers emerged as a suitable open-source alternative:\nThis setup allows for building WordPress blocks in the browser, on mobile devices, and even offline. Most npm packages are also supported. It\u2019s believed that this could empower a vast number of new internet users to create within the WordPress ecosystem, even without a desktop device.\nThe Stackblitz example is publicly available here.\nCall for contributions\nAll of these projects are open for future contributions, and you are encouraged to get involved.

Thanks for sharing @zieladam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTim Nolte\n\n8:35 pm on April 13, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nSo I know a while back @helen had brought up the idea of using GitHubGitHub GitHub is a website that offers online implementation of git repositories that can easily be shared, copied and modified by other developers. Public repositories are free to host, private repositories require a paid subscription. GitHub introduced the concept of the \u2018pull request\u2019 where code changes done in branches by contributors can be reviewed and discussed before being merged be the repository owner.  https://github.com/ Codespaces/Dev Containers. Did that idea die due to it being Microsoft/GitHub?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzieladam\n\n4:45 pm on April 14, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nHey Tim,\nCodespaces are great and I\u2019d love to see a WordPress IDEIDE Integrated Development Environment. A software package that provides a full suite of functionality to software developers/programmers. Normally an IDE includes a source code editor, code-build tools and debugging functionality. based on them. AFAIK you can already run WordPress there as they use cloud instances and support nearly everything you can run locally.\nIt\u2019s not either/or \u2013 I just wanted to share a few cool things that recently happened around Playground. \nPlayground is different from Codespaces in that it runs in your browser which means it\u2019s private, free, works offline, and can be embedded in a massively visited site like WordPress.orgWordPress.org The community site where WordPress code is created and shared by the users. This is where you can download the source code for WordPress core, plugins and themes as well as the central location for community conversations and organization.  https://wordpress.org/. It\u2019s also open and can power custom use-cases like interactive tutorials. The price is that it\u2019s limited. You can\u2019t run, say, a python script in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAaron Jorbin\n\n4:57 pm on April 14, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nThe initial implementation of codespaces was introduced through #57187 and there is a ticketticket Created for both bug reports and feature development on the bug tracker. with some additional followup improvements #57896 if you want to follow along or contribute to this effort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLukasz\n\n1:16 pm on April 14, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately got an error on windows 10 when using the vs code extension:\ncommand \u2018wordpress-playground.iframePlayground\u2019 not found\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzieladam\n\n4:45 pm on April 14, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nThank you for reporting! It\u2019s not a hackathon project if it doesn\u2019t break \ud83d\ude42 I will look into that. Would you mind filing an issue in the Playground repo? https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-playground/issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLukasz\n\n5:38 pm on April 14, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nhaha of course!
