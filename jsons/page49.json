These heavy metals occur all around us, albeit in tiny quantities. But demand continues to rise and because they occur in such low concentrations, traditional methods of extracting REEs can be inefficient, environmentally polluting, and detrimental to the health of workers.\u00a0\u00a0Now, with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Environmental Microbes as a BioEngineering Resource (EMBER) program, San Diego State University researchers are developing advanced extraction methods with the aim of boosting the domestic supply of REEs.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe are trying to develop a new procedure for recovery which is environmentally friendly and more sustainable,\u201d said biologist and principal investigator Marina Kalyuzhnaya.\u00a0To do this, the researchers will tap into the natural propensity of methane-consuming bacteria living in extreme conditions to capture REEs from the environment.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThey require rare earth elements to make one of the key enzymatic reactions in their metabolic pathways,\u201d said Kalyuzhnaya.\u00a0REEs include the many lanthanide elements of the periodic table. In collaboration with the University of California, Berkeley and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), the SDSU researchers plan to reverse engineer the biological processes that allow the bacteria to harvest the metals from the environment. Understanding this process will inform the creation of synthetic designer proteins that bind with high specificity to different types of lanthanides, according to biochemist John Love. PNNL\u2019s team will identify the genetic determinants of the extremophilic and REE accumulating bacteria, and then characterize their REE uptake.\u00a0The team will then modify the bacteria to produce the metal-binding proteins on the surface of their cells, said Love.\u00a0REEs are relatively abundant in mine tailings, the waste products of some metal ores, such as aluminum.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cMine tailings are actually waste which still has a lot of useful materials in it,\u201d said Kalyuzhnaya.\u00a0To purify and collect the REEs within, these slurries of water and crushed rocks will be run through a biofilter containing the modified bacteria, allowing the designer proteins on the surface of the bacteria to selectively bind to the REEs. Like the methane-loving bacteria that served as their templates, the improved bacteria will tolerate extremes of pH, temperature and salinity, conditions found in the mine tailings.\u00a0\u00a0The researchers will collaborate with an industry partner,\u00a0Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), a Xerox company, to bioprint a porous, sorbent material for use in the biofilter. This bioprinting technology is low-cost and scalable and is projected to result in significant savings when applied broadly to mineral recovery.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to testing and optimizing the biofilter, the team will also have to develop methods for collecting the purified lanthanides from the biofilter itself, according to environmental engineer Christy Dykstra. The researchers have teamed up with a startup company,\u00a0Phoenix Tailings, to test and refine the recovery process.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Because the goal is to develop a commercially viable but environmentally friendly process for extracting REEs, Dykstra and several of the project partners will analyze the costs of the system compared with other technologies for recovering lanthanides, but also the environmental impact.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe do anticipate that it would have a lot of benefits environmentally and lower energy costs compared to what is currently used,\u201d said Dykstra. \u201cA system like this would be more of a passive biofiltration system, with less energy inputs. And then, theoretically, less use of really environmentally harmful solvents and things like that. A lot of current processes will use really harsh and non-environmentally friendly solvents.\u201d\u00a0Dykstra also notes that since bacteria replicate themselves, microbe-based technologies are self-renewing, \u201cwhereas if we were to use a chemical method, we would have to continually produce more and more chemical.\u201d\u00a0\u201cEven if it will cost a little bit more, but it does not harm the environment, that would make sense,\u201d said Kalyuzhnaya.\u00a0\u00a0The goal of the DARPA-funded project is to provide proof-of-concept of the bio-driven REE-recovery technology in four years, which Kalyuzhnaya said will require a strategic vision and a cross-disciplinary outlook.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She added that the project will provide SDSU graduate students with the opportunity to participate in multidisciplinary research \u201cand see how concepts can grow from just ideas all the way to pilot demonstration.\u201d\u00a0DARPA Approved for Public Release, Distribution Unlimited\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\nLatest Stories\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSDSU Team Awarded $10 Million Grant Over 5 years to Research Safer Streets for Pedestrians, Cyclists2023 SDSU Student Symposium Another SuccessSocial Determinants of Health Reflected in Geographical Analysis of COVID-19 DataSDSU Incubator Receives National Recognition for EntrepreneurshipDecoding the Brain: AWJ Winner Uncovers Phenomena Behind ReadingVIDEO: In a San Diego Community Garden, Public Impact Research BlossomsVIDEO: Learn, Discover and Innovate with Student ResearchThrough a Comics Lens, History and Social Justice Come AliveFinding The Toxic \u2018Needle In a Haystack\u2019In Her Words: Lessons from the LabMission to the MoonPrison Arts Collective: A Forum for Expression and Connection\n\n\nBROWSE ALL RELATED\n\n\n\n\nSeeman, Sato Named to All Mountain West TeamsSDSU Deepens Ties to OaxacaSDSU Wins Second Straight MW ChampionshipFour Aztecs Earn All-Mountain West HonorsSDSU's Class of 2023: Best Spots on Campus to Take Grad PhotosSDSU Imperial Valley Partnership Opens Doors to Higher Education for Foster YouthEducation Programs, Health Care Management Shine in New Graduate RankingsWater Polo: Legaspi and Valdes Earn GCC Postseason HonorsSDSU Educator Works to Improve Safety, Inclusion for LGBTQIA+ YouthAztec Baseball Collects Two MW Weekly HonorsEmployee Resource Group Sets Sights on a Broader ReachThe Road to SDSU\u2019s Senior Design Day 2023\n\n\nBROWSE ALL LATEST\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossing the Line\n\n\n                                                                \n                                                                Ongoing through Thursday, May 4, 2023, 4pm The San Diego State University School of Art and Design presents Crossing the Line at the University Art Gallery through Thursday, May 4, 2023.Crossing the Line features the artwork of 29 local artists, faculty, and alumni of the School of Art and Design, whose work examines the notion of boundaries and borders.
