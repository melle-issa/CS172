For over 50 years, BML\u2019s multidisciplinary research discoveries have advanced ocean and coastal health, and its hand-on educational programs have been training the nation\u2019s next generation of leaders in marine science and policy.\nHorseshoe Cove Webcam\n\n\n\tFor additional real-time conditions in Bodega Bay, CA see the Bodega Ocean Observing Node (BOON).\n\nPerched on the iconic bluffs of Bodega Head, on the Bodega Marine Reserve,\u00a0BML sits at the epicenter of one of only four coastal upwelling regions in the world \u2013 areas of extreme biological productivity \u2013 that are rich for research discoveries. The Laboratory is also adjacent to a State Marine Protected Area and two National Marine Sanctuaries, yet only 65 miles from San Francisco Bay, one of the most impacted estuaries in the world. BML offers a front-row seat in which to study the real-time impact of commercial, recreational, and residential activity along the coastline and to assess the effectiveness of current and future marine conservation efforts.\nBML is also the core research and educational facility of the\u00a0UC Davis Coastal and Marine Sciences Institute (CMSI), which links BML with the more than 70 marine science faculty from all across the UC Davis campus. CMSI unites and coordinates the multifaceted community of UC Davis marine researchers, including many from the social sciences arena, so that together they can identify the most effective strategies for sustaining our irreplaceable coastal environment. CMSI expands upon BML\u2019s strong foundation with new programs, including a popular Marine and Coastal Sciences undergraduate major and a new Marine Sciences Ph.D. program.\nOur Org Chart\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation for BML and BMR Users\nResident Students\nLocal resources for students living and studying at the Bodega Marine Laboratory\nVisiting Researchers\nFacilities and Services for Research\nHow to apply to use the Bodega Marine Laboratory\u00a0and Bodega Marine Reserve\nConference Groups\nMeeting spaces, services and accommodations\nJoin\u00a0the BML Community\nEmployment Opportunities\nVolunteer Opportunities\nJoin Our Mail Lists\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact BML\nEmail: ucdbml@ucdavis.edu\nP.O.
