If so, you should get acquainted with the International and Exchange Student Center in the University Student Union.\nCalifornia State University, Northridge\u2019s International and Exchange Student Center (IESC) in the Division of Student Affairs oversees multiple programs such as California State University International Programs (CSU-IP) and the National Student Exchange. The IESC engages and collaborates with CSUN community partners to achieve their mission, encourage the development of global citizens and enhance CSUN\u2019s reputation at home and abroad.\nStudy Abroad & National Student Exchange Advisor in the IESC, Rebecca Spector, explained that the office \u201cprovides services to newly admitted and continuing international F-1 and J-1 visa students, Fulbright students and participants of the study abroad program and National Student Exchange (NSE).\u201d Spector added that the office also provides other types of support. \u201cThe IESC also coordinates cultural and social events that allow our students to share their national heritage and get involved with the campus educational community.\u201d\nThe IESC also promotes scholarships for students who study abroad. These scholarships include the Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship and the Fund for Education Abroad (FEA) scholarship.\nFrom all of the programs they have to offer, the most popular one is the California State University International Program (CSU-IP). It offers students the opportunity to choose from 18 countries to visit and study abroad for either a year or a semester depending on which country is chosen. The 18 countries are Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Ghana, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. This program had over 150 applications submitted for 2022-23.\nSome of the benefits of studying abroad are discovering different cultures, developing a broader understanding of the world, self-discovery, establishing independence, learning from others, learning a foreign language, enhancing their resume and becoming a global citizen.\nHowever, traveling around the world is not effortless and some students encounter hurdles during their trip. Spector added, \u201cSome adjustments students encounter while traveling abroad are homesickness, language and cultural barriers, and dietary and health issues.\u201d The Study Abroad staff at CSUN, CSU-IP staff in Long Beach at the Chancellor\u2019s Office and the support staff in the country that the students are studying in help them navigate these adjustments by providing resources and additional guidance.\n\u201cOur office holds a mandatory pre-departure meeting where we discuss these topics and provide resources. We are also available to meet with students while they are abroad to help with any adjustments they are facing,\u201d Spector said. There is also onsite staff that helps students with resources to help combat these issues while abroad,\u201d Spector continued.\nFor more information about studying abroad or other opportunities, visit the International and Exchange Student Center.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Arts and Culture, CSUN, Education, International and Exchange Student Center, Students\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n\n\n\nNew Tech and a Sense of Community: CSUN\u2019s Assistive Technology Conference Celebrates 38 Years\n\n\nCSUN to host multimedia performance that explores climate change\n\n\n\u2018Ghosts\u2019 Stories: On a Hit TV Show, CSUN Alum Uses His Voice\n\n\nTribal Leader, Philanthropist and Acclaimed Author to Receive Honorary Doctorates from CSUN\n\n\nCSUN Showcase Throws Spotlight on Hollywood\u2019s Future Filmmakers\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u2190 New Tech and a Sense of Community: CSUN\u2019s Assistive Technology Conference Celebrates 38 Years\nCSUN Success Story: How Malachia Hoover\u2019s Time as a Matador Put Her on the Path to Saving Lives \u2192\n\n\n\n\n Top Stories\n\n\n\nFeatured Tag\n\n\n\n\n\n \u2018Ghosts\u2019 Stories: On a Hit TV Show, CSUN Alum Uses His Voice\non April 26, 2023in Alumni, Arts and Culture\n\n\n Tribal Leader, Philanthropist and Acclaimed Author to Receive Honorary Doctorates from CSUN\non April 25, 2023in Alumni, Community, CSU News, CSUN Events, Education, Faculty and Staff News, Graduation Ceremony, Honors & Awards, Media Releases, University News\n\n\n CSUN Breaks Ground on Autodesk Technology Engagement Center, a Project with National Impact\non April 24, 2023in Donor Profile, Giving\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCSU Resources CSU Leader\nCSYouCSU News\n\nTopicsArts and Culture\nAthletics\nBusiness\nCommunity\nCSU News\nEducation\nFaculty and Staff News\nHealth and Fitness\nMedia Releases\nPolitics and Society\nScience and Technology\n CSUN in the News\n\nCalifornia State University Northridge President Dr. Erika D.
