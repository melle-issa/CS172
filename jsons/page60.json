Law Students How to Hang Their Own Shingle Fowler School of Law launching JD entrepreneurship certificate.\n Joy JuedesFebruary 22, 20235 min read\n\n\nSean Bigley (JD \u201913) thought he wanted to go into politics.\nHe went to college in Washington, D.C., was an investigator for the Department of Defense and worked at the White House.\n\u201cI had a colorful pre-law school career,\u201d he says.\nBigley, who also was a police officer for a short time, eventually decided he wanted to be his own boss.\nSean Bigley \u201913.\nFamily business\n\u201cI had a lot of lawyers in the family and they said it\u2019s a great thing to be able to have a professional practice where you can hang out your own shingle \u2013 be a doctor, lawyer, dentist, whatever,\u201d says Bigley, director of Chapman University Fowler School of Law\u2019s new entrepreneurship certificate program. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be wanting for work.\u201d\nSome of those family members, including Bigley\u2019s father, entered professions with the option of having their own practices because Bigley\u2019s grandfather was laid off a few years before he could collect a pension from a company where he\u2019d worked for decades.\n\u201cHe had to work side jobs to help make ends meet and there was a period of several years where times were tight for the family,\u201d Bigley says.\n\u201cI grew up hearing those stories about how entrepreneurship is so valuable because you are never going to be in a position where someone else dictates your ability to put food on the table. And so for me, that was something that I always had in the back of my head.\u201d\nThe idea of entrepreneurship \u201ccrystallized\u201d for him while he put himself through Fowler School of Law.\n\u201cI had a professor who \u2013 I will never forget \u2013 made a comment, \u2018Niches make riches.\u2019 And I thought, OK, maybe this is somebody\u2019s way of telling me to just take the leap of faith.\u201d\nBigley did, opening his own practice immediately after graduating from Fowler School of Law. He parlayed his experience doing government security clearance investigations into a \u201cgap in the market.\u201d\nAt first, he wasn\u2019t making money and second-guessed his decision. But eventually, \u201csomething clicked\u201d and two years after graduating he was making more than his classmates who joined big firms, he says.\nHis firm \u2013 which he is retiring from after a decade to run the entrepreneurship program \u2013\u00a0 represents people around the world applying for government security clearance. It grew into a five-attorney partnership with employees in three states.\n\u201cI always tell people, I got a phenomenal legal education at Chapman,\u201d Bigley says. \u201cBut for me, the missing piece was that business acumen because that wasn\u2019t a background that I had, and so I had to teach it all to myself. And I know that I\u2019m not alone in that.\u201d\nKnowing how to run a business\nThe California State Bar calls attorneys in solo or small-firm practice its \u201cbackbone.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to know how to run a business,\u201d Bigley says.\nTo that end, the entrepreneurship program \u2013 which officially starts in fall 2023 \u2013 will offer two tracks:\u00a0\n\nSolo and small firm practice: For the JD student who contemplates opening their own practice or who seeks to add value to an existing small firm. Students will receive practice-oriented instruction in the legal issues solo and small firm practitioners often encounter. Students will also learn the \u201cbusiness of law\u201d and how to succeed as entrepreneurs.\nAdvising and representing entrepreneurs: For the JD student interested in advising and representing start-ups and small business owners. Students will receive practice-oriented instruction in the legal issues commonly encountered by non-attorney entrepreneurs. Students will also learn basic tenets of business and personal finance.\n\nBigley, who has already taught an entrepreneurship-related course at Fowler School of Law along with another attorney, says there has been \u201can overwhelmingly positive sign of initial student interest even though the emphasis program itself hasn\u2019t started.\u201d\n\u201cThere has been about a quarter of the entire third-year class in just those two classes. To me, that is a huge sign of what I think this program will become.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been said the legal market is saturated, but Bigley says students can get a great return on their JD investment by having a niche practice and knowing opportunities \u2013 especially if they worked in another field before law school.\n\u201cInvesting in entrepreneurship is not only an investment in our students, but it\u2019s also an investment in the value of the school for the long haul. We\u2019re showing students that we are committing as a school to your success and your opportunities post-graduation,\u201d he says.\nOne thing that could be added down the road is an incubator for Chapman law alumni who want to start their own practice.\nNo matter what, students will have foundational business knowledge to go with their law degree, he says.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you find yourself laid off or you find yourself tired of working for that boss you don\u2019t like, or you need some flexibility because you want to stay at home with a child or you don\u2019t want to practice in a traditional firm setting, this gives you options,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re never going to be wanting for work when you can go out and create your own opportunities. And to me, the best gift we can give our students is options.\u201d\n\n\ncertificate Dale E.
