Submitted to the CSU by the California State Student Association (CSSA), the fee creates a more stable, independent, and expanded statewide student association. Through a $2 per-term voluntary fee assessed to each CSU student, this new funding model will replace CSSA's long-standing revenue sources that included Associated Students membership dues, fundraising, and Chancellor's Office grants.\nWhat is CSSA?\nCSSA is a non-profit student organization founded by student body presidents in 1959. Recognized by the CSU Trustees as the official voice of CSU students, CSSA has long advocated for student access to an affordable, high quality CSU education. CSSA student leaders work with the CSU Chancellor, CSU Trustees, Governor, and State Legislature to positively affect higher education policy in California.\nTo learn more about what programs CSSA offers and what kind of activities the organization engages in, please visit the CSSA website\u00a0\u00a0or phone (562) 951-4377.\nWill Financial Aid cover this $2 fee?\nIf your financial aid award is sufficient to pay all of your registration charges, the SIRF will be paid by your financial aid when it disburses to your student account.\nHow do I opt out?\nThe deadline to opt out of the fee is the census date for each term which is listed on the Academic Calendar. After the census date, students will no longer be able to opt out for the semester and the fee is non-refundable after the census date for each term. If a student chooses to, they will need to opt out each semester. Students can opt out through their Student Center after they register for classes by clicking \"Account Inquiry\" and selecting the \"Activity\" tab along the top. The \"SIRF\" is the only fee that is non-mandatory and has the option to opt out.\nHow to Opt Out of the Student Involvement & Representation Fee\nStep 1. To OPT OUT of\u00a0 the SIRF fee, log into your Online Services, select MySSU, click on \"Student Center\".\n\u00a0\nStep 2. Select \u201cAccount Inquiry\u201d listed under \u201cFinances.\"\u00a0\n\nStep 3. Within Account Inquiry, click the activity tab.\nThis itemized list of charges will include the Student Involvement Rep Fee.\nClick the \u00a0\u00a0\"information button.\" The information button brings up a detailed description of the fee.\nIf you would like to opt out, click the OPT OUT icon \u00a0\u00a0from the charge list.\n\nStep 4. Click the Activity Tab. The $2 credit will appear on the \"Activity\" page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeawolf Services\n\nSeawolf Service Center Home\nC\u00f3mo Comunicarse\nStudent Charges/FeesDescription of Fees\nDescription of Fees (Spanish)\nSIRF\nStudent Financial Responsibility Agreement\nFees - Current & Past\n\nPayment Due Dates/Methods\nFERPA\n1098-T FAQ\nHousing - REACH\nParking Permit & Information\nTravel\nCampus Keys\nPetty Cash\nMaintenance Work Orders\nCheck Pickup\nLost & Found\nNotary\nSeawolf Card\nForms\nStaff Directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSU Facebook\nSSU Twitter\nSSU Instagram\nSSU Youtube\nSSU News RSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Ave\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n707.664.2880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact SSU\nPrivacy Notice\nCalifornia State University\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSafeSSU\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\nEmergency Information\nJobs\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
