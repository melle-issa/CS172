This requires continuous user testing and feedback to improve functionality and user experience.\n  * Collaboration and communication are crucial for plugin development: Plugin development is a team effort that requires effective communication, collaboration, and project management.

They discuss finding the balance in the small and big pictures of product development, highlighting the process of trial and error.\n\nTop Takeaways\n\n  * Courage Under Fire. After what feels like a miserable failure, it\u2019s vital to keep trudging forward. Great product design takes time to build and grow in the space you are putting it into. Keeping your passion alive and remaining consistent in your efforts will eventually lead you to success.\n  * The Impact of Thoughtful Design. Developing a product is of course based on meeting some kind of user need, but it\u2019s important to consider if you are really going to make that user\u2019s life easier with your product. When the end user is your top priority, your product will shine, and you\u2019ll be proud of the direct impact you made in someone\u2019s everyday life.\n  * Finding the Spark in Your Product. Focusing on the overall product journey is key for great product development, but zooming in on the minor details is also just as important. Brainstorming and finding the spark is not easy, but it is crucial to set your product apart from the rest.\n  * Using Your Audience to Improve Development. Put your ideas and questions out there for your audience to speak to. If you are wondering how people will perceive a certain product aspect or want more information on what their exact pain points are, it\u2019s good to directly ask. Getting information straight from your customers or peers can help you make well-informed decisions in product development.\ud83d\udd17 Mentioned in the show:\n\n  * Crop.Express\n  * StickerMule\ud83d\udc26 You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:\n\n  * Corey Maass\n  * Cory Miller (CEO, Post Status)\n  * Olivia Bisset (Intern, Post Status)\n\nThe Post Status Draft podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. \ud83d\udcdd\n\nBrowse our archives, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe via iTunes, Google Podcasts, YouTube, Stitcher, Simplecast, or RSS. \ud83c\udfa759 minplaylist_addMar 23, 2023Corey & Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live - Session 6Learn from Corey Maass, a master of WordPress plugins and apps, and Cory Miller, a marketing, business, and WordPress experience guru. The two discuss the intimacies of partnering on a product and how solopreneurs can benefit from support.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * The Value of Partnerships. Starting a business can be a lonely experience. Having someone to bounce ideas off, talk through tough subjects with, and celebrate successes with makes a significant difference. Having that collaborative support system can make managing a business more enjoyable and streamlined, which is a huge benefit, especially for startups and small businesses.\n  * Discussion vs. Decision. It\u2019s important to be intentional with communication considering the stage you are in when you are improving a product or creating something brand new. Being vocal about whether you are still discussing or whether you are ready to make decisive moves is critical to keep the process moving forward without missteps.\n  * The Art of Failing. Understanding that taking risks and being willing to fail in order to ultimately achieve success is key for solopreneurs and partnerships. Quantifying your success rate on projects isn\u2019t the ultimate indicator of how successful you truly are. Stumbling through a myriad of shortcomings while still pursuing success is powerful.\ud83d\udd17 Mentioned in the show:\n\n  * Crop.Express\n  * Elementor\n  * Beaver Builder\ud83d\udc26 You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:\n\n  * Corey Maass\n  * Cory Miller (CEO, Post Status)\n  * Olivia Bisset (Intern, Post Status)\n\nThe Post Status Draft podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. \ud83d\udcdd\n\nBrowse our archives, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe via iTunes, Google Podcasts, YouTube, Stitcher, Simplecast, or RSS. \ud83c\udfa736 minplaylist_addMar 15, 2023Post Status Live \u2013 The Right Approach to WordPress AccessibilityThe talented team from Modern Tribe joined Cory Miller for this critical discussion about accessibility in WordPress. They highlight accessibility as a non-negotiable aspect of web development and provide guidance for leaders, developers, and designers to ensure your websites are accessible to all people.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * Why Value Accessibility? Accessibility ensures all people have access to the things we create. It can\u2019t be an afterthought or something for the web dev team to figure out. It must drive the entire creative process and serve as an anchor to ground our teams and our work.\n  * Requirement vs. Challenge. Most creative projects work within a set of requirements. These don\u2019t prohibit the creative process. Instead, they challenge us to enhance the things we build and make them better than we might have without thinking through and within these constraints.\n  * It\u2019s All Around Us. We think of accessibility as a new idea, but in so many spaces, it\u2019s the norm. We have curb cutouts and braille signage. We see this every day, so tech is catching up.\n  * Improving Usability. Developing through the lens of accessibility means delivering experiences that solve people\u2019s problems and help them with tasks.\n  * It Takes Tools. The creative and engineering are just rails. Utilizing tools to ensure accessibility when publishing and setting up processes and guidelines will equip you to flex as requirements change. It\u2019s necessary for your organization to resource accessibility for it to be done effectively.\ud83d\udd17 Mentioned in the show:\n\n  * Modern Tribe\n  * Eric Meyer\n  * MySpace\ud83d\udc26 You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:\n\n  * Chris Kindred (Director of Backend Development, Modern Tribe)\n  * Sarah Gless (Creative Director, Modern Tribe)\n  * Mike Klanac (Director of Business Development, Modern Tribe)\n  * Cory Miller (CEO, Post Status)\n  * Olivia Bisset (Intern, Post Status)\n\nThe Post Status Draft podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. \ud83d\udcdd\n\nBrowse our archives, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe via iTunes, Google Podcasts, YouTube, Stitcher, Simplecast, or RSS. \ud83c\udfa71 hr 32 minplaylist_addMar 15, 2023Corey & Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live - Session 5As the development of Crop.Express continues, Cory Miller and Corey Maass continue to gain clarity on what is needed for their product to succeed. They discuss features and integration, free vs. paid versions, ensuring compatibility, and more, as they fold in their experience, expertise, and gathered feedback into the future strategy of their product business.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * Cultivating empathy is important for developers. It's essential to understand the needs of different users, particularly those who are not very tech-savvy or who come from different cultural backgrounds. Empathy helps create products that are more user-friendly and accessible to a broader audience.\n  * Collaboration is crucial for success. No matter how brilliant a product developer is, they can't do everything on their own. They need a team of people with different skills and backgrounds to support them, whether it's in terms of design, marketing, or other areas. Building a supportive team requires humility and a willingness to accept feedback and help from others.\n  * Failure is a necessary part of growth. Many product developers go through a difficult experience where they realize that their work isn't as good as they thought it was. This experience can be humbling, but it's also an opportunity to learn and grow. It's important for developers to be open to feedback, to take risks, and to be willing to try new things, even if it means making mistakes along the way.\ud83d\udd17 Mentioned in the show:\n\n  * Sticker Mule\n  * Canva\n  * Kickstarter\n  * Unsplash\n  * Stock Unlimited\ud83d\udc26 You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:\n\n  * Corey Maass\n  * Cory Miller (CEO, Post Status)\n  * Olivia Bisset (Intern, Post Status)\n\nThe Post Status Draft podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. \ud83d\udcdd\n\nBrowse our archives, and don\u2019t forget to subscribe via iTunes, Google Podcasts, YouTube, Stitcher, Simplecast, or RSS. \ud83c\udfa71 hr 22 minplaylist_addMar 10, 2023Corey & Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live - Session 4In this episode, Corey Maass and Cory Miller focus on preparing Crop.Express for launch. They discuss building launch assets, utilizing a freemium model as a path toward a premium product, and future possibilities.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * Value of a Soft Launch. This is a great way to test the waters and get initial feedback. If you utilize a soft launch, you need to be willing to make changes and improvements based on that feedback before you fully launch.\n  * Building a Sustainable Premium Product. Start by setting up a basic website and integration to attract customers. Establishing a freemium model allows you to identify what users will value enough to pay for and provides space for your plugin to become a recommended tool for users, agencies, and hosting providers as a premium product.\n  * Feedback as Fuel. Gathering input from customers and agency owners in the WordPress ecosystem can help you understand the barriers to adoption, like already established workflows, the challenge of\u20261 hr 32 minplaylist_addMar 9, 2023Interview With Product Lead Brandon Dove Of Pixel JarBrandon Dove, co-founder of Pixel Jar, joins Cory Miller to discuss his WordPress plugin, AdSanity Plugin. They dive into the nuance of advertising, evaluate the benefits of free and paid plugins, and talk through the challenges and opportunities available to agencies who invest in product development while providing other services.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * Recurring Product Revenue. While it can be challenging for an agency to balance custom service work with product development, having a product that generates recurring revenue can provide a cushion and diversify the overall business revenue. AdSanity is a successful example of this, and the team is working on dedicating more resources towards the product to even out development between the two sides of their business. However, it can be difficult to maintain free plugins without generating revenue, and it's important to consider how to incorporate them into the business model.\n  * Value vs. Spam in Advertising. For many people, advertis\u202626 minplaylist_addMar 3, 2023Brian Gardner On WordPress Now And Today, Talking Design And Workflows, Full Site Editing, Gutenberg And BeyondBrian Gardner initially found WordPress as a blogger. His journey led him to found Studio Press which eventually became part of WPEngine. Brian and Cory flashback into what was and lean into the potential future of WordPress.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * Workflow Education. Getting adoption for workflows can be challenging. Agencies may resist changes to their workflow even if the change may bring significant benefits. Investing in education is key. Contributing to WordPress education by testing things and hosting workshops and demonstrations can ensure the project as a whole succeeds.\n  * Scaling is the Safety of WordPress. Many of the page builder softwares are not built for much beyond brochure-type sites. The extensibility of WordPress makes so much possible for businesses looking to deliver excellent customer experience or expand their site capabilities.\n  * Competition vs. Cooperation. Today there is far more competition in WordPress. In the early days, competition existed alongside coop\u202648 minplaylist_addMar 3, 2023Corey & Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live - Session 3In this episode, Corey Maass and Cory Miller share the results of submitting their WordPress plugin, Crop.Express to the repo. As they continue to build their product live, they develop branding, messaging, and strategy to validate their business and cultivate an audience.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * Expanding Outwards. Repo offers inherent discoverability for WordPress products, but cultivating broader awareness is necessary for a product to succeed. Creating brand assets, a website, and a newsletter create conduits for growth.\n  * Feel Out Your Brand. Be cautious not to box yourself in with branding. Consider what feeling you want people to get when using your product. Go a little deeper and have a little fun exploring the solutions and feelings you hope to offer as you create your branding. Move from literal to conception to better understand what defines your business.\n  * Ring the Bell. Identify your customer\u2019s problem and keep talking about it. Invite ideal users to talk about it.

Together they work through enhancing UX, selecting the right business model, crafting marketing messages, and more.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * Work Out the Workflow. You will teach people how to use your product with demos or tutorials. While you want to make adjustments to improve UX, you don\u2019t want to constantly change the workflows for your product. Being thoughtful on the front end can result in better usability and less change.\n  * Business Models. Building a product also means determining a business model. Offering some functionality for free can gain exposure for a base product. Adding a pro or paid version with increased value to deliver a better end product for a customer.\n  * Focus on Feedback. As a product builder, you work to anticipate pain points and solve for them. With a quality product, you will solve real struggles for users. But there is a reaso\u20261 hr 11 minplaylist_addFeb 23, 2023Interview With Product Lead Mark Westguard Of WS FormLearn from Mark Westguard, founder of WS Form, a powerful, next-generation WordPress form plugin. Mark and Cory discuss how AI is starting to integrate into the world of WordPress and how the WP Form software is leveraging its power.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * Harnessing the Power of Open AI. The possibilities are endless with the revolution of AI as an open-source tool. Making the most of its capabilities allows WordPress users to create more intuitive and integrated content, like better fields and options in WordPress forms.\n  * Create, Edit, Moderate. AI should be seen as an assistant working alongside you to help generate your content. You\u2019re still essential in the creation process, and it\u2019s important not to rely on AI 100% for accuracy. You can get creative prompts, edit for grammar or spelling and generate unique images, but moderating that content is essential.\n  * The Future is All-in-One AI Integrated Tools.

This core value has shaped Arnas\u2019 career path, from his roots in customer service to creating products to provide simple website restoration and security for principal vulnerabilities.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\nCustomer Obsession. Users are facing daily challenges that need real-time solutions. Think about their problems. Value their feedback. Sometimes clients are limited because we haven\u2019t kept up with the speed of evolving technology. Approaching things from a user perspective to prioritize and build products creates optimal impact.\n\nRemoving Manual Work.

Developers don\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel. With such a large ecosystem of products, finding a secret niche spot to develop your product isn\u2019t always the best or even attainable solution. Doing something better than the next company is sometimes all it takes for great success.\n  * The David and Goliath Struggle. It\u2019s obvious that there has always been and will continue to be an unbalanced level of success between independent WordPress product owners and large companies. But that\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t room for everyone; there is. An independent startup can move much faster into achieving short-term goals and growth than large-scale established companies can with a heavier workload and slower forward movement.\n  *\u202642 minplaylist_addFeb 3, 2023The WP Agency Journey with Bradford Campeau-Laurion of Alley Interactive \u2014 Post Status Draft 139In 2001 Bradford Campeau-Laurion began his career in publishing technology at Forbes Magazine, which evolved into utilizing WordPress in the enterprise market. Today he leads Alley Interactive, an agency focused on publishers, non-profits, museums, and brands. Brad shares his extensive experience in publishing technology and his view of the strengths and challenges within the enterprise market of WordPress.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * Shifting to Paywall Content. Perhaps a major misstep in early online publishing was setting the expectation of free content. Now print subscriptions are down. Publishers can\u2019t secure advertising without extremely high volume. And consumers are hesitant to pay for online subscriptions.\n  * WordPress Creator Economies. Within WordPress there are software and content creators. Software creators the directory to serve as a centralized community and marketplace. Content creators face a bigger challenge to find their market because there isn\u2019t a collaboration tool\u202650 minplaylist_addJan 26, 2023The WP Agency Journey With Mario Peshev Of DevriX \u2014 Post Status Draft 138Mario Peshev had an interest in technology from childhood. After working as a software developer, he transitioned into WordPress and founded his own agency, DevriX. They coined the term \u201cWordPress retainer.\u201d It is the mantra fueling their operations and one they hope other agencies will adopt. He joins Cory Miller to dive deep into the how and why of WordPress retainers, sharing his experience and his hopes for the future of WordPress.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * WordPress Retainers: Business doesn\u2019t have to be feast or famine. Several other industries utilize retainers because they provide consistent revenue and secure client commitment for ongoing work. The entire world is living around monthly costs. Not aligning your service-based business with that model is counterintuitive. Essentially it is just selling hours in bulk, turning services into products. Allotting 10% for project management while using the rest to prioritize and execute projects.

This is only the beginning of their process and partnership, but it\u2019s loaded with experience and insight from the journeys they have had within WordPress that brought them to this moment, as well as takeaways they\u2019ve discovered with their new undertaking.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * The Power of Partnering: Many entrepreneurs aren\u2019t interested in partnership. But they create an opportunity to own and contribute the things you do well alongside someone who has other skill sets, strengths, and experiences. Partnerships offer space to practice open dialogue while showing respect and gaining perspective. They are a great solution for all the things you can\u2019t do, don\u2019t want to do, or shouldn\u2019t do.\n  * Build for a Need: Sometimes we create things belie\u20261 hr 15 minplaylist_addJan 19, 2023Interview With Product Lead Tiffany Bridge At NexcessTiffany Bridge has been working in WordPress almost since the beginning of WordPress.

They dive into optimizing UX in WordPress, the benefits of open source, and more.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * WooCommerce Simplified with Store Builder. As you know, WordPress and WooCommerce love to hide settings in layers of menus. Nexcess saw the struggles people had in trying to set up eCommerce sites and created StoreBuilder as an easy tool to go from zero to having an online store. This removes the initial learning curve required to get started in Woo and sets up a DIY tool for merchants.\n  * A Platform to Grow with You: One of the great things about setting people up on WordPress and Woo as they start businesses is the flexibility available for future growth.

Together they look at what is currently possible within the world of integration and automation within WordPress. Then they lean into what is unfolding as Open AI finds its way into the mainstream and discuss what this might mean for the WordPress community.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * Integrations & Automations to Save Time: Everyone is in need of some kind of automation. Our main goal is to save time by creating automations wherever there are pain points. Rather than doing things manually, WP Webhooks enables you to automate them within your dashboard.\n  * Avoiding Automation through Software: Using software as a service partner means hosting your data on their platforms. Using Webhooks for integration and automation allows you to keep things on your server and within your complete control.\n  * Possibilities with Open AI Integration: Webhooks is\u202635 minplaylist_addJan 6, 2023Support Inclusion in Tech with Winstina Hughes \u2014 Post Status Draft 136Winstina Hughes is a long-term community member and organizer within WordPress. She joins Cory Miller to discuss Support Inclusion in Tech, an effort to increase representation of minority and underrepresented speakers at WordCamp by providing needed financial support. This offers everyone in the WordPress community the chance to share their expertise and to contribute resources, so everyone has the opportunity to engage.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * Creativity is our common bond.: WordPress is the playground where we all came to tinker and build for fun or business. It is the software magic where we discover what new things we can do each day, how to make ideas become reality, and how we might leverage what we learn to create a better world.\n  * Ripple effect of inclusion: When you provide the ability for a large group of people to participate, travel, and network, the impact extends beyond the WordPress community to create the bigger changes we want to see in the world. This is our community\u202650 minplaylist_addJan 6, 2023On The Fediverse, WordPress, And Activity Pub With Matthias Pfefferle \u2014 Post Status Draft 135In this episode, Cory Miller talks with Matthias Pfefferle, creator of Activity Pub, about the growing potential for decentralization through innovation within WordPress. Current social networks have stripped creators of agency and power. The threat has been more acutely felt with the recent transitions within Twitter. Recognizing what is at stake and moving towards innovation could not only create needed solutions but could also propel the future of WordPress.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * Decentralization: So much of the power of WordPress is rooted in decentralization. The silos created by social media platforms leave users without agency. The potential and appetite for decentralization is increasing along with the tools to make it a reality via the Fediverse, Activity Pub, and more.\n  * Portable Social Networks: If you are blocked or banned from a major social network, you lose your content and contacts.

Their work contributes to the businesses they serve, winning big and experiencing new levels of growth from the unique solutions they bring. From hearing about her background as a natural problem solver to her experiences engaging client needs with creative solutions, you will be inspired to break through limitations into the land of possibility.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * Building for Nuance: North UX likes to hone in on what makes a business really unique and find solutions to highlight those things so they are experienced as an asset instead of a detractor.\n  * Problem Solving Spiral: Poking around, asking questions, and figuring out ways to develop solutions spiraled Krissie from seeing and experiencing challenges to being a solution-building developer.

She and her husband have worked in WordPress for over a decade and run a small, consultative agency. D'nelle shares truly helpful insights about centering relationships in work and life. From being invested in clients for the long haul to being intentionally curious about knowing others and how they spend their days, D'nelle invites us to let connection be the fuel that informs and inspires who we are and how we work.\n\nTop Takeaways:\n\n  * Build Long-Term Client Relationships: Building long-term relationships enables you to advise clients from a big-picture perspective, as opposed to just building technical solutions.\n  * Support is Serious Business: Doing what we do best should give our client's peace of mind that their sites will perform as needed when needed.\n  * Look Beyond a Client's Ask to Unseen Opportunities: As clearly reflected in D'nelle's experience share about her yo\u202636 minplaylist_addNov 18, 2022Tom Willmot on the Challenges and Opportunities Facing Enterprise WordPress \u2014 Post Status Draft 130Tom Willmot has been a WordPress pioneer and leader in the agency space since co-founding Human Made in 2010. Just in the past year, Human Made has more than doubled its size with a team of 100. Tom is also CEO and co-founder of Altis DXP, Human Made's enterprise WordPress digital experience platform. I caught up with Tom this week to find out what he's thinking about the challenges and opportunities of the enterprise market for WordPress agencies today.\n\nSparked by Magne Ilsaas's ideas in The WordPress Enterprise Paradox, Tom started a Twitter thread and hosted a live discussion this week about the challenges of not having a well-defined brand and market for enterprise WordPress. In the minds of clients beyond the WordPress and open-source community not to mention unhelpful tech industry analysts, \"WordPress\" is something you can buy, and it's often confused with any number of related brands: Automattic, WordPress VIP, and managed WordPress hosts that support enterprise clients.\n\nAfte\u202652 minplaylist_addNov 11, 2022WordPress in the Long View with James Farmer \u2014 Post Status Draft 129In this episode of Post Status Draft, Cory is joined by James Farmer, CEO of Incsub, WPMU DEV, CampusPress, and Edublogs.

Edublogs currently hosts millions of students\u2019 and educators\u2019 blogs. James talks about successes and failures, his views on Gutenberg, and how he stays competitive with Squarespace.

Along with WordPress, any combination of plugins and themes can be included. There\u2019s GitHub integration, and InstaWP has the ability to push sites to a large number of hosts or pull them to a local development environment. (InstaWP generates Blueprints \u2014 .zip packages for WP Engine\u2019s Local app.)\n\nInstaWP is being embraced by WordPress product developers and agencies. It has significant product testing and marketing applications since customers can spin up any number of demo sites based on a custom template, and this activity is logged. Vikas has picked up seed funding from Automattic and looks forward to announcing many new partnerships with WordPress businesses that have found InstaWP and valuable and complementary tool.\n\nVikas sees InstaWP\u2019s future as a marketplace for agencies, developer\u202637 minplaylist_addOct 28, 2022To Heck with Black Friday, I\u2019m Raising My Prices! \u2014 Post Status Draft 127Transcript \u2193\n\nThis week in Post Status Slack, Lesley Sim, the founder of Newsletter Glue, dropped this announcement:\n\n\"While everybody is offering discounts for Black Friday, we\u2019re planning to significantly raise prices. We\u2019ll be narrowing our target audience and focusing mainly on medium-large publishers and online businesses; working with them more closely and providing a high level of customization and support.\"\n\nWhat motivated Lesley's decision? Where does she expect it to take her company?\n\nFor some background, listen to my recent conversation with Till Kr\u00fcss, whose business model for Object Cache Pro and conversations following from it were part of Lesley's thinking about her own product.\n\nIn this conversation with Lesley, we talk about:\n\nPay attention to the shape of your market and your pricing.\n\nLesley Sim\n\n  * Lesley's experience with Black Friday sales tactics.\n  * \"Lifetime\" memberships and licenses.\n  * Where Newsletter Glue started and how its pricing model has cha\u202658 minplaylist_addOct 27, 2022Post Status Excerpt (No. 72) \u2014 Can We Get to \"Yes\" on Better UX?Can We Get to \u201cYes\u201d on Better UX?\n\nWhat does WordPress need to do to appeal more to do-it-yourself website builders and creators who are trying to take a business, hobby, or side project online? This week in an article he shared in Post Status Slack, Eric Karkovack suggested some ways to improve the WordPress user experience, especially for DIY users setting up a website for the first time.\n\nWe also have lists of plugins we disrecommend \u2014 to the point that it's a dealbreaker if a client insists on using them. And of course, these lists change a lot over time.\n\nWe all know these things \u2014 but it's a kind of \u201copen secret\u201d within professional WordPress circles. That's understandable! Comparison is the thief of joy \u2014 and possibly revenue.\n\nSome of the things Eric wants to see happen, like a standard interface for plugins and a curated view of the plugin ecosystem, are similar to views commonly expressed by designers, developers, and people in other professional roles at WordPr\u202640 minplaylist_addOct 21, 2022Post Status Excerpt (No. 71) \u2014 Building, Supporting, and Selling a Winning Product \u2014 With or Without\u00a0WordPress.orgThis week I sat down again with Eric Karkovack to talk about the three top WordPress stories on the top of our minds. Independently, we made nearly the same selections! It seems the temporary loss of active install stats at WP.org has created an opportunity to rethink long-held assumptions and find new ways forward. Our news picks are all related to this in one way or another. So there's a single throughline in this episode \u2014 what works, what doesn't, and what will take WordPress businesses forward in the product, agency, and hosting spaces.Are Active Install Counts Irrelevant to Your Plugin Business's Success? (Even if they were accurate?)\n\nThere are always going to be developers who push the envelope when it comes to littering the dashboard and just making it a difficult user experience. Maybe data is part of the way we solve that.\n\nEric Karkovac\n\nFirst up is Alex Denning's article at Ellipsis, \"WordPress.org is ineffective for plugin distribution in 2022.\" Alex argues the likely t\u202644 minplaylist_addOct 14, 2022Till Kr\u00fcss on Object Cache Pro, WordPress, plugins, testing, and performance \u2014 Post Status Draft 126Back in August, I had a long conversation with Till Kr\u00fcss (edited down to <60 minutes here) about his path into WordPress, Laravel, and performance. Till is the developer and owner of Object Cache Pro, \"a business class Redis object cache backend for WordPress.\" OCP offers a unique and highly successful model for partnerships between a WordPress plugin product business and a valuable niche market: hosting companies and anyone running WordPress sites at scale. Nexcess is the latest host to adopt OCP, which they announced earlier this week.\n\nTill\u2019s particular niche is not for everyone, but some of his ideas and achievements are very portable. For one thing, what plugin owner has not felt the pain of an extraordinarily busy support forum? Till is up to (wait for it..) 5-10 _minutes_ a day on support \u2014 which he aims to decrease. How?

Their conversation focuses on accessibility and disability. Ny had an experience with Uber at WCUS that made her agree with Dan's preference for traditional and preferably unionized taxi companies or public transit. They both reflect on the accessibility challenges and failures Michelle Frechette shared in Five Days Without a Shower before turning to an important article by Piccia Neri that was published at Post Status this week.\n\nPiccia's article considers the value of salary transparency in hiring and job listings after asking WordPress employers why they _don't_ advertise a salary range in listings.

Kim started building a career in WordPress over ten years ago, and her agency, Valet, is almost that old. WordPress isn't a small village community anymore, says Kim, but we still talk about it as if it is. That tightly knit community is still there because \u2014 not in spite of \u2014 incredible growth. But what does the fact of growth mean for a small village culture? Can it turn into an enclave or cult? Is the language of a small village still an appropriate language for leadership? Do we need to act more like we're a busy city \u2014 and make an effort to get to know our newer neighbors' stories? Can we keep (let alone scale) the values, culture, and kindness of a healthy small community as we grow?\ud83d\ude4f Sponsor: WP Engine\n\nWP Engine is the WordPress Digital Experience Platform that drives your business forward faster.

Is a small decline something to be concerned about or more of an opportunity to examine what defines WordPress as a successful platform?

Cal explains the basics of Docker and Lando \u2014 as well as the advantages of using them. Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It can work with Lando to automate your development workflow.\n\nWhy This Matters: Developers \u2014 both individually and in teams \u2014 are building more complex applications with (and for) WordPress, so the software stack is getting more complex. How you setup your environment (local, cloud, or both) is becoming more important, and developers should educate themselves on the available options \u2014 especially with popular choices being explored by PHP developers.\n\nEvery week Post Status Excerpt will bring you important news and insights from guests working in the WordPress space. \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\u202630 minplaylist_addApr 28, 2022Post Status Excerpt \u2014 BlackPress: Bringing More Creators into the WordPress Community\u201cOrganizers running meetups wherever they may be \u2014 your first thought should be how I can make this inclusive for everyone?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Niesha Sweet\n\nIn this conversation for Post Status Excerpt, David is joined by Destiny Fox, Niesha Sweet, and Allie Nimmons to talk about BlackPress. BlackPress exists \"to bring more creators of Black African descent into the WordPress Community\" and to provide this part of the community with a network for support and learning. Find out how BlackPress got started and how the WordPress community (from meetup organizers to businesses) can help their cause.\n\nWhy This Matters: It\u2019s important in the WordPress community that we make sure all kinds of people feel welcome and can contribute. By supporting and learning how BlackPress strengthens the community, we can apply that knowledge in our own way and do the same.\n\nEvery week Post Status Excerpt will bring you important news and insights from guests working in the WordPress space. \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\nYou can listen\u202625 minplaylist_addApr 20, 2022Post Status Excerpt \u2014 A New Era of WordPress Themes\u201cA style is the design language for a theme.\u201d \u2014Rich Tabor\n\nIn this episode, David Bisset talks with someone who has moved the WordPress theme needle a long way: Rich Tabor. Rich believes the arrival of the Full Site Editing experience in WordPress 5.9 is the biggest innovation since themes emerged. Speaking from the experience of creating blocks and block themes, Rich explains how Full Site Editing will change WordPress's identity.\n\nWhy This Matters: WordPress professionals need to be familiar with more than just just \u201cblocks.\u201d There are block themes, styles, and more features that have already arrived in the WordPress editor.

WordPress professionals have a lot to keep track of, so it's not surprising they often overlook important news from the PHP community and development team. To bring you up to speed, David Bisset speaks with Carl Alexander and Tonya Mork in this episode of The Excerpt. Tonya and Carl have been deep into WordPress and PHP for many years. Here they offer a \"Cliffs Notes\" take on the PHP news the WordPress community should be paying attention to now.

As DrupalCon 2022 approaches, Amy June shares the lessons she thinks WordPress can learn from Drupal\u2019s relationship with its contributors and open source.\n\nWhy This Is Important: Drupal and WordPress are both mature open source PHP/MySQL CMS platforms that emerged in the early 2000s.

Find out how all of us in the WordPress community can support the performance team.\n\nWhy This is Important: Performance is an often-discussed topic when it comes to WordPress.

Matt Mullenweg has expressed interest in taking this path.\n\nWhy This Is Important: Gutenberg, according to Matt, is \"bigger than WordPress,\", especially in the context of the Open Web. The Block Protocol is a way to create and share content across WordPress, half-WordPress, and non-WordPress sites, which supports the project's mission to democratize publishing.\n\nEvery week Post Status Excerpt will brief you on important WordPress news \u2014 in about 15 minutes or less!

Last month on Twitter and Post Status Slack Lesley floated the idea of special contributor badges on WordPress.org. These badges would give developers who earned them a boost to their plugin and theme rankings. The goal would be to encourage new contributors to enter the WordPress ecosystem and recognize those in the community who are doing typically unpaid work that carries the project forward.\n\nWhy This Is Important: Improving the contributor onboarding experience will help WordPress gain more core contributors. Some ideas going around the WordPress community involve additional sponsorships, new sources of funding, and public recognition.

Skeptic may be too strong of a word, but she makes it clear that she thinks WordPress is too often used when it\u2019s not necessary.\n\nKira handles every part of her projects, which typically stem with marketing and copywriting, but she takes on design, development, and whatever is required to get the job done. She is the type of person who WordPress should be able to serve quite ably. But more than not, she would rather steer clear.\n\nIn this episode of the Draft Podcast, I talk to her about her work, why she is pained by WordPress, and try to come to some conclusions from it all. I am not sure if I accomplish much, but I do feel like I am better able to see where she\u2019s coming from.\n\nThis conversation stemmed from a friend linking me to a post Kira wrote that was (to my mind) a bit aggressive toward WordPress \u2014 and while perhaps not 100% accurate, it is 100% her perception of the reality that is working with\u202637 minplaylist_addAug 2, 2019WooCommerce vs Shopify: A battle for ecommerce platform dominanceBen Thompson recently wrote about Shopify and the Power of Platforms. He highlights the difference between an aggregator (e.g. Amazon\u2019s Merchant Services) and a platform (Shopify) and makes a case for how Shopify can successfully compete against Amazon. If you\u2019re new to Ben\u2019s work, I highly recommend following the links he references in the opening paragraphs. Aggregators vs Platforms\n\nAs Ben explains, Amazon is an aggregator that owns the users (i.e. customers, Amazon Prime subscribers) and aggregates the suppliers (i.e. merchants, manufacturers). Amazon succeeds by providing a great user experience (e.g. one click checkout, same day delivery) and by treating products and their suppliers as commodities, all available to the customer in a single, aggregated shopping experience. While aggregation can provide high value for customers, it minimizes the opportunity for merchants to differentiate and can ultimately hurt customers as competition and innovation are stifled.\n\nA competito\u202645 minplaylist_addJun 25, 2019Matt Mullenweg on eCommerce, and what's new with Post StatusI talked to Matt Mullenweg for over an hour recently, and here I share about 8 minutes of our conversation, a part where we discuss eCommerce, and where WooCommerce currently fits into that world.\n\nI also spend several minutes talking about big changes happening with Post Status.

We also discussed how that will affect other non-major updates and WordPress features.\n\nMatt also talked about the WordPress REST API, how he defines success for it, what he hopes to see out of it, and what he thinks would cause it to revert to a plugin only feature.\n\nAnd as this was the second and final year of WordCamp US in Philadelphia, we reflected on the event, and talked about what there is to look forward to in Nashville for WordCamp US 2017 and 2018.25 minplaylist_addNov 7, 2016Learning WordPress development and how employers should look at candidatesWelcome to the Post Status Draft podcast, which you can find on iTunes, Google Play, Stitcher, and via RSS for your favorite podcatcher.

So when John Parris -- at the time primarily working with Easy Digital Downloads -- said he was interested in helping make RCP a proper membership plugin, Pippin jumped on the opportunity.\n\nThey have had a good bit of success early on in the attempt to rejuvenate this product: Our goal was to double or triple the monthly revenue within six months.

Why did you make such a big bet on Calypso?\n Matt has talked for a while now about his vision that WordPress can become an \"app platform\", and this is an example of what that meant to him.\n\nHe also notes how he's always looking for things that will \"move the needle\" for greater WordPress adoption. We were both thinking about the same statistic: that roughly 96% of WordPress.com users (and probably a high number of WordPress.org users too) essentially abandon their websites after a short tenure. So anything that can increase that number, to say 8% or 15% of folks that stick with it long term, can make a huge difference.

A small to mid-size non-profit organization, StoryCorp's interviews are logged in the Library of Congress, and over the years they have created new and ingenious ways to enable story telling.\n\nThere are recording booths in a number of cities throughout the country where anyone can go and record and interview or story. The first was in Grand Central Station, though it's since shut down due to budget issues.

CGCookie has been around since 2008, and today is a network of five websites, has thousands of paying members, a team of six full time employees plus a number of contractors.\n\nCGCookie is built completely on WordPress and has a built in membership component. Some astute readers may recognize both the site and Jonathan's name; Jonathan is Pippin Williamson's identical twin brother, and Pippin has worked with Jonathan on CGCookie many times. So, in this interview, you're not listening to me talk to Pippin -- though it sounds like it -- but I'm talking to Jonathan Williamson.\n\nJonathan is as passionate about CG, modeling, 3D printing, and the software that surrounds these disciplines as Pippin is about WordPress and programming. It was a pleasure to talk to Jonathan about what it's like to run a membership site that runs on WordPress.\u20261 hr 17 minplaylist_addAug 8, 2014How has WordPress changed your life?Last week, I was in New York City for WordCamp and some client meetings.

He had 653 Twitter followers at the time. I know so, because that\u2019s how we were introduced \u2014 through an email from Twitter telling me he was now following me. At the time, he\u2019d not even started daily writing on his personal blog; he didn\u2019t start that until September of that year.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a time where I didn\u2019t know who Chris Lema was, or a time where I wasn\u2019t learning from him. Today, Chris is a significant voice in the WordPress world. He was just announced, deservedly so, in the first batch of speakers for WordCamp San Francisco.\n\nHe\u2019s been blogging nearly every day for two years. I\u2019ve met him at a number of events. We\u2019ve shared meals together. We\u2019ve had phone calls where Chris gave me advice for my career and life.

For years, Chris has been a consistent advocate for the platform. He develops his own websites with WordPress, but his day-to-day interactions are as a user.\n\nChris brings a unique perspective, I believe. He did some client work early in his career, but he\u2019s been more involved in SaaS projects and membership websites; his current membership websites are on WordPress (CSS-Tricks) and Ruby on Rails (CodePen).\n\nI asked Chris about his projects, his perspective on various aspects of WordPress, and the community around it.

That it\u2019s an eCommerce plugin \u2014 built on WordPress, well before such a thing seemed sensible \u2014 is even more of a testament to just how impressive this plugin is. It\u2019s been under development for eight years, and is nearing 3 million downloads on WordPress.org.\n\nToday, WP eCommerce is working to shed layers of duplicate functionality that can now be replaced by WordPress core. It\u2019s a wicked thing for a product to be ahead of its time. An eCommerce plugin built on WordPress is clearly \u2014 we know today \u2014 a viable thing. But for years, as WP eCommerce chugged along, many were skeptical that eCommerce and WordPress could \u2014 or even should \u2014 be harmonious.\n\nThat WP eCommerce is so old is its blessing and its curse.

He started by selling themes on ThemeForest. He transitioned to the Okay Themes brand in December of 2011. And at the end of March of this year, Mike transitioned yet again to Array.\n\nWhile these transitions may seem like arbitrary branding, to me they represent broader shifts both in Mike\u2019s style and the direction of the commercial WordPress space in general. He\u2019s never really attempted to fit anyone else\u2019s mold, but I believe he\u2019s done quite well at predicting the market and staying ahead of the pack; and that\u2019s why I love following his work.\n\nMike consistently challenges himself to succeed in a saturated space by attacking the market in a different way than the rest of the crowd.\n\nhttp://s3.amazonaws.com/PostStatus/DraftPodcast/mike-mcalister-post-status-draft.mp3\n\nDirect Download Selling WordPress themes on ThemeForest\n\nIn 2009, Mike discovered WordPress and saw the opportunities\u202653 minplaylist_addApr 17, 2014WordPress 3.9 roundtable with core contributorsI was privileged to be joined by six core contributors to WordPress 3.9 for a Google Hangout where we talked about the new release, contributing to WordPress, and more.\n\nTo learn more about WordPress 3.9, check out our summary.\n\nYou can watch the full video right here:\n\nI was joined by an all-star cast.

Few companies are both large (relatively speaking) and central to a broad WordPress community. With 60+ employees, some of which are very well-known WordPress developers, 10up has quickly become a central figure in the WordPress world. Big WordPress companies with significant community influence\n\nUntil recently, Automattic has always been the primary example cited as a mature company in the WordPress space. But it\u2019s hardly the only company using WordPress as a primary tool. Envato is similarly sized (just over 200 employees, and 50+ more this year), but Envato\u2019s business spans well beyond WordPress themes and plugins on ThemeForest and CodeCanyon.\n\nA 60+ person team doing web consulting is not particularly unique either.
