programming creating a local connection to the national and international dialogue about contemporary art and a framework for an interchange between artists, scholars, students and the community at large. While the exhibitions feature contemporary art, they often address other disciplines and societal issues in general. Integrated into the curriculum, these programs contribute significantly to Chapman education.\nArt in its many forms embodies a playing field of visibility, representation and writing of history. As part of the landscape of institutions that populates this field, we want to contribute to actively forming a vision of society and our campus community that is anti-racist and anti-oppression, where art is not produced and consumed as a luxury good, but as a means of convening and expressing a critical, ethical, and moral view of the world, and speaking truth to power.\u00a0\nWe acknowledge our responsibility to reflect the multiplicity and diversity of society and continue to commit to helping unwarp its distorted reflection in the art world. We are committed to continually educating ourselves and the community we serve, by exhibiting work that is contributing towards racial and gender equity and towards increasing diversity and inclusion. Through our exhibitions, events and virtual presence we pledge to raise the visibility and representation of Women and BIPOC Artists and their suppressed histories.\u00a0\nAbout the Gallery:\u00a0The Guggenheim Gallery was built in 1975 with a gift from Robert and Shirley Guggenheim. It sponsors an annual schedule of exhibitions by professional artists, students and community arts organizations. As part of the regular programming, it proudly hosts a variety of collaborations with area institutions including\u00a02017 Getty Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA initiative, 2013\u00a0California Pacific-Triennial Orange County Museum of Art,\u00a02011 Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945\u20131980,\u00a0Confronting Nature: Silenced Voices with Cal State Fullerton, Art and Architecture with ten So. California museums and galleries, and the 1994 Orange County Olympic Arts Festival.\nSolo exhibitions by internationally known California artists such as Manuel Ocampo and Tim Hawkinson alternate with multimedia and medium specific group exhibitions organized around themes which have included urbanism, the Mexico-US Border, feminism, death and dying, sex and humor, the Vietnam war, public art and religion. Chapman students install group exhibitions each semester and are required to show their work individually in their Junior & Senior years.\u00a0\nPlease note that the Guggenheim Gallery doesn't accept unsolicited exhibition proposals for review.\n\n\n\n\nThe Guggenheim Gallery at Chapman University stands in solidarity with protesters in the US and around the world against police brutality, oppression and systemic racism as we mourn the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and the countless other victims of police force. We join Wilkinson College\u2019s Department of Art in condemning all forms of racism, violence, bias, aggression and the marginalization of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) as well as discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion, intersectionality, ethnicity and socioeconomic status.\u00a0\nArt in its many forms embodies a playing field of visibility, representation and writing of history. As part of the landscape of institutions that populates this field, we want to contribute to actively forming a vision of society and our campus community that is anti-racist and anti-oppression, where art is not produced and consumed as a luxury good, but as a means of convening and expressing a critical, ethical, and moral view of the world, and speaking truth to power.\nWe acknowledge our responsibility to reflect the multiplicity and diversity of society and continue to commit to helping unwarp its distorted reflection in the art world. We are committed to continually educating ourselves and the community we serve by exhibiting work that is contributing towards racial and gender equity and towards increasing diversity and inclusion. Through our exhibitions, events and virtual presence we pledge to raise the visibility and representation of BIPOC artists and their suppressed histories. We echo the chants of protest in cities across the world and affirm that Black Lives Matter!\n\n\n\n\nExhibitions\n\n\nToggle Section\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                2020 -
