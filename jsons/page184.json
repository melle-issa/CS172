These hazards can affect not only the smoker but also the nonsmoker who is exposed to the smoke. Print and post the Smoke/Tobacco-Free Anti-Smoking flyer.\nAs a leader in healthcare and environmental practices, the University recognizes its responsibility to exercise leadership through the creation of a smoke-free environment for all students, employees and visitors at all University of California campuses, medical centers and facilities. Visit the UC Smoke & Tobacco Free Policy website for more information.\nThis policy is being adopted by all University of California campuses, labs and centers to improve the health and safety of all UC students, staff, faculty, patients and visitors. This policy prohibits the use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, snuff, snus, water pipes, pipes, hookahs, chew, and any other non-combustible tobacco product.\nAre Our Voices Being Heard?\nIn February 2019, the \"Clearing the Air\" Survey was announced to assess the impact of the smoke/tobacco-free policy on our campus. The responses from the survey provide valuable insight into the impact of the policy on the campus environment and help UCR identify opportunities that can be improved on. See the 2019 \"Clear the Air\" survey results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTobacco Free Information & Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy\n\n\n\n\nPolicy Enforcement\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of California, Riverside\n\n900 University Ave.\n            Riverside, CA 92521\nTel: (951) 827-1012\n\n\nUCR Library\nCampus Status\nCampus Store\nCareer Opportunities\nDiversity\nMaps and Directions\nVisit UCR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment Information\n\u00a0\n \n\nMailing Address: UCR Human Resources 900 University Avenue, Riverside, California 92521\nLocation Address: University Village 1201 University Avenue, Suite 208 Riverside, California 92521 Tel: (951) 827-5588 | Fax: (951) 827-2672\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links\nAcademic Personnel\nUCOP Human Resources\u00a0\nPlanning, Budget & Administration\nUCPath@UCR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and Accessibility\nTerms and Conditions\n\u00a9 2023 Regents of the University of California\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us help you with your search\n\n\nEnter your Search Criteria.\n\n\n\nSearch All UCR\n\n\nSearch This Site\n\n\nCancel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
