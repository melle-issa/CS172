However, due to the\u00a0Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), BOSP staff is prohibited from discussing individual student issues directly with parents and family.\u00a0 Please encourage your student to communicate directly with our staff regarding your questions or concerns. That said, we put together an overview of the study abroad process, included some helpful links, and a few resources such as\u00a0tips for parents and family\u00a0to give you a better idea how you can best support your student before, during, and after he or she studies abroad.\nExploring BOSP Programs\nBOSP offers your student many study abroad opportunities\u00a0including quarter length programs, overseas seminars, and internships. See our\u00a0Study Abroad Overview\u00a0to explore all of these opportunities. BOSP also provides\u00a0study abroad advising\u00a0for every BOSP program as well as other information such as\u00a0Courses,\u00a0Faculty-in-Residence,\u00a0\u00a0Language Prerequisite FAQs,\u00a0Internship Opportunities\u00a0and Important Program Dates that students should consider before choosing a program.\nAll BOSP programs offer direct Stanford credit for courses.\nMany BOSP courses fulfill General Education Requirements and frequently count toward one or more majors.\nStanford Faculty-in-Residence teach abroad in most BOSP quarter length program.\nMany BOSP programs offer internship and service learning opportunities!\nTake Action: Help your student consider all of the opportunities BOSP offers and research them; there might be a \u201cbest-fit\u201d program that he or she hadn\u2019t even considered before.\nFinancing Study Abroad\nStanford is committed to providing undergraduates the opportunity to study abroad with BOSP, regardless of financial circumstances. To view a breakdown of the cost comparisons of a quarter studying abroad vs. a quarter on campus, and other financial resources visit\u00a0Financing Study Abroad.\nRegular Stanford tuition applies.\nFinancial Aid continues and aid packages are automatically adjusted in accordance with differences in travel and personal expenses while abroad, taking into consideration a student\u2019s inability to work while out of the country.\nTake action: Have your student contact the\u00a0Financial Aid Office (FAO)\u00a0to find out what financial assistance may be available.\nApplication Process\nStudents need to submit an application two quarters in advance for all programs (except for the Overseas Summer Seminars, which have an application deadline during Autumn Quarter).\nBOSP strongly encourages students to spend more than one quarter abroad, if possible. Students can apply to and participate in multiple quarter-length programs abroad. They can extend their quarter abroad to two or three quarters depending upon the program and quarter without reapplying.\nAdditional internship/research/course opportunities may be available\nHigher level of language fluency and cultural understanding\nExplore and immerse in a different culture and achieving language literacy\nGaining substantive understanding of other perspectives in the world that deepen a student's awareness of him/herself, his/her educational goals, and his/her own society.\nTake Action: Help your student consider the benefits of studying abroad for two quarters.\nBOSP Preparing Students and Setting Expectations\nStanford University believes that students are ultimately responsible for preparing themselves to study abroad and for making the most of their time overseas. This responsibility encompasses but is not limited to:\nA wide range of mandatory participation requirements:\nComplete and pass the minimum language or academic prerequisite prior to the first day of the quarter in an overseas program or the arrival date for an Overseas Seminar, Other Programs (this does not include non-Stanford study abroad programs), and/or our Consortium Programs.\nBe in good academic standing prior to the first day of the start of the overseas program.\nSubmit all required materials by the deadline established by the Bing Overseas Studies Program.\nPolicies and Standards:\nUpholding Stanford University policies, rules and regulations, and meeting academic requirements.\nCompleting all the necessary steps to obtain a visa (if required) in a timely manner and responsible for associated costs and for complying with the terms of the visa.\nObtaining and maintaining health insurance coverage equal to or greater than that offered by the Stanford Cardinal Care plan.\u00a0 Said coverage shall, at a minimum, include coverage for medical care and treatment outside the United States and coverage for both medical evacuation and repatriation of remains.\nShould the policies and standards not be upheld by the student, the student MUST provide timely notice OR at the sole discretion of the Bing Overseas Studies Program after providing timely notice, \u00a0they may be (involuntarily) withdrawn from the program and subject to late withdrawal penalties. This is to ensure fairness to all students on the program and program waitlist.\nTake Action: Help support your student prepare for studying abroad by coming up with a communication plan together. See our\u00a0Tips for Parents and Family\u00a0page to get started.\nReturning to Stanford\nReturning to Stanford after studying abroad can be challenging for your student who might have trouble re-adjusting to campus life and re-assimilating into American culture. After studying abroad, your student might have different goals, academic or career plans. They might also want to consider taking advantage of other opportunities at Stanford or abroad and/or become an active part of BOSP's growing alumni network.\nThere are important steps your student will need to take before he or she returns to Stanford: enrollment in axess, housing and dining, university billing and financial aid. For more information, see our\u00a0Before You Return page.\nRe-entry shock and other difficulties re-adjusting to campus are challenges your student might face. Read about\u00a0Re-entry\u00a0and how a student might prepare him or herself to return and transition back to campus.\nReturning students often apply for scholarship and fellowships and take advantage of many\u00a0Future Opportunities\u00a0abroad, including research, working, studying, teaching, and volunteering.\nYour student can stay connected as an alum to his or her study abroad experience by reading about exciting program updates and changes in our\u00a0Abroad Alumni Newsletter.\nTake Action: You can play a very positive role in your student's transition back to campus by taking a personal interest in actively listening and learning about his or her abroad experience abroad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford\n\n \nBing Overseas\nStudies Program\n\n\n\nWeb Login\n\n\n\nAddress\n\nBing Overseas Studies Program\nSweet Hall, Ground Floor\n590 Escondido Mall\nStanford, CA 94305-3089\nUnited States\n\n\n\nVisit\n\n\nCampus Map\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOSP Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nBOSP Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\nBOSP Twitter\n\n\n\n\n\nBOSP Youtube\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\nAbout Us and Program Center Contacts\n\n\nStaff Listing for BOSP at Stanford\n\n\nStudent Ambassadors\n\n\nStanford Undergrad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to BOSP's mailing list to receive more information about programs, application deadlines, and events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford\n\n\n\nVPUE\n\nVice Provost for Undergraduate Education\n\n\n\n\nStanford Undergrad is your guide to undergraduate academics and opportunities found within the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education.\n\n\n\nSweet Hall\n590 Escondido Mall\nStanford, CA 94305\nmap\n\nConnect with us!\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed help?\nvpue@stanford.edu\n(650)723-4463\n\nMore to Explore\n\nAcademic Advising\nResearch and Independent Projects\nTutoring and Support\nFor Faculty / Staff\n\nVPUE Units\n\nAcademic Advising\nBing Overseas Studies Programs\nCenter for Teaching and Learning\nHaas Center for Public Service\nProgram in Writing and Rhetoric\nStanford Introductory Studies\nVice Provost\u2019s Office\n\n\n\nVPUE Programs\n\nApproaching Stanford (APSU)\nArts Intensive (AI)\nBing Honors College (BHC)\nBing Overseas Studies Programs (BOSP)\nCardinal Service\nCivic, Liberal, and Global Education (COLLEGE)\nEducation as Self-Fashioning (ESF)\nFrosh 101 / Transfer 101\nHume Center for Writing and Speaking\nIntroductory Seminars (IntroSems)\nITALIC: Immersion in the Arts\nLeland Scholars Program (LSP)\nNew Student Orientation (NSO)\nOral Communication Program\nProgram in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR)\nSophomore College (SoCo)\nStructured Liberal Education (SLE)\nStudent Learning Programs\nSummer Bridge Programs\nSummer Fellows Program (SSFP)\nResearch and Independent Projects\nWays of Thinking / Ways of Doing (WAYS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanfordUniversity\n\n\n\n\nStanford Home(link is external)\n\nMaps & Directions(link is external)\n\nSearch Stanford(link is external)\n\nEmergency Info(link is external)\n\n\n\nTerms of Use(link is external)\n\nPrivacy(link is external)\n\nCopyright(link is external)\n\nTrademarks(link is external)\n\nNon-Discrimination(link is external)\n\nAccessibility(link is external)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University.\n\u00a0 Stanford, California 94305.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Back to Top\n\n\n\n\n",
