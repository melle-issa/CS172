Samples tend to have some variability simply due to the nature of environmental samples, but the general trends over time have proven accurate and consistent with trends in clinical cases.\n\nThe two blue markers on this graph represent the two genes (N, light blue and S, medium blue) \u00a0that are present in every COVID variant, representing the total overall presence of COVID RNA in the sample. The orange markers track the prevalence of the variants Omicron BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5 (orange)\u00a0and the purple markers track Omicron BA.4 + BA.5 (purple). These are recently present variants.\nFurther information on how to read this plot is below.\n\nWastewater analysis is an increasingly important part of the university\u2019s ongoing strategy to monitor the level of community transmission. SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is shed in feces by infected individuals and can be measured in wastewater.\nThe university collects and analyzes samples from a large sewer main that drains wastewater from about 10,000 people studying, working and residing in the sewershed of Stanford\u2019s Codiga Resource Recovery Center. This sewershed includes more than 150 buildings on campus (see map below), including faculty, staff and student housing, and classroom, research and office buildings.\nSamples were collected six days a week prior to November 2022. Starting November 1, 2022, samples are collected twice a week (on Mondays and Wednesdays). Samples are analyzed within 24 hours of collection. Results are then uploaded to this dashboard.\n\n\nCollection and analysis at the Stanford site began in July 2021. This effort is part of SCAN (sewer coronavirus alert network), a regional epidemiology project based at Stanford and developed in collaboration with local public health officers and 11 wastewater treatment plants in the Greater Bay Area and Central California, and the California Department of Public Health. Maps and wastewater measurements in those locations are available from SCAN.\n\n\nClick image above to download map as PDF\n\n\nSARS-CoV-2 Sewage Monitoring Data\nSome information below is sourced from Santa Clara County Public Health.\nMore cases of COVID-19 in the community are associated with increased levels of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in wastewater, meaning that data from wastewater analysis can be used as an indicator of the level of transmission of COVID-19 in the community.\nWastewater analysis measures the levels of non-infectious RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) in wastewater, not the viable virus. There are no known cases of transmission resulting from exposure to wastewater.\nAdvantages of using wastewater to monitor COVID-19 infections\nThe use of wastewater to infer information about COVID-19 transmission has several potential advantages: \u00a0\nWastewater includes contributions from asymptomatic individuals and people who are unable or unwilling to obtain clinical tests, for a variety of reasons.It provides a mechanism to monitor the level of community transmission as clinical testing declines, and other, more convenient testing takes place (such as home-based rapid antigen tests) that are not reported to the public health departments. Wastewater information is available sooner than information from clinical testing, which means that monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater can serve as an early indicator of increasing or decreasing COVID-19 infections in the community.During an increase, this early information could be used to enhance public health messaging in our community to reinforce safe practices, promote more clinical testing, and highlight strategies our community can take to help stop a surge in new cases.It can help confirm current trends of COVID-19 infections in our community that are based on clinical data.It can increase confidence that clinical testing results are not biased by availability, time lags, and other factors.\nSARS-CoV-2 Measurements in Wastewater\nThe plot shown above provides an overview of the results of SARS-CoV-2 measurements in wastewater over time. These are the results for two SARS-CoV-2 genes that are present in every variant: N gene and S gene. In addition, results for genes present in Omicron BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 (LPPA24S) and Omicron BA.4\u00a0+ BA.5 (HV69-70) are shown. The concentrations for these genes are normalized by an internal standard (copies of RNA from the genome of pepper mild mottle virus, PMMoV).\nAlternate data formats\nStanford University is committed to providing an online environment that is accessible to everyone, including individuals with disabilities.
