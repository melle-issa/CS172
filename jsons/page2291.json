The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. theme without any code directly in the editor using the current tools. The aim is to both find gaps in functionality and to get feedback on the experience of using the Site Editor in this design centric way, as we look to expand the number of block themes.\u00a0\nThe focus of this exploration is to think with a more open minded, \u201cwhat can I build today?\u201d approach. If you\u2019ve never built a block theme, consider this an invitation to give it a try. Tooling has come a long way and the power of what\u2019s being built is that it allows more folks to dive into the future (and present) of WordPress. For this experience, you\u2019ll use the Create Block Theme pluginPlugin A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website. They can extend functionality or add new features to your WordPress websites. WordPress plugins are written in the PHP programming language and integrate seamlessly with WordPress. These can be free in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory https://wordpress.org/plugins/ or can be cost-based plugin from a third-party to facilitate the creation and export process so you can keep what you create! Feel free to read these brief instructions for how to get started or follow the steps below.\nIn the near future, expect a more formal call for testing once more, dedicated to some of the newer functionality being worked on as part of the remaining major phase 2 items.\u00a0\nExploration Instructions\nTo use a prebuilt test site:\u00a0\nOpen this link only once: https://app.instawp.io/launch?t=fse-block-theme-exploration&d=v1\u00a0 Please do not repeatedly open this link as it creates a new site each time.\nThis will launch a site for you to use for up to 5 days.\u00a0\nSave the link to your site so you can access it again during the test.\u00a0\nTo set up your own test site:\u00a0\nHave a test site using the latest version of WordPress. It\u2019s important this is not a production/live site.\u00a0\nInstall and activate the Create Block Theme plugin.\nInstall and activate GutenbergGutenberg The Gutenberg project is the new Editor Interface for WordPress. The editor improves the process and experience of creating new content, making writing rich content much simpler. It uses \u2018blocks\u2019 to add richness rather than shortcodes, custom HTML etc. https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/ 15.4 (or the latest version).\u00a0\nCreate the base of your theme\nNavigate to Appearance > Create Block Theme.\nChoose either \u201cCreate blank theme\u201d to start completely from scratch or you can use the currently active block theme by choosing the \u201cClone\u201d option.\u00a0Note: You are welcome to use a block theme of your choosing if you Clone!\nFill out the information for either option. Feel free to keep this pretty simple since this is just for testing and not official block theme launching purposes. When done, select \u201cGenerate\u201d.\nHead to Appearance > Themes and activate the theme you just created.\nConfigure your fonts\nHead to Appearance > Manage Theme Fonts.\nFrom here, you can add a Google font or a Local font if you have any you\u2019d like to use. This will install the fonts (download them) as part of the theme but these fonts still need to be applied.\u00a0\nOnce added, you can then manage the font weights.\u00a0\nAfter you\u2019re done, head to Appearance > Editor and open Styles to configure these fonts for use on your theme under Typography.\u00a0\nMake your changes and export\nHead to Appearance > Editor and begin customizing as you\u2019d like!\u00a0\nHere are some high level ideas:\u00a0\nUse the Styles interface to make global changes to the Layout, Typography, and more.\u00a0Use the Stylebook to see your changes at a glance to individual blocks.\u00a0\nUse the design tools built into each block to make individual changes.\u00a0\nCreate new templates or template parts.\u00a0\nAdd or remove different blocks from current templates or template parts. \nExport your theme\nWhen you\u2019re done making your changes, head to Appearance > Create Block Theme.\nFrom there, choose the \u201cExport\u201d option. This option will automatically include user changes so you don\u2019t have to overwrite them first.\nPlease share feedback by April 26th, 2023\nWhat to notice\nWhile you\u2019re welcome to share feedback on any aspect of the experience, here are a few specific questions to focus your feedback. \nDid the experience crash at any point?\nDid the saving experience work properly?\u00a0\nWhat did you find particularly confusing or frustrating about the experience?\nWhat did you especially enjoy or appreciate about the experience?\u00a0\nWhat did you need to use Custom CSSCSS CSS is an acronym for cascading style sheets.

What about using the Transform To menu to switch a Reusable blockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor.

Be it Header, Footer etc. Being able to easily transform from one type of Header pattern to another.\nYes! These two issues touch on exactly that:\nhttps://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/44581\n&\nhttps://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/44582\nAlso noting that you can use the \u201creplace\u201d option to do that for template parts! I\u2019ve added a comment to this issue open about moving that \u201creplace\u201d option to the transform menu:\nhttps://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/42425\nHow do I keep the Footer on the bottom of the page independent of how much content is on the page/post?\nCheck this out: https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/06/minimum-height-dimensions-block-support/\n\u201cThe feature allows users to set a Group or Post Content block to have a minimum height, similar to the control that exists for the Cover block. An example use case is to ensure that a post content area has a minimum height, forcing a footer area to render lower on the page, even if a page has little content. For this reason, it can be quite useful to use viewport relative units when setting minimum height, e.g. 100vh for a block that takes up the entire height of the viewport.\u201d\nThe Post Content block.\nIn the Page Template I changed the text inside the Page Content block and expected to see the text added to all the pages, but it was only added to the front page. There is obviously something I am missing here\u2026\nIn watching your video, I see you paused and then restarted recording after making some unknown changes there: https://youtu.be/tniEqn9q0fk?t=1556 I think what you did is somehow edit the post content block placeholder text.  I am not sure how you did that though \ud83d\ude00 This doesn\u2019t change the functionality of the block which is to display the post/page content. Can you clarify what you did there?\nI add a Header pattern and now I have one official Header template part where I see it has the Header template part label.\nThe other newly added Header pattern does not have the Header template label but is in a Row. How do I make the new pattern become the Header template part?\nAh when you added in a header pattern, it didn\u2019t automatically convert to a header template part block. Instead it remained as a pattern. This comes up as part of this problem:\nhttps://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/41397\nI\u2019ll add a note there with a link to your video where this happens! Great usability feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaal Joachim Romdahl\n\n8:17 pm on April 7, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nThank you Anne!\nI am going through your excellent feedback.\nA few additional comments.\nMinimum height is very helpful, but it will not keep the footer sticked/fixed to the bottom of the viewport in the browser.

Unfortunately though, they lack one important feature, which would take them from being great to absolutely amazing. This missing feature is the ability to sync and edit patterns globally, without altering the content within them.\nAs you noted, this is the best issue to follow on that front: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/48458 I\u2019ll mention this in the recap as well.\nIt\u2019s also a shame that we have to introduce another div to the markup to achieve this.\nSticky positioning was added to a template part block and later reverted.

I am glad it may help in the recap.\nIn response to intrinsic design, I am all for it but even then I believe responsive control will still be needed in certain situations. Every page builder and website building tool out there offers this feature, so I don\u2019t think WordPress can do without it just yet. One basic example is simply having control over how the columns collapse down from desktop > tablet > mobile. For example, you might want columns to collapse 4 > 2 > 1 or 4 > 2 > 2.

The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. themes building using Carolina Nymark\u2019s No-Code theme generator as a starting point, and then built upon it in the Site Editor. I appreciated the generator\u2019s simple setting options, which didn\u2019t overwhelm me with too many choices, as I am still learning the many elements of theme.jsonJSON JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a minimal, readable format for structuring data. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML.. The generated theme only consisted of an index template without any template parts, but its theme.json had automatically enabled useRootPaddingAwareAlignments, which allowed full-width sections/elements to be stretched outside of the group\u2019s constraint. During the building process, I used the overwrite function of Create Block Theme (CBT) to save all the changes to the theme.json file to make it the single source of truth for the final theme.\nSince I\u2019m not a designer but would love to have a proper spacing layout, good hierarchy of headings, and a harmonious color palette, I then copied some of those elements from a couple of themes. For spacing values (spacing.spacingSizes and styles.spacing.blockGap), I copied them from the Frost theme and adopted the predefined font size values of headings & paragraphs from the Beaumont theme. As for the color palette, I sought a monochromatic color scheme, which I generated from W3School\u2019s color schemes.\nI previously wrote custom CSSCSS CSS is an acronym for cascading style sheets. This is what controls the design or look and feel of a site. to set the site-title & post-title\u2019s text-decoration to none, but later found out that it can be done in theme.json. So my theme doesn\u2019t use custom CSS anymore.\nFor this theme, I created the following templates & template parts:\nTemplates:\n1. Home template\n2. Single template\n3. Page template\n4. No Title (custom template, need to be manually registered in theme.json)\n5. CategoryCategory The 'category' taxonomy lets you group posts / content together that share a common bond.

For us, this is the team that works on internal WordPress sites like WordCamp Central and Make WordPress. (applied to single template)\nFor font, I used Inter variable font Inter-VariableFont_slnt,wght.ttf which I uploaded using Create Block Theme pluginPlugin A plugin is a piece of software containing a group of functions that can be added to a WordPress website.

I summarized the process in the following steps.\n\nAdding Custom template named Home\nOverwrote the theme via CBT. Noticed that it created wp-custom-template-home template instead of home. I understand that this problem has been reported, and I have commented on the issue there https://github.com/WordPress/create-block-theme/issues/184#issuecomment-1442778292 \nRenamed wp-custom-template-home.htmlHTML HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language.

The Core Development Team builds WordPress.\u2019s pattern collections.\nOverwrote the theme via CBT\nObserve how the home.html now consists only a reference to home.php pattern in which the blocks code are now reside.\nUpon editing the home template, the image referenced in the pattern is gone. Attempting to recover the block effort is failed.\n\nThe aforementioned problem also happened if I added and overwrote a front-page template, but without the template renaming effort (it correctly named front-page.html), but there were some additional error messages showed up. Although the errors didn\u2019t fail the overwriting process.\n( ! ) Warning: rename() expects parameter 1 to be a valid path, object given in \u2026\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php on line 147\n( ! ) Warning: Cannot modify header information \u2013 headers already sent by (output started at \u2026\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php:147) in \u2026\\wp-admin\\includes\\misc.php on line 1431\n( ! ) Warning: Cannot modify header information \u2013 headers already sent by (output started at \u2026\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php:147) in \u2026\\wp-includes\\functions.php on line 6896\n( ! ) Warning: Cannot modify header information \u2013 headers already sent by (output started at \u2026\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php:147) in \u2026\\wp-admin\\admin-header.php on line 9\nInterestingly, I found the above problem does not happen if I added and overwrote single or page templates via CBT.\nBesides templates, I experimented with pattern creation. With the help of Pattern Manager plugin, I managed to copy one of the core\u2019s patterns named Quote and renamed it as quote-with-circle-image.php. The process went smoothly until I inserted the pattern at the home template and overwrote the theme using CBT. The following error messages appears after the overwriting process and the referenced image disappeared.\n( ! ) Warning: rename() expects parameter 1 to be a valid path, object given in \u2026\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php on line 147\n( ! ) Warning: rename() expects parameter 1 to be a valid path, object given in \u2026\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php on line 147\n( ! ) Warning: Cannot modify header information \u2013 headers already sent by (output started at \u2026\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php:147) in \u2026\\wp-admin\\includes\\misc.php on line 1431\n( ! ) Warning: Cannot modify header information \u2013 headers already sent by (output started at \u2026\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php:147) in \u2026\\wp-includes\\functions.php on line 6896\n( ! ) Warning: Cannot modify header information \u2013 headers already sent by (output started at \u2026\\wp-content\\plugins\\create-block-theme\\admin\\create-theme\\theme-media.php:147) in \u2026\\wp-admin\\admin-header.php on line 9\nAfter examining the troubled templates and patterns, I found that the image path was going to the theme\u2019s root assets/images folder. Copying the required images to the said folder solved the problem. Learning from this, I wondered if the image copying could be done during the CBT overwriting process and whether the overwriting process of templates that used core\u2019s patterns could output the result to the HTML template only instead of the HTML + PHPPHP PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. http://php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php. pattern to minimize confusion.\nFor the interested folks, I put the codes here, and the resulted live site here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeff Ong\n\n7:16 pm on April 20, 2023 \n\n\n\n\nThank you for the detailed notes, it\u2019s very helpful for debugging!\nRegarding your experience using CBT:\nSteps 1 \u2013 3 should be addressed by this recent addition to GutenbergGutenberg The Gutenberg project is the new Editor Interface for WordPress.

However, after exploring further, I find that there is different behavior when exporting via CBT or natively in the Site Editor.

It uses \u2018blocks\u2019 to add richness rather than shortcodes, custom HTML etc. https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/ and CBT plugin updated, so there were changes to some things while I worked. ( I like the link to Global Styles in the Appearance > Editor menu.)\n\nAdded 2 Google Fonts \u2013 Lora and Open Sans and used Global Style to add them to Text and Headings. This worked really well (as long as CBT plugin \u201cknows\u201d the theme.)\n\n2a. Added four additional colors to the basic WP color palette.\n\nEdited the Layout widths in GS, but this time I left the Block Spacing at the default 24px because I had issues previously. I\u2019ll try editing it again later, as I think I found what was not working for me, and it wasn\u2019t the actual Block Spacing.\n\nEdited the Buttons Block (I find it a bit odd to have some of the Button styles with the Global Typography and Colors, and then again down below in the Blocks, but I guess I don\u2019t have a suggestion, as many people would just want to change button colors and typography, and not padding or spacing , etc.)\n\n\nEdited the Quote Block to make the typography larger. (I also tried to add Custom CSSCSS CSS is an acronym for cascading style sheets. This is what controls the design or look and feel of a site. for the size of the \u201ccite\u201d but it didn\u2019t change, and it had in an earlier test, so I must have different selectors, and will track it down later.)\n\n\nAfter that I worked on editing the HeaderHeader The header of your site is typically the first thing people will experience.

It can influence a visitor\u2019s opinion about your content and you/ your organization\u2019s brand. It may also look different on different screen sizes. and  Footer.

Element to be\n\n\n<\nheader> and\n<\nfooter> respectively. I think that CBT plugin should already have them named with these HTML elements.\nFor the header, I uploaded a logo and removed the Site Title and TagTag Tag is one of the pre-defined taxonomies in WordPress. Users can add tags to their WordPress posts along with categories. However, while a category may cover a broad range of topics, tags are smaller in scope and focused to specific topics. Think of them as keywords used for topics discussed in a particular post. line and edited the menu in the header and not over in the Navigation, although they both changed. I added a bottom border and made the max width of the inner Row to be my wide width.\nI did similar to the footer for the width. I added a Row with the copyright and the Login/Out, reduced the top spacer size and added a top border.\nI did not try to create a new Header/Footer at this time.\n\nChanges to index.html were to put the Query LoopLoop The Loop is PHP code used by WordPress to display posts. Using The Loop, WordPress processes each post to be displayed on the current page, and formats it according to how it matches specified criteria within The Loop tags. Any HTML or PHP code in the Loop will be processed on each post. https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop. in a Group Block with the HTML Element  and add top and bottom padding.\n\nCreated a new Page Template using the Index to start. Removed the Query Block and added a Post Title and Post Content to the Group Block with  from step 7.\n\n\nNext I added a Custom Template \u2013 Page with No Title based on the Page Template and removed the Post Title.\nI created a \u201cFront Page\u201d  in Pages > Add New and used this Template for it. I\u2019ve used a Front Page Template in the past, and that\u2019s what I would normally do, but tried something different.\n\n\nNext was the \u201cSingle Item: Post\u201d template baed on Index again. I added Post Title, Post Content, Featured ImageFeatured image A featured image is the main image used on your blog archive page and is pulled when the post or page is shared on social media. The image can be used to display in widget areas on your site or in a summary list of posts. and copied the Row Block from the  Query Loop with the Post Author, Date, Cats, and Tags (just to save time). And deleted the Query Loop.  I added a Comments Block. No issues with that.\n\n\nThen I exported the theme using CBT plugin.\nAll of that went well.\n\n\nI duplicated the site, activated the Twenty Twenty-Two theme, and deleted the original theme that I had from CBT plugin that came along with the cloned site.\n\n\nI imported the theme I created with the CBT plugin and activated on the second site. And it all went really well, and looked exactly the same.\n\n\n I also made a small edit to the Page Template with no issues.\nAnd created a new header template part to use only with the Page template. I used one of the available header patterns.

Here goes:\nI created a new site via instawp, created a new empty blockBlock Block is the abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage using the WordPress editor. The idea combines concepts of what in the past may have achieved with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience. theme. That worked great.\nI uploaded one font (it was a google font which I had downloaded previously). The font-weights were correctly recognized.\nWhen I saved and returned to the previous screen a \u201cSystem font\u201d was added as well. How would I go about specifying a fallback font? Eg I normally use \u201cHelvetica, Arial, sans-serif\u201d as fallbacks for font-family \u2013 I guess this is only possible via custom CSSCSS CSS is an acronym for cascading style sheets. This is what controls the design or look and feel of a site.?\nFor the first time ever I opened the theme editor. I expected to see the right sidebarSidebar A sidebar in WordPress is referred to a widget-ready area used by WordPress themes to display information that is not a part of the main content. It is not always a vertical column on the side. It can be a horizontal rectangle below or above the content area, footer, header, or any where in the theme. (InspectorControls) open instantly, but I first had to click in the site to open it. I opened global styles and started to style my site. I could select the uploaded fonts in typography settings (see above about fallback fonts).\nStyling buttons (the block and elements) is split into \u201ctypography\u201d and \u201ccolors\u201d. This hierarchy may make sense and it\u2019s a way how many plugins in the past implemented in the customizerCustomizer Tool built into WordPress core that hooks into most modern themes. You can use it to preview and modify many of your site\u2019s appearance settings.. Still another way may be \u201cI want to style buttons, now show me all controls to style buttons\u201d. At the moment one has to go into typography for text and then into color for colors.\nTop level color styles: I\u2019m assuming this is styles \u201celements\u201d and the text above (\u201cdifferent global elements on the site\u201d) confirms that. I can\u2019t define hover/focus styles for buttons \u2013 which I would have to do via CSS.\nTop level typography styles: The icons for the different entries sometimes communicate current state (eg the background color on the button item), but other settings (eg removing text-decoration underline from link) does not change that. So the list is kind of mixed of current styles and base-styles. The text Aa icon seems to have a different font (the one i defined?) than heading and captions (allthough heading / captions do inherit that font).\nWhen I open the styles for specific blocks and style the button block, the slider for its border radius is set to 0 allthough it has a border-radius (coming from coreCore Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress. styles I guess). I have to move the slider up and down to get it to become 0.\nIn the storybook the text blocks do not contain any links.

This hierarchy may make sense and it\u2019s a way how many plugins in the past implemented in the customizerCustomizer Tool built into WordPress core that hooks into most modern themes. You can use it to preview and modify many of your site\u2019s appearance settings.. Still another way may be \u201cI want to style buttons, now show me all controls to style buttons\u201d. At the moment one has to go into typography for text and then into color for colors.\nEdited to add your feedback to a current issue on exactly this topic around the information architecture. Thanks so much:\nhttps://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/47369#issuecomment-1518729328\nTop level color styles: I\u2019m assuming this is styles \u201celements\u201d and the text above (\u201cdifferent global elements on the site\u201d) confirms that. I can\u2019t define hover/focus styles for buttons \u2013 which I would have to do via CSS.\nThat\u2019s correct right now! There\u2019s an effort to bring this into the Site Editor here: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/38277\nTop level typography styles: The icons for the different entries sometimes communicate current state (eg the background color on the button item), but other settings (eg removing text-decoration underline from link) does not change that. So the list is kind of mixed of current styles and base-styles. The text Aa icon seems to have a different font (the one i defined?) than heading and captions (allthough heading / captions do inherit that font).\nI\u2019ll include this in the usability feedback of the recap post. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll end up having it be a perfect 1:1 reflection but I think it\u2019s worth mentioning. Right now, the main way we do this for individual blocks at least is through this preview mechanism or the style book: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/42919\nWhen I open the styles for specific blocks and style the button block, the slider for its border radius is set to 0 although it has a border-radius (coming from coreCore Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress. styles I guess). I have to move the slider up and down to get it to become 0.\nExcellent feedback. This relates to the broader experience here: https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/43082 I\u2019ll note it in the recap!\nIn the storybook the text blocks do not contain any links. So to check the link styles I had to go to Design > Custom Link (the navigation block). It would be great to include a dummy lin in the paragraph block example data.\nGreat feedback!
