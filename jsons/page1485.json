It is the foundation upon which each and every major is built. The goal of the campus is to provide a well-rounded citizen, not only of the region and the nation, but of the world as well. Thus, this broad-ranging curriculum has been carefully designed to ensure that every graduate is exposed to current thinking and scholarship that will provide a lifetime of appreciation of the liberal arts and sciences, as well as the ability to grow intellectually, ethically, morally and technologically.\nAll students who graduate from Cal State Fullerton must complete 48-49 semester units of general education courses selected in accordance with the pattern designated on the following pages. General education courses must be selected from an approved list. Students should refer to their individual Titan Degree Audit to see a list of approved courses in each GE category. A student who has a break in enrollment for more than one semester in any calendar year may be held to new catalog requirements.\nCSUF students may complete lower-division general education requirements at a community college. In choosing equivalent courses, students must follow the CSUF general education\u00a0plan and not the plan of the community college. Questions can be directed to the CSUF Academic Advising Center, Gordon Hall 123B.\nDuring the first academic year, unless the requirement has been completed, students shall enroll in G.E. Area A.1, Oral Communication, G.E. Area A.2, Written Communication, and G.E. Area B.4, Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning\u00a0courses appropriate to their major and skill level.\nTitan Degree Audit\nThe Titan Degree Audit\u00a0serves as the official advising tool for both students and academic advisers. The report provides information on student progress toward\u00a0the completion of general education, major and other degree requirements, and will follow the student\u2019s progress from admission to graduation. Visit fullerton.edu/aac for instructions on accessing the TDA and the Titan Advising Network.\nGeneral Education Requirements\nUnit Requirements\n48-49 total units including:\n\nNine units upper division (300-level or 400-level courses)\u00a0in designated areas B.5, C.3 and D.3\u00a0should\u00a0be taken as a junior or senior at a CSU campus\nThree units in cultural diversity (courses marked with an asterisk *)\nEach course counts in only one G.E. Area, except those meeting Overlay Z, Cultural Diversity\u00a0or those in Area B that may combine the lab (B.3) within the B.1 or B.2 course\n\nAcademic Standards\n\nLetter grade required\nC-\u00a0(1.7) or better required in G.E. Areas A.1, A.2, A.3 and B.4. Thus, a grade of D+ (1.3) is not sufficient to fulfill these requirements\nCR/NC is\u00a0allowed if it is the only grade option available\n\nCourses in Your Major\n\nG.E. approved courses offered by the department of the student\u2019s major may be used to fulfill both\u00a0G.E. and degree\u00a0unit requirements.\nUpper-division G.E. courses are not applicable for graduate degree credit.\n\nTransfer Students\nThere are two General Education-Breadth patterns that California community college students can complete.\n\nCSU General Education-Breadth Program\n\tThis program is a lower-division, 39-semester-unit pattern. Students must take specified courses in five specific areas. Students with full certification are required to complete nine semester units of upper-division general education consisting of a minimum of three semester units each in Area B, C\u00a0and D within the CSU after transferring to CSUF.\n\t\u00a0\nIntersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum\n\tAll lower-division Cal State Fullerton G.E. requirements may be satisfied by the completion in its entirety of this transfer curriculum at a California community college. Information about IGETC is available at each campus. Upper-division G.E. requirements for IGETC-certified transfers are nine semester units of upper-division general education consisting of a minimum of three semester units each in Area B, C\u00a0and D within the CSU after transferring to CSUF.\n\nFor either pattern, a minimum of three units of a \u201ccultural diversity\u201d (identified with an asterisk *) course, if not met prior to transfer, is required. In addition, the U.S. History, Constitution\u00a0and American Ideals areas are required for graduation and must be completed if not met prior to transfer. Using their student portal, students can access their Titan Degree Audit to get a summary of their G.E. requirements.\nCSUF General Education Plans\nThe following G.E. plan is for students that have rights to the fall 2022-spring 2023 catalog years:\n\n\n\n\nArea A: Core Competencies\nOral Communication\nWritten Communication\nCritical Thinking\n\n\n9 units\nA.1\nA.2\nA.3\n\n\n\n\nArea B: Scientific Inquiry and Quantitative Reasoning\nPhysical Science\nLife Science\nLaboratory Experience\nMathematics/Quantitative Reasoning\nImplications and Explorations in the Natural Sciences and Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning\n\n\n12-13 units\nB.1\nB.2\nB.3\nB.4\nB.5\n\n\n\n\nArea C: Arts and Humanities\nIntroduction to the Arts\nIntroduction to the Humanities\nExplorations in the Arts or Humanities\n\n\n12 units*\nC.1\nC.2\nC.3\n\n\n\n\nArea D: Social Sciences\nIntroduction to the Social Sciences\nAmerican History, Institutions and Values\nExplorations in Social Sciences\n\n\n9 units\nD.1\nD.2\nD.3\n\n\n\n\nArea E: Lifelong Learning and Self Development\nLifelong Learning and Self-Development\n\n\n3 units\nE\n\n\n\n\nArea F: Ethnic Studies\nEthnic Studies\n\n\n3 units\nF\n\n\n\n\nOverlay Z: Cultural Diversity\nCultural Diversity (Courses are marked with an *)\n\n\nZ*\n\n\n\n\nMinimum Total\n\n\n48-49 units\n\n\n\n\n* 3 units from C.1; 3 units from C.2; 3 units from C.3; and 3 units from either C.1 or C.2. Designated high-unit majors may waive the \u201c3 units from either C.1 or C.2\u201d requirement. See an adviser for more information.\n\n\t\t\tStudents under earlier catalog years that contain different G.E. plans or who need help with the above chart should contact the Academic AdvisingCenter, Gordon Hall 123B, at\u00a0657-278-3606.\n\n\n\n\nCertification Policy\nUnder provisions of Title 5 and Executive Order 1100, accredited colleges and universities may certify the completion of part of the 48-49 units required in general education. Within the policy of the Board of Trustees, Cal State Fullerton will accept such certification of general education up to a maximum of 39 semester units, but may accept no more in general education than the number of units required in each area.\nTransfer students who are certified in any area with fewer than the required units will be subject to additional units and will be permitted to take the additional units in upper-division areas.\nAssociate Degrees for Transfer (AA-T/AS-T)\nThe Student Transfer Achievement Reform Act (SB 1440) establishes a transfer Associate of Arts (AA-T) or Associate of Science (AS-T) degree for California Community College students and is designed to provide a clear pathway to the CSU degree major. It allows students to complete an associate\u2019s degree while satisfying lower-division general education and major requirements for transfer at the same time.\nIt is important that students contact their local community college for information on meeting the requirements for a transfer AA-T or AS-T degree. Students who have completed an approved associate transfer degree program deemed \u201csimilar\u201d\u00a0to their Cal State Fullerton major are eligible to graduate in 60 units. The exact pathway to complete the specific major will depend on the specific AA/AS curriculum. The 60-unit graduation option will obviously not be possible if the student changes majors or elects to add any additional degree objective, such as a second major or minor. It is highly recommended students have a consultation with their department academic adviser or visit the Academic Advising office.\nFor more information, visit\u00a0admissions.fullerton.edu/prospectivestudent/transferdegree.php.\nLower-Division Transfer Patterns by Major\nLower-Division Transfer Patterns present potential transfer students with a set of \u201croad maps\u201d to follow that will ensure appropriate academic preparation for studies at CSU and decrease time to graduation once these students enter the CSU. The LDTP for each discipline or major has statewide as well as campus-specific components. The statewide component of the LDTP is appropriate for any CSU campus that offers the major and comprises general education coursework as well as some courses within the discipline. The campus-specific component identifies discipline-related coursework relevant to the major at the specific CSU campus where the student intends to transfer. Together these components for an LDTP will typically total at least 60 units, which is the number of units needed to transfer to CSUF as an upper-division student.\nThe Objectives of General Education\nGeneral education is central to a university education\u00a0and should enhance students\u2019 awareness of themselves in a complex universe, drawing upon multiple points of view. As a result of the general education experience, students should acquire knowledge of diverse disciplinary and cultural perspectives and skill in comparing, contrasting, applying and communicating effectively these perspectives in tasks considered appropriate to particular courses.\nThe General Education program at Cal State Fullerton is divided into six\u00a0major areas: A. Core Competencies, B. Scientific Inquiry and Quantitative Reasoning, C. Arts and Humanities, D. Social Sciences, E. Lifelong Learning and Self-Development and F. Ethnic Studies. Additionally, the General Education program includes one Overlay, Z. Cultural Diversity, that adds content but no additional units to designated general education courses.\nWritten communication, oral communication, critical thinking and mathematics/quantitative reasoning are essential components of the entire program of general education at Cal State Fullerton.\nGeneral education courses shall include student writing appropriate to the course. Writing in general education courses shall involve the organization and expression of complex data or ideas. Instructors shall provide careful and timely evaluations of writing so that deficiencies are identified and suggestions are offered for improvement on subsequent writing in the course. Evaluations of the student\u2019s writing competence shall be used in determining the final course grade. When a student is enrolled in a combined lecture and laboratory course, the laboratory portion of the course may be used to satisfy the general education writing requirement.\nNo single course should necessarily be expected to pursue every objective specified for that course\u2019s G.E. area or subarea, although each course should meet the preponderance of the learning objectives within that area or subarea, thus satisfying the spirit and intention of the learning objectives (i.e., the more objectives that a particular course addresses the more appropriate that course will be as a general education offering.) However, courses that satisfy Overlay Z, Cultural Diversity, must include all of the learning objectives.\nCourse syllabi for courses that meet general education requirements shall include the following:\n\nA statement of the specific general education requirement(s) that the course meets.\nA list of the learning objectives for the general education area or subarea in which the course carries credit.\nCourses in Oral Communication (A.1), Written Communication (A.2), Critical Thinking (A.3) and Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning (B.4) shall include a statement that \u201cA grade of C- (1.7) or better is required to meet this general education requirement. A grade of D+ (1.3) or below will not satisfy this general education requirement.\u201d\nA statement of how the general education writing requirement shall be met and assessed.\n\nGeneral education courses may be taught in any modality (e.g., face-to-face, hybrid or completely online).\n\nA. Core Competencies\nThe core competencies include Oral Communication, Written Communication\u00a0and Critical Thinking.\u00a0These shall be lower-division courses.\n\nOverall Objectives\nStudents taking courses in Area A shall practice and enhance their skills and abilities to:\n\norganize one\u2019s thoughts and communicate them clearly and effectively, using language that demonstrates sensitivity to gender and cultural differences.\nfind, evaluate, select, synthesize, organize, cite and present information and arguments clearly and effectively for a variety of purposes and audiences.\nrecognize and evaluate the features, functions, and contexts of language that express and influence meaning.\ncompare and contrast with care and accuracy the relative merits of alternative or opposing arguments, interpretations, assumptions\u00a0and cultural values.\nreflect in an open-minded manner on one\u2019s own thinking in relation to the ideas of others.\n\nA.1\u00a0Oral Communication\nCourses in subarea A.1\u00a0must be taught in English.
