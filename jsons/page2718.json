Complete the Summer Housing License Agreement and select the session you prefer to participate in.\u00a0Applications will be open until noon on April 29, 2023.\u00a0You will receive your Summer Housing room assignment by May 12, 2023.\u00a0\nPolicies and Regulations\nAll Housing Policies and Regulations are in effect for the summer. We encourage all students to review this material before submitting your housing license agreement.\u00a0 In signing and submitting a Summer Housing License Agreement, you agree to abide by these policies and regulations.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    FAQs  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    What if the set move-in and move-out dates don't work for me?  \n\n\nThe REACH Office worked out the dates for the best possible schedule that is compatible with the summer school schedule. The dates are not negotiable. You may sign up for a later date and leave early, but you will not be refunded the difference of days.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Can I live on campus if I am not taking a summer class?  \n\n\nTo live on campus for the summer, you need to meet one of the following criteria:\nTaking summer classes (online or in-person, for any session, with any number of credits).\nWorking or have an internship on campus.\nBe\u00a0enrolled as a Sonoma State student for the Fall 2023 term.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    What if I need to extend my Summer Housing License Agreement?  \n\n\nAt this point we anticipate minimal lease extensions. Please contact our office as soon as you believe you may need to request an extension.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    What is the deadline for canceling a Summer License Agreement?  \n\n\nWe understand that plans can change and you may no longer need to live on campus during the summer months. Please email us at housing@sonoma.edu 30 days prior to your move-in date. Cancellations received after April 30 or less than 30 days from the scheduled move-in date will be charged $250 for not providing a 30 day notice. Students who move in and then cancel will have their summer rent fees prorated.\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    How do you pay for Summer Housing?  \n\n\nBy submitting a signed Summer Housing License Agreement, you agree to have the total amount due posted to your student account. Charges will be posted to your account once eligibility and availability have been verified. At that time, payments can be submitted online.\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    What if I am unable to pay the full amount prior to move in?  \n\n\nWhen filling out your Summer Housing License Agreement, opt 'yes' to receive information about our available payment plans.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    When is your Summer Room Assignment confirmed?  \n\n\nSummer Room Assignments are made following the April 30 deadline and once contracting is complete.\u00a0 We cannot assign rooms prior to this.\u00a0 Expect this information to be sent via email no sooner than May 12.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    What is the room layout?   \n\n\nAll apartments have four single bedrooms with private bath.\nBeaujolais Village Map\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Can I choose my roommates?  \n\n\nRoom assignments are made based upon similar term dates. If you sign up for May 20 to August 14 and your requested roommate has signed up for June 23\u00a0to July 24, you probably will not be assigned to the same apartment.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    What if I want to change rooms/apartments?  \n\n\nDue to the short length of the summer and the limited number of summer residents, changes are not easily accommodated. Unauthorized changes shall result in additional charges for the room that has been moved into as well as the potential inability to contract with REACH to live on campus in the future.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Can I live in my Spring 2023 or Fall 2023 room during the Summer?  \n\n\nAll Summer Housing residents will be placed in the Alsace building in Beaujolais Village. Even if you are currently living in this building, you will be moving so that the maintenance and cleaning crews can refurbish your accommodation.\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    How does moving from my Spring room to my Summer room work?  \n\n\nIf you sign up to stay starting on May 20 and are currently living on campus, you will be staying in your current room until your summer assignment is ready. We anticipate this occurring on or around 3:00 p.m. on May 26.\u00a0 This week is used to clean and refurbish apartments prior to occupancy.\u00a0 Please make plans accordingly because you will need to be present to move and be vacated from your Spring room by 11:00 a.m. on May 29 so that we can prepare your room for summer use.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    How does moving from my Summer to Fall room work?  \n\n\nIf you sign up to stay through to Fall, you will move from your Summer room to your Fall room. Typically, this would occur the last week of July or the first week of August. When your Fall room becomes available, you will have 48 hours to move out of your Summer room to your Fall room. As such, you are expected to be on campus during that time frame to facilitate this move. The potential exceptions to this would be those individuals who would be moving into rooms currently being occupied by other Summer Housing students, thus delaying the move so that the apartment can be cleaned prior to your moving in.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Where do I pick up any mail or packages?   \n\n\nSummer Housing students may pick up their mail or packages at Campus Prints in the Student Center on the 2nd floor. Campus Prints is open Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., barring holidays.\u00a0\nStudents should address their mail as:\u00a0\nFirst and Last Name (as it was provided - no nicknames)\n1701 E. Cotati Avenue\nATTN: Summer Resident\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    How can I contact the REACH Office / How will they be contacting me?  \n\n\nThe REACH Office will use email as the primary source of contact regarding Summer Housing. You will also receive all information about your Summer Housing through email. The REACH email address is:\u00a0 housing@sonoma.edu.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidential Education and Campus Housing\n\nREACH  Home\nApply for HousingIncoming Student - Application\nReturning & Current Students - Application\nApply for Spring 2023\nSummer 2023 Housing\nAvailability Philosophy\nDisability Related Accommodation\n\nHousing Options\nOn Campus Rates & Installments\nHousing Portal\nMove In & Move Out\nResident Services & Resources\nFire Safety Report\nEmployee Housing\nLiving Off-Campus\nParent/Guardian\nWhy Live at SSU?\nAbout REACH\nContact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFacebook for REACH \n\n\nInstagram for REACH\n\n\nYouTube for REACH\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSU Facebook\nSSU Twitter\nSSU Instagram\nSSU Youtube\nSSU News RSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Ave\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n707.664.2880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact SSU\nPrivacy Notice\nCalifornia State University\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSafeSSU\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\nEmergency Information\nJobs\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
