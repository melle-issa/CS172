More than 3,500 people attended this year's Assistive Technology Conference at the Anaheim Marriott from March 13-17, 2023, that saw a \"significant increase\" in first-time attendees.

Murphy spoke about his idea for the conference back in 1984. \"I had a vision... if it was to be successful, of potentially helping thousands, upon thousands, upon thousands of people with disabilities, their families and those who serve them.\"  \n\n\n\nTime for some fun! Conference-goers could take a break in the evenings at different events that included karaoke, bingo and the traditional happy hour where folks could chat and mingle.

Clarke spoke about the powerful feeling of community. \"Just coming together and realizing that we're here for the same reasons, with the same goal and to be together in the same room.\" Photo by Lee Choo.\n\n\n\nCarlos Mitchell says he's checked out the exhibit hall \"5 or 6 times\" over the years. \"I like to see what the technology is out there, whether it's for myself or for other types of disabilities,\" he said.

Goren said the new technology is just part of the conference's appeal. \"Then, meeting people, of course. Meeting and networking and getting to know all these amazing people that are out here doing the same thing I want to do, to try and improve everybody's lives.\"  Photo by Lee Choo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you were a first-timer at the CSUN Assistive Technology Conference this year, you certainly weren\u2019t alone. This year saw a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in first-time attendees at the nation\u2019s\u00a0premier\u00a0tech conference for people with disabilities, that took place March 13-17 at the Anaheim Marriott.\nSo what drew all these new people in? Event and Marketing Manager for CSUN\u2019s Center on Disabilities, Andrew Elkins, said the jump was likely due, in part, to a more robust digital advertising campaign.\n\u201cI believe that the reputation of the conference and positive word-of-mouth from the community drew new attendees as COVID travel restrictions were reduced,\u201d Elkins said. \u201cThat, and the need to connect with the community after isolation.\u201d\nThat sense of community was on display at what many attendees call the \u201cCSUN conference.\u201d People lingered in conference rooms to talk after the educational sessions\u2013 of which more than 300 were offered. Many sat or stood out in the hallways to catch up with others, while red-shirted staff members roamed the large hotel conference center, ready to help anyone who needed assistance finding their way. There was even a new conference feature this year, called \u201cBirds of a Feather\u201d \u2014 these popular hosted get-togethers took place at lunchtime each day for people with similar interests\u2013 one was devoted to first-time attendees.\nAnother big draw at the conference was the exhibit hall, which was free to the public. Two enormous rooms housed more than 100 exhibitors, ranging from technology giants like IBM and Sony to small companies showcasing their accessibility-minded products. There were numerous types of technology and services on display, including a variety of screen readers, apps and cameras.\nMore than 3,500 people attended this year\u2019s annual conference and technology expo, which got its start in 1985 on the CSUN campus. It\u2019s one of a handful of conferences in the world dedicated to showcasing new technology to create more inclusive experiences for people with disabilities. CSUN Today talked with some of the people who attended to find out their favorite aspects of the event.\nMika Pyyhkala is the director of digital accessibility for Envision, a Kansas-based company that offers products and services to blind and visually impaired people. He has been coming to the conference for many years, following it through many changes of venue.\n\u201cBack when it was at LAX, and when it was at San Diego and when it came here,\u201d\u00a0Pyyhkala said.\nFor him, the major reasons for attending are to check out the latest technology and to network. \u201cThe blind community is small and you know there are some people that you might just see at one or two events throughout the year, from different parts of the country.\u201d\nPyyhkala\u2019s colleague, Therese Goren, came to the conference for the first time last year.\n\u201cI have heard about the famous CSUN Conference for years and have always wanted to come,\u201d Goren said.\nGoren teaches and trains people on how to use screen readers, magnification devices and other assistive technology as a senior analyst at Envision. The \u201clatest and greatest\u201d tech on display piqued her interest.\n\u201cAnything to do with digital accessibility,\u201d she said. \u201cThen meeting and networking and getting to know all these amazing people that are out here doing the same thing that I want to do and try and improve everybody\u2019s lives.\u201d\nKeith Clark was overseeing the T-Mobile booth in one of the conference\u2019s exhibit halls, explaining the products and services available for the hard of hearing, deaf, blind and people with speech disabilities. Through his interpreter, Jay Slater Scancella, Clark said this was his second time working at the conference.\n\u201cI\u2019ve already met so many folks that I remember from last year, people [saying] \u2018Oh, I remember you\u2019 and it\u2019s just great to reconnect,\u201d Clark said. \u201cBetween last year and this year, so many things have happened. So many new technologies have emerged. It\u2019s a very, very quickly growing field.\u201d\nNext year\u2019s conference will take place March 18-22, 2024 at the Anaheim Marriott.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Alumni, Community, CSUN, CSUN Assistive Technology Conference, Events, Students\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n\n\n\nCSUN Success Story: How Malachia Hoover\u2019s Time as a Matador Put Her on the Path to Saving Lives\n\n\nStudying Away \u2013 Get to Know the International and Exchange Student Center\n\n\nCSUN to host multimedia performance that explores climate change\n\n\n\u2018Ghosts\u2019 Stories: On a Hit TV Show, CSUN Alum Uses His Voice\n\n\nTribal Leader, Philanthropist and Acclaimed Author to Receive Honorary Doctorates from CSUN\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u2190 CSUN to host multimedia performance that explores climate change\nStudying Away \u2013 Get to Know the International and Exchange Student Center \u2192\n\n\n\n\n Top Stories\n\n\n\nFeatured Tag\n\n\n\n\n\n \u2018Ghosts\u2019 Stories: On a Hit TV Show, CSUN Alum Uses His Voice\non April 26, 2023in Alumni, Arts and Culture\n\n\n Tribal Leader, Philanthropist and Acclaimed Author to Receive Honorary Doctorates from CSUN\non April 25, 2023in Alumni, Community, CSU News, CSUN Events, Education, Faculty and Staff News, Graduation Ceremony, Honors & Awards, Media Releases, University News\n\n\n CSUN Breaks Ground on Autodesk Technology Engagement Center, a Project with National Impact\non April 24, 2023in Donor Profile, Giving\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCSU Resources CSU Leader\nCSYouCSU News\n\nTopicsArts and Culture\nAthletics\nBusiness\nCommunity\nCSU News\nEducation\nFaculty and Staff News\nHealth and Fitness\nMedia Releases\nPolitics and Society\nScience and Technology\n CSUN in the News\n\nCalifornia State University Northridge President Dr. Erika D.
