Some programs recommend the\u00a0Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum\u00a0(IGETC),\u00a0\u00a0which is a series of courses that California Community College students can complete to satisfy first- and second-year general education requirements before transferring. Some programs want you to focus on prerequisites instead of IGETC. Use\u00a0ASSIST.org\u00a0to see what your major program recommends or contact a\u00a0UCR admissions counselor\u00a0for help.\u00a0View the Assist Brochure\u00a0for more information.\nEach major has a minimum GPA requirement. Some majors require a GPA higher than that required for basic admission. Programs are selective. Strive to surpass your program\u2019s minimum GPA. Remember: All transferable coursework will be taken into account.\n\n\n\n\n            Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering Requirements    \n\nBreadth Requirements\nYou are strongly encouraged to focus on preparatory course work (mathematics, science and technical work) for your desired major rather than on IGETC completion.

Additional breadth coursework may be required after enrollment at BCOE.\nPrerequisites\nStrong technical preparation is essential for success in the admissions process and, subsequently, in all coursework at BCOE. If you intend to transfer to an engineering major, you are expected to complete the equivalent of UCR coursework required in the first two years of the programs and apply for transfer starting your junior year.
