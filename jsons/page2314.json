William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board have selected Brown University professor Jimmy Xu for the Fulbright-Tocqueville Distinguished Chair Award.\nThe prestigious award will enable Xu, a professor of engineering and physics, to study and teach at JUNIA, a graduate school of science and engineering\u00a0located in Lille, France, and at the CNRS Institute of Electronics, Microelectronics and Nanotechnology based at the University of Lille.\nXu works in the field of laser science, nanotechnology and nanoelectronics, with current research focused on quantum photonics and electronics. He has been collaborating with French researchers for nearly a decade.\n\"I am thrilled to have the opportunity and the honor to deepen and expand the explorations we have begun with some of the world's best scholars and scientists who happen to reside in France,\" Xu said. \u201cI am hoping we can make some headway in the exploration of spin-momentum locking, single-electron synapses and superconductive phase transitions through joint efforts with French colleagues in the spaces of quantum sensing, neuromorphic computing and quantum simulations.\u201d\nThe Fulbright-Tocqueville Distinguished Chair Award was created in 2005 in commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the 19th century French historian and political theorist Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s birth and the 100th anniversary of U.S. Sen. J. William Fulbright\u2019s birth. The Fulbright program is overseen by the U.S. Department of State. The award aims to reinforce collaborative research between the United States and France in all fields of study.\nFulbright winners engage in cutting-edge research and expand their professional networks, often starting research collaborations abroad and laying the groundwork for future partnerships between institutions. Participants share their stories and often become active supporters of international exchange upon returning to their home countries, institutions, labs and classrooms. Afterwards, they often invite foreign scholars to their campus and encouraging colleagues and students to go abroad.\u00a0\nFulbright-Tocqueville alumni include 62 Nobel Prize laureates, 89 Pulitzer Prize recipients, 78 MacArthur Fellows and thousands of leaders across the private, public and non-profit sectors. Stephen Porder, a Brown professor of ecology, evolution and organismal biology, and of environment and society, was awarded the Fulbright-Tocqueville Distinguished Chair Award in 2020.\nXu will begin his work in France in January 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTags\n\nAwards and Fellowships\nFaculty and Staff\nResearch\nSchool of Engineering\n\n\n\n\nRelated news:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Science and Technology\n\n\nFour years later, AI language dataset created by Brown graduate students goes viral\n\n\n\n\n\n April 25, 2023\n\n  Thanks to the popularity of new AI-powered chatbots and technology, Brown alumni Aaron Gokaslan and Vanya Cohen are seeing newfound interest in their dataset replicating OpenAI\u2019s language processing model GPT-2.\n\n\nRead Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen details for Four years later, AI language dataset created by Brown graduate students goes viral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Science and Technology\n\n\nOn the eve of Earth Day, Brown climate scientist outlines solutions for a warming world\n\n\n\n\n\n April 20, 2023\n\n  Kim Cobb, a Brown University professor and director of the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society, spoke about the need to act on climate change, urging that action must be taken collaboratively and equitably.\n\n\nRead Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen details for On the eve of Earth Day, Brown climate scientist outlines solutions for a warming world\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Science and Technology\n\n\nWomen university presidents, engineering deans issue open letter supporting CHIPS and Science Act\n\n\n\n\n\n April 20, 2023\n\n  The 13 signatories, including Brown\u2019s Christina H.
