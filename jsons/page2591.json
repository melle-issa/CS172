Based on feedback from the last chat, @harishanker (I) prepared a draft plan for an MVP, which is as follows:\u00a0\nA short cohort of new contributors (mentees) and experienced contributors (mentorsMentor Someone who has already organised a WordCamp and has time to meet with their assigned mentee every 2 weeks, they talk over where they should be in their timeline, help them to identify their issues, and also identify solutions for their issues.) are to be brought together in a dedicated space (potentially a SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform https://slack.com/. The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at https://make.wordpress.org/chat/. channel in Make/WordPress) to work together for a certain period (two to four weeks)\nDuring this time, mentees will learn pre-prepared training material (we can start with existing contributor courses in Learn WordPress)\nEach mentee will be assigned a mentorMentor Someone who has already organised a WordCamp and has time to meet with their assigned mentee every 2 weeks, they talk over where they should be in their timeline, help them to identify their issues, and also identify solutions for their issues., with whom they will be having at least two 1:1 mentoring sessions (over text chat and/or video).\u00a0\nAdditionally, the group will have at least three group mentoring sessions on broad contribution topics (over text or video)\nOptionally, they will create a three-month contribution and learning plan with their chosen mentor.\u00a0\nOnce all the courses and training sessions are complete, mentees graduate from the program, and are pointed to the Make/Team of their choosing for further contribution. Ideally, they are also connected with a contributor (or group of contributors) from the Make/Team of their choice who will go on to support them (informally) in their contributor journey.\u00a0\nWhile the mentorship program will wrap up after the period, mentees can continue to reach out to their cohort and mentors for ongoing guidance and support.\u00a0\nAt the chat, group members shared the following feedback on the program:\u00a0\nFolks generally were in agreement with the program, and we decided to move ahead.\u00a0\nStarting somewhere is the most important part. It was suggested that we try something, find out what\u2019s missing or what doesn\u2019t work and then iterate.\u00a0\nThe fact that proceeding without everything in place is usually helpful for an MVP was also shared. As long as mentors and mentees are willing to work through the kinks and growing pains, this helps us identify where we are lacking and where we are strong. Even when we know what we are strong or weak. This intentional incompleteness will help folks provide feedback which will help us iterate further.\nNext steps\nDistilling feedback from this chat, @harishanker will create a detailed draft MVP document for this program that will be shared with all group members. After making any necessary changes to the document based on the feedback, the proposal will be shared in public. Based on the MVP, the group will start assigning roles and will formally start working on this program.\nWe also informally asked if any group members would like to be mentors, many folks signed up for the same.At this chat, the group also decided to keep meeting on the third Thursday of each month, at the same timings (07:00 UTC and 16:00 UTC), while attempting to work asynchronously to address any group needs.\nNote: In addition to the points mentioned above, there was a detailed discussion on various aspects of the program MVP.

It is how the front end of an application (think \u201cphone app\u201d or \u201cwebsite\u201d) can communicate with the data store (think \u201cdatabase\u201d or \u201cfile system\u201d) https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/..\u00a0\u00a0\nBetter Engagement Strategy to Grow Your Group\nEven if you host the most jaw-dropping events, it\u2019s still important to keep group members involved between meetings to maximize engagement year-round.

They often accompany larger WordCamps, but are sometimes planned along smaller ones or even as ad-hoc events with specific focuses. People at all experience levels, backgrounds, specialties, etc. are welcome.\nFor larger or flagship (US, Europe, Asia) camps, various Make WordPress teams (CoreCore Core is the set of software required to run WordPress. The Core Development Team builds WordPress., Community, Documentation, Polyglots, etc.) will have designated table leads to help orchestrate focused discussions or efforts. However, at many events the overwhelming majority of time at contributor dayContributor Day Contributor Days are standalone days, frequently held before or after WordCamps but they can also happen at any time. They are events where people get together to work on various areas of https://make.wordpress.org/ There are many teams that people can participate in, each with a different focus. https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/contributor-day/ https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/getting-started/getting-started-at-a-contributor-day/. is usually spent in one of two areas:\nHelping people decide which team\u2019s mission and work speaks to them and fits their skill sets or passions\nOnboarding people interested in specific teams in order to get started contributing\nWhile these areas are very valuable and there should always be some amount of this at Contributor Days, it\u2019s not necessarily the best use of the very limited amount of face to face time contributors have together in person. Even new contributors tend to get frustrated with the amount of time onboarding takes to reach a state where they can actually start contributing.\n\nI fielded a unique request/feedback today from a new contributor. She indicated it took half the day to get everyone set up, then it was lunchtime, and after lunch people were getting sleepy. Add in that it took folks a while to rotate around through different teams to find what really spoke to them.\u00a0 She wished we had a 2nd day for contribution time. I wonder if we could do a new contributor morning and then 1.5 days of actual work time for intl camps.\nFeedback Courtney Robertson(@courane01) shared in the Making WordPress Slack\nWhile adding a day could be an option for some camps to consider, WordCamps are already quite time intensive, even more so for those that have traveled a great distance to attend (which is the majority of attendees for flagship camps). The ability to extend the commitment of attending a WordCampWordCamp WordCamps are casual, locally-organized conferences covering everything related to WordPress. They're one of the places where the WordPress community comes together to teach one another what they\u2019ve learned throughout the year and share the joy. Learn more. by even a half day is also not a privilege that everyone has for a variety of reasons, from financial constraints to social responsibilities. With these complexities in mind, the best ways to improve the effectiveness of Contributor Days will likely need to be focused on the time prior to the events themselves.\nWhat\u2019s Been Tried so Far\nThough there are some planning and onboarding resources shared between WordCamps, they mainly fall into two buckets:\nLogistical planning for organizers\nTeam specific documentation for team/table leads\nThere have also been some new contributor focused resources that have been created for specific events, but few if any have been reused in following events. Here\u2019s a list of a few:\nContributor Orientation Tool (WordCamp Europe)\nContributor Day Handbook\nDocumentation Team WordCamp Asia 2023 resources\nContributor Day information, WordCamp Europe 2021, including working with Make Teams for Office HoursOffice Hours Defined times when the Global Community Team are in the #community-events Slack channel. If there is anything you would like to discuss \u2013 you do not need to inform them in advance.You are very welcome to drop into any of the Community Team Slack channels at any time. / special sessions to help people learn about the teams/ set up ahead of the event\u00a0\nContribute to WordPress area, WCEU 2021 \u2013 to help create a longer term resource on Learn WordPress\nSpecific teams have also created their own team specific resources related to Contributor Day:\nDocumentation Team Orientation Form\nPreparing for a WordCamp Contributor Day blog post (Core team focused, being absorbed in the Core team handbook)\nAfter some back and forth between several contributors involved with many of the tools and efforts above in SlackSlack Slack is a Collaborative Group Chat Platform https://slack.com/. The WordPress community has its own Slack Channel at https://make.wordpress.org/chat/. (@courane01, @desrosj, @oglekler, @st810amaze, @isabel_brison, @milana_cap, @sereedmedia, @harishanker, @webcommsat), the discussion was paused so this post could be published (posts are better at preserving discussions for historical reference).\nSome other points, action items, and takeaways from the discussion so far (which you\u2019re encouraged to go read in full):\nAll contributors can benefit from better documentation and onboarding any day of the year, not just Contributor Days.\nEncouraging contributors to prepare for Contributor Day before arriving at the event would make the day itself much more valuable and productive.\nEach team will have its own onboarding process and documentation. This should be compiled in a similar location for every team.\nCollecting all onboarding information in one place will make it easier for Contributor Day organizers to communicate this information to attendees before the event.\nBetter descriptions of team duties and responsibilities with the proper global context would help new contributors determine which team they\u2019d like to contribute to before arriving at the event.\nBetter summaries of the planned activities and focuses for each team at a specific Contributor Day beforehand would make it easier for contributors to determine which team they would like to contribute to before arriving at the event.\nA uniform way to collect this team specific info would really help WordCamp contributor day / event organizers.\nBy Make Teams having more time to plan, they can also plan collaborations or joint discussions with other teams, eg. marketing team and training team have used contributor events to work jointly on tasks or discussions at an event, a suggestion has come from core to work on specific old tickets which attendees could read about before the event and may be relevant for other teams too\nBigger camps have much greater resources than smaller ones. Documenting and sharing the efforts from larger camps could enable more smaller camps to have Contributor Days, which teams from WordCamp Europe have tried to do.\nContributors that created tools related to Contributor Day have other responsibilities and often are unable to properly maintain them or make them flexible enough for other camps to use.\nSharing information with attendees 1 or 2 weeks prior is likely not enough time (especially camps that require further travel). But sharing 2-3 months in advance is likely too difficult (table leads may not be known, and registration may not have even opened yet).\nAnd finally, some tangentially related items that were mentioned in the discussion:\nProposed WordPress Contributor Mentorship Program\nThoughts & Feedback\nThis post is not only meant to document the discussion and several action items that were identified, but also to gather any feedback from the wider community and volunteers with an interest in helping to complete the related initiatives.

This week, we go the next step to try and build an MVP for the Mentorship Program for our project. The idea is to share all the learnings we picked up last week, and use it to shape an experimental mentorship program to test out our idea so that we can iterate and build our learnings. \n3. Next steps and next meetingDepending on the outcome of the discussion, we will decide on the next steps of our meeting. We will aim to kick off some basic ideas in order to create a draft MVP which we can post in the Make/Community blog. We will also try to identify a regular cadence for our chats (that is friendlier for multiple timezones). \nLooking forward to seeing you soon! \n#contributor-working-group #mentorship-program\u00a0#wpcontributors Login to ReplyTo-do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\n\u2190 Older posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearchSearchEmail Updates\n\n\nEnter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmail Address\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJoin 2,309 other subscribers\t\t\t\t\n\n\nIn-person Events are Back\n\n UPDATE: Check out our latest COVID-19 guidelines for in-person events.\n\n\n\n\nMeetups\nWordCamps\nUpcoming Events\nWordCamp Reports\n\n\nLatest Posts\nWordCamp Mentors\u2019 May check-in!May 1, 2023\nX-post: What\u2019s new on Learn WordPress in April 2023May 1, 2023\nRecap of the Diverse Speaker Training group (#WPDiversity) AMER/EMEA on April 26, 2023April 28, 2023\nReport: #WPDiversity Diverse Speaker Workshops December 2022 and January 2023April 27, 2023\nNew Handbook Page: Sharing External Events with Your MeetupApril 26, 2023\n\nTeam Meeting Times\n\n\nCommunity Team Meetings\n\nHeld the first Thursday of every month and twice on the same day to support different time zones.\n\n\n12:00 UTC and 21:00 UTC in #community-team on Slack\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\nGet your questions answered in #community-events on Slack.\nMondays & Wednesdays at 22:00 UTC\nTuesdays & Thursdays at 9:00 UTC\n\n\nDiverse Speaker Training Working Group\n\nMeets every month in #community-team on Slack.\n2nd and 4th Wednesdays \n\nat\u00a017:00 UTC\u00a0(between March 12, 2023 & November 4, 2023)\nat\u00a018:00 UTC\u00a0(November 5, 2023 to March 10, 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Deputy Program\n\nCommunity Deputies are a team of people from all over the world who support WordCamps and Meetups.
