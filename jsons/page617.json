This question weighs on our minds from the time we start kindergarten through high school graduation. However, the puzzle doesn\u2019t quite end there, not for most.\nAccording to CNBC, 53% of Americans who quit their jobs last year made a career change. It\u2019s safe to say that many high school graduates may have difficulty choosing a lifelong career path prior to starting college.\nChapman University offers an Exploratory Majors Program to its undeclared students to help them find inspiration and, eventually, themselves. The program consists of interdisciplinary courses for first-year students, allowing them to try various areas of study. These courses are also referred to as First-Year Focus Courses (FCCs).\nStudents who participate in the Exploratory Majors Program for Undeclared Students are assigned three advisors to aid in their success. This \u201csuccess team\u201d includes their FCC professor, a dedicated academic advisor and a career advisor.\nWhat Is the Undeclared Experience at Chapman?\nStudents are able to take a variety of classes from different majors to help them narrow their choices. \u201cI\u2019m figuring out what I like and what I don\u2019t like,\u201d said Nicholas Falk \u201926, who began attending Chapman in the fall 2022 semester. \u201cI\u2019ve been taking different types of classes to see what\u2019s out there. It\u2019s really allowed me to explore more.\u201d\u00a0\nApplying without a major doesn\u2019t hurt your chances of getting into Chapman. In fact, Chapman offers the following resources for undeclared students:\n\nUndeclared Advising: The Academic Advising Center provides assistance to help students explore and find their major.\nMajors in Minutes: This annual event gives students the opportunity to learn about possible majors from students in those majors in a speed-dating format.\nCareer and professional assessments: Chapman\u2019s Career and Professional Development Office can help you find a career that matches your interests and goals \u2014 and a major to match that career!\n\nGetting Inspired\nWhen students start to gravitate toward specific areas of study, there are campus jobs, events and clubs to fuel the fire of inspiration. \u201cI came to Chapman because Dodge, the film school, is really interesting,\u201d said Faith Nguyen \u201926, who is also an undeclared freshman. \u201cI like going to their events and I\u2019m applying for a job there.\u201d\nNguyen shared that she was recently inspired in a PR class she\u2019s taking through the Exploratory Majors Program \u2014 which could lead to a promising career in advertising in the film industry \u2014 saying, \u201cI think I want to double major in PR and economics.\u201d Economics was always a favorite subject for Nguyen, so she\u2019s excited to utilize that knowledge in a fun way.\nWith over 175 recognized student organizations at Chapman, there is something for everyone to get inspired and involved while finding their major.\nDesigning a Major at Chapman\nA self-designed major is possible for students who draw from more than one traditional discipline. Minors can also be self-designed, as long as Chapman offers the program of study that interests the student. This is perfect for students who wish to cross disciplinary boundaries and construct new forms of knowledge or creative expression.\nDiya Giri \u201926 knew that she wanted to follow in her parents\u2019 footsteps, somehow blending the technical world of her father, a software engineer, and her mother\u2019s creative world as a painter. \u201cMy admission counselor told me I could create whatever I want and, within certain parameters, Chapman would make it happen for me. That\u2019s the biggest reason why I\u2019m here,\u201d she said.\nGiri expressed that Chapman is meeting her needs for her goals to blur the lines between art and technology, saying, \u201cI want to do something with immersive media, like VR, with a focus on immersive experiences for theatres and concerts. Dodge has a strong VR/AR [virtual reality/augmented reality] and VFX [visual effects] program as a minor.\u201d\nFor her major, Giri shared her excitement about taking classes from various schools within Chapman University. \u201cI did a lot of research to figure out how to piece everything together. What was really great is that everything I wanted wasn\u2019t in just one college; there were options throughout almost all of the colleges at Chapman. Counselors were really great about helping me get into those classes and finding ways to connect those within my major.\u201d\nApplying to Chapman as an Undeclared Student\nWhat do you want to be when you grow up? Chapman wants to inspire your answer. Apply undeclared and find yourself as a Chapman Panther!\n\u00a0\n\n\nadvice for new college students Chapman Experience chapman university exploratory majors first-year experience New Students undeclared students \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJennifer Winfield \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Student Takes on Professor in Viral TikTok Challenge\n\n\n\n\n\nAngela Bassett to Speak at 2023 Chapman University Commencement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership That Spans the Campus Jack of all trades Kyle Tanimura is leaving quite the lasting mark on Chapman, where he has taken on multiple leadership roles as a double major in political science and strategic and corporate communication, with a...\n\n\nMay 1, 2023 Jennifer Winfield\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Pacific Islander Desi American Heritage Month Events at Chapman University Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Heritage Month, which runs from May 1 to 31, celebrates the identities, histories and experiences of the APIDA community.
