The table showcases 108 of the most popular free plugins on WordPress.org.\nTen years ago Birchler created a website that showed the most popular plugins in a similar table layout, ranking them by number of active installations. This chart has been updated and is now available at plugintable.com.\n\u201cToday, I am actually \u2018re-introducing\u2019 this project, complete with a modernized look and feel, more curation, and more useful information than before,\u201d Birchler said.\n\nThe website is interactive, so cards can be expanded to see more information about each plugin, including the author, install count, star rating, and the date it was first published.\n\nApproximately 57% of the plugins included have 1 million or more installs, so it gives you a chance to see all of the most successful WordPress.org extensions at a glance. 600k is the lowest number of active installs for plugins included in the chart.\nAfter making the chart, Birchler noted that he was impressed by the stats for the Really Simple SSL plugin, which has more than 5 million active installs and a 5/5-star rating. He also highlighted Site Kit by Google as being the youngest \u201celement\u201d first released in October 2019, with 3+ million active installs in just over three years in the directory. The XML Sitemaps Generator plugin is the oldest among those included, released in 2005 just before Akismet. \n\u201cAnother plugin that has caught my eye is WP Multibyte Patch by @eastcoder, which offers improvements for Japanese sites,\u201d Birchler said. \u201cWith over 1+ million installs it makes me wonder why WordPress core itself doesn\u2019t have better support for multibyte characters.\u201d\nIf you like the Period Table of WordPress Plugins and want to see it hanging on your wall, Birchler has set up a Shopify-powered store where you can purchase a high-quality print version. The poster comes in light and dark modes and is also available framed. He plans to donate the proceeds of the store to the WordPress community.\nCategory: News, PluginsShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Like thisLike Loading\u2026\n\n11\n\n\n\n\t\t11 responses to \u201cPeriodic Table of WordPress Plugins Showcases 108 Most Popular Plugins\u201d\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Fat Brad says: \n\nApril 29, 2023 at 1:44 AM \n\n\nAn interesting list and a great way of displaying things. But a concerning one, the top 5 plugins all owe their position to marketing, preferential placement, and first mover advantage\nLet\u2019s look at it:\nYoast,  a good plugin but overkill for most. Brilliant marketing though and was the first in the field\nJetpack, has useful features but all features have better alternatives. It has its position simply through preferential placement.\nAkismet, an outmoded plugin that only has its position due to preferential placement\nElementor, an okay product when it was best in a niche, now outmoded by Gutenberg. Great marketing though\nContact form 7, okay plugin but now outmoded. No one would seriously suggest it is the best solution today. But has the first mover advantage\nThe repository has serious problem, you can search for a plugin by its exact name and it won\u2019t appear on the first page of results. Instead popular plugins appear at the top. This is worrying for WordPress as plugin developers are doing great work but are not getting the attention they deserve.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Neo says: \n\nApril 29, 2023 at 11:07 AM \n\n\nTotally agree!\nAnother, I love to see more detail on number of installed websites, not just over 5 millions, orver 3 millions, ..\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Miroslav Glavi\u0107 says: \n\nApril 29, 2023 at 7:07 PM \n\n\nSome of those plugins are popular because they come with the package.\nI wonder how many people would actually download Hello Dolly or Akismet, would they be at all popular if they were not included in the .zip file? I just downloaded it right now to check again.\nYes both Akismet and Hello Dolly are there.\nThe smaller players get drowned by the bigger players.\nI use AntiSpam Bee by the way instead of Akismet. Yes I did fork Hello Dolly to show Spock quotes (Star Trek, not the doctor).\nYoast SEO is popular because whenever you ask for SEO plugin advice\u2026\u2026.Yoast SEO is the one. Forget the other players. Over the years I tried Rank Math, Slim SEO and AIOSEO.\nSame for Security plugin. Same for other categories.\nThe usual: Only (xyz) is the one you should use. Rarely can you have a discussion of the pros and cons of each plugin.\nPeople download because others just mention the name.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Neo says: \n\nApril 30, 2023 at 5:24 AM \n\n\nSurprise Hello Dolly still be there, it\u2019s quite ugly because it is the first thing most of us delete after install WP.\nAbout Akismet, it not the best but still be very helpful.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jonathan says: \n\nApril 30, 2023 at 8:53 AM \n\n\nLike how they\u2019re celebrating 20 years of WordPress and then selling the poster on a shopify site \ud83d\ude02\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Mark says: \n\nApril 30, 2023 at 9:55 PM \n\n\nHonestly from a usability perspective, more than half of these plugins are what I call, Scam plugins that are almost worthless. as others have said, some of these plugins come prepackaged, others are just worthless\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Frank Gomez says: \n\nMay 1, 2023 at 9:24 AM \n\n\nMany of these should not even exist. It demonstrates how many \u201cweb designers\u201d are utterly incompetent and rely too much on plugins, pre-built demo websites and so on. BUT, this is not suprising. See: https://httparchive.org/reports/accessibility?lens=wordpress&start=2018_01_15&end=latest&view=list or https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight?lens=wordpress&start=2018_01_15&end=latest&view=list\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n mark says: \n\nMay 1, 2023 at 7:04 PM \n\n\nNo, you would not believe the number of WordPress warrior \u201cdevelopers\u201d on Reddit, that have a client and are asking how to implement the most  basic features with a plugin, I mean they are so clueless that they cannot even research the proper plugin for a certain functionality.   And there are many many plugin creators that take advantage of newcomers to WordPress by recommending plugins that cause plenty of issues down the line.\nit is disgusting.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scott Kingsley Clark says: \n\nMay 1, 2023 at 9:44 AM \n\n\nNow all it needs is coloring based on what has a commercial pro/service along with it. It continues to be difficult to maintain any popular plugin without some funding. I don\u2019t know if any of these survive solely on donors/sponsors \u2014 perhaps worth looking into.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Richard Ginn says: \n\nMay 1, 2023 at 12:51 PM \n\n\nGreat idea.\nI guess at least half of them have a premium version of the plugin and/or even a premium addon to the plugin so they can make money off of you.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Kev Provance says: \n\nMay 1, 2023 at 11:21 PM \n\n\n\u201d It continues to be difficult to maintain any popular plugin without some funding.\u201d \u2013 I still maintain Redux Framework. It\u2019s strictly a developer\u2019s tool. I can say, unequivocally, this statement is true. Developers are cheap and don\u2019t want to pay for anything (or donate), even when the tool saves them countless hours. I know. I am one.  \ud83d\ude09\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
