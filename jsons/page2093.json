But it\u2019s an illuminating one at Chapman University\u2019s Argyros School of Business and Economics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term describes when something is nine times greater than it once was. At the Argyros School, it comes in handy to quantify the growth of academic publishing by faculty in the past two decades. It\u2019s just one sign of the school\u2019s progress in the 20 years since it took on the name and embraced the vision of The Honorable George L. Argyros \u201959. Among the remarkable indicators are increased student selectivity, a climb in the rankings and growing numbers of alumni rising up in every industry, from technology to international investment.\nStill, the dean of the school can\u2019t resist some fun with the word that says so much about the unique brand of energy fueling the upward trajectory there.\n\u201cI had to learn this term,\u201d Argyros Dean Tom Turk, Ph.D., says with a laugh. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve nonupled our research publishing in the past 20 years. That\u2019s pretty significant.\u201d\nSuch a culture of achievement was precisely what alumnus Argyros envisioned for the school named in his honor. In his remarks during the naming dedication, Argyros called for greatness.\n\u201cDare to dream. Take advantage of the ability to think big and reach high. Be willing to take risks. Fight courageously for the principles you believe in,\u201d Argyros said.\nAs the school marks two decades since its naming, it\u2019s clear that the leadership, faculty, students and alumni have more than delivered on that challenge. Today the Argyros School ranks among the world\u2019s top 100 business schools in U.S. News & World Report rankings, offering eight areas of specialization for undergraduates and five graduate programs. The school graduates some 600 students every year, compared with about 180 two decades ago, and boasts a faculty of nearly 80, including Vernon Smith, Ph.D., Nobel laureate in economics.\nUnderscoring it all is an unmatched student experience. With help from the school\u2019s own career services office, students find meaningful internships. Undergraduates and graduates alike collaborate in small classes taught by faculty who are industry leaders as well as gifted teachers. Also in the classroom are business experts, thanks to a robust schedule of speakers who visit classes throughout the year. Many, including partners with the Big Four accounting firms, even return for mock interviews. None just talk and run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nArgyros School graduate programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n75\nPercentage of employment offers to Argyros School students that are accepted within 90 days of graduation (Class of 2016)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34\nRanking in\nBloomberg\nBusinessweek Best\nUndergraduate\nBusiness Schools,\n2016 (most recent rankings)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n73\nRanking in\nBloomberg\nBusinessweek Best\nU.S. Full-Time MBA\nPrograms, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100+\nOn-campus recruiting\nvisits by employers\neach year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\nDare to dream. Take advantage of the ability to think big and reach high. Be willing to take risks. Fight courageously for the principles you believe in.\u201d\n\u2013 George L. Argyros \u201859\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have influential business leaders who interact with our students in a personal setting. At a bigger university, you\u2019re never going to meet them. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to go for coffee with them and ask them questions,\u201d Turk says. \u201cHere, that\u2019s fairly typical.\u201d\nLife beyond the traditional curriculum and classrooms whirrs with vigor, too. In the Janes Financial Center, students have access to 12 Bloomberg terminals, which they use to oversee the Student Managed Investment Fund. In addition, the students thrive in Research Challenge competitions sponsored by the Chartered Financial Institute (CFA). In fact, they hold a three-year winning streak.\nAnother hallmark is the school\u2019s Economic Science Institute, founded in 2008 and led by Professor Vernon Smith, who received the Nobel Prize in 2002. He is regarded as \u201cthe father of experimental economics,\u201d having formulated and formalized the principles and much of the methodology of that now-thriving discipline.\nThe institute\u2019s widely recognized level of expertise has served to attract additional numbers of prestigious faculty. Moreover, it has made Chapman a hub of experimental economics, and supports its newest minor, humanomics, which explores economics through the lens of the humanities, and humanities through the lens of economics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\nOur alumni provide great connections and intellectual expertise.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nReflecting the entrepreneurial spirit and real estate career that was foundational to its namesake, the Argyros School will introduce an M.S. in real estate beginning in fall 2020.\n\u201cWe have a lot of faculty who do world-class research on real estate topics. A lot of our trustees are people who built Orange County. Our alumni provide great connections and intellectual expertise. We are pulling all that together to become the place that builds the next set of leaders in real estate,\u201d Turk says.\nWith the growth of the school has come leadership in industries. Data is paramount now, which is why the Argyros School continues to grow its computational programs.\nThrough it all, the important principles that George Argyros himself established 20 years ago still endure.\n\u201cGenerally, a business degree isn\u2019t to prepare you for a particular industry,\u201d Turk says. \u201cIt prepares you to think strategically, to support your ideas, analyze them with all the data available and to build consensus, so you can get something done.\u201d\nWhich is exactly what the Argyros School itself has done in abundance over the past two decades. Maybe even nine times over.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20th\n\nAnniversary Celebration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Chapman University School of Business was founded in 1974, but in 1999 it officially became the George L. Argyros School of Business and Economics, thanks to a transformational gift made by Julianne and The Honorable George Argyros \u201959. His generosity set in motion a new era of growth and achievement in business education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This fall, Chapman celebrates this milestone anniversary with a special visit by President George W. Bush, who will be guest of honor at the celebration. In addition to his visionary contributions to higher education, George Argyros was appointed by President Bush and served as U.S. ambassador to Spain and Andorra from 2001-2004.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past year, the Argyros School has welcomed a slate of other distinguished guest speakers whose areas of expertise highlight the interests, impact and contributions of George Argyros.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Conversation About International Economics with Nigel Farage\nIn partnership with the Center for the Study of War and Society in Wilkinson College of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences, the Argyros School welcomed British politician Nigel Farage to campus in October. The visit was made possible by Shannon and George Argyros Jr. \u201989 (JD \u201901). Farage spent time throughout his visit to campus discussing international economics with faculty, students, alumni and special guests.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Conversation About Sports Leadership with Jeanie Buss \nWhen you\u2019re the chief executive officer of one of the most successful NBA teams of all time, you\u2019re bound to have insights into an industry that can turn on player injuries, management changes and fan loyalty. In the spring semester, a joint effort with the Fowler school of Law brought to campus Lakers controlling owner Jeanie Buss, who participated in a wide ranging conversation. Buss offered advice to others aiming for sports management careers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive world out there,\u201d said Buss. \u201cEvery skill set you can acquire is going to help you excel in the career you choose. When you\u2019re young and have the energy, take all the opportunities that you can. Even if it\u2019s something you don\u2019t think you want to do, expose yourself to it so you understand how important it is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Conversation About Leadership with Andrew Card\nAndrew Card, the man who was at President Bush\u2019s side on Sept. 11, 2001, understands what it takes to be a leader in challenging times. In his talk at the Argyros School this spring, the former chief of staff for President Bush told students that leadership begins when other viewpoints are heard.\n\u201cMake the \u2018we\u2019 as inclusive as it can be for our great country. In today\u2019s world \u2018we\u2019 includes more individuals than when the Constitution was written, and it can still be improved and expanded,\u201d said Card, who also served as deputy chief of staff for President George H. W. Bush.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARGYROS FAMILY\nA Tradition of Leadership\n\nTake a stroll through the heart of Chapman University and you\u2019ll see a campus that is transformed because a young couple met 60 years ago at the old Snack Shop on the corner of Chapman Avenue and Shaffer Street.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge L. Argyros \u201959 was already a determined young man, putting himself through college by working long hours at a supermarket while earning a degree in business and economics. But he still had to eat, and it was when he stopped into a restaurant a few blocks from campus that he saw a dark-haired beauty on a date with someone else. They married three years later, in 1962, and today Julianne is president of both Arnel, the company founded by George after graduating college, and the Argyros Family Foundation. Today, Arnel is one of the largest privately owned, diversified real estate and investment companies in the world.\nThe family\u2019s generosity at Chapman is visible. Walk west from the Argyros Forum Student Union and you\u2019ll pass the Julianne Argyros Fitness Center, the Ambassador George L. Argyros \u201959 Global Citizens Plaza and Julianne Argyros Fountain, the Julianne Argyros Orchestra Hall in Musco Center for the Arts, and, of course, the Argyros School of Business and Economics.\nIn the two decades since the business school was named for one of the most successful real estate entrepreneurs in Southern California history, the Argyros School\u2019s reputation has continued to grow. Now Chapman is launching a \u201c50 for 50\u201d campaign. The goal is to propel the Argyros School into the top 50 in the U.S. News & World Report business school rankings by raising $50 million, thus increasing the school\u2019s total endowment to $100 million. (Go to: chapman.edu/asbe20)\n\u201cThe meaning of success for me is giving back,\u201d George Argyros has said. \u201cEvery individual can make a difference. Once you see these young people that we\u2019re helping, and you see the difference you\u2019re making in their lives, it energizes you to want to do more.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nArgyros \u2013 whose business ventures included owning the airline AirCal and Major League Baseball\u2019s Seattle Mariners \u2013 was instrumental in transforming the tiny Chapman College he attended into a bustling university. After becoming a member of Chapman\u2019s Board of Trustees in 1973, he left an indelible impact as the longest-serving chairman of Chapman\u2019s board, leading it from 1976-2001. He resigned to serve President George W. Bush as U.S. ambassador to Spain and Andorra from 2001-04 and remains an emeritus chair of the Chapman board.\nCarrying on the vision of Julianne and George, daughter Lisa Argyros \u201907 is a current Chapman trustee. Son George Argyros Jr. \u201989 (JD \u201901) supports the Board of Counselors for the Argyros School and is a Chapman President\u2019s Cabinet member. Another daughter, Stephanie Argyros, is a University of Southern California trustee.\nThe family has supported education, the arts and other philanthropic efforts not only throughout Southern California but across the nation with an extraordinary array of major gifts. For example, the Argyros Family is participating in the University of Southern California\u2019s restoration of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and its iconic peristyle end, where the flame was lit for the 1932 and 1984 Olympic Games. The many Orange County institutions that have benefited from the Argyros family\u2019s philanthropy include the Segerstrom Center for the Arts, CHOC Children\u2019s Hospital, the Richard Nixon Foundation, Discovery Science Center, South Coast Repertory, the Orangewood Foundation, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts and the Orange County School of the Arts.\nNational efforts have included support of the George W. Bush Presidential Center and the Horatio Alger Association, of which George Argyros is chairman emeritus. A $15 million gift to the organization from the Argyros family helped launch a national college scholarship program for veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nOther beneficiaries of the couple\u2019s generosity are far too many to list.\nAs former President George H.W. Bush once said of Ambassador Argyros in a video tribute: \u201cGeorge, how proud you must be. Your example is the kind of volunteer spirit that truly epitomizes the concept of being one of a thousand points of light.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than One Path to a Doctorate at Chapman\n\n\n\n\n\nVaccination Is Best Protection Against Measles, Say Chapman Health Experts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Asia-Pacific Initiative Offers Unique Take on Hotbed Region Growing up in Los Angeles, Robert Koepp became fascinated with Asia.
