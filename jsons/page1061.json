To become a WGS major fill out a Change of Major form on the Registrar's webpage.\n\nWGS Professors- Dr. Charlene Tung, Dr. Don Romesburg, and Dr. Lena McQuade \nMajors in WGS and minors in WGS and Queer Studies learn about:\nSocial, political, and cultural dimensions of gender and inequity.\nHow gender structures everything from our innermost sense of self to transnational circuits of society and economy.\nIntersectional perspectives, which means how gender is co-constituted with race, ethnicity, sexuality, nation, ability, and other forms of social power.\nInterdisciplinary approaches that examine social structures, institutions and ideologies of gender through social, historical, political, legal, and cultural lenses.\nHow to apply what you are learning through research, internships, and career planning.\nStudents in WGS get close mentorship from award-winning faculty and join a community of scholarship and engagement with their fellow WGS classmates.\u00a0 WGS graduates have gone into a wide range of fulfilling professional and community service roles in: social work, non-profit leadership, law, ethnic studies, human resources, education, counseling, student services, urban planning, art, healthcare, business, and more.\nJoin us in WGS!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWGS Home\nMission & Goals\nDegree Programs\nWGS Advising\nOur Faculty\nCourses\nInternships\nWGS Lecture Series\nWhat Can I Do With a WGS Degree?\nStudent Resources & Activities\nOur History\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFacebook for WGS \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Now \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI like how we have a lot of support with the faculty and with each other.

They're so open-minded about different perspectives and different understandings of the world. Don, Charlene and Lena are a power trio.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiovanna Castellanos\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI like how well I do in the classes and I like how accessible information is. It's giving me the language to talk about the world around me and talk about the big issues and to really step back and be able to question others and understand.\n\n\n\n\n\nMegan Monroe\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI'm going to use my degree. The lens that I have built through my WGS classes is always going to be with me.... I plan to use the critical thinking that WGS has given me in every aspect of my life, always.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarly Solberg\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nI just really want to help people and that's really broad. But whatever that looks like is okay with me- social work, counseling, working for a non-profit....I just want to reach my hand out in any way possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKendall Andrews\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nPrevious Next \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Where to Find  \n\n\nAdvising\nClass Schedules \nContact Us\nFaculty \nInternships\nLecture Series \nMajor & Minor Information\nOffice Hours \nStudent Resources \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStevenson Hall \n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Avenue\nStevenson Hall 3115\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSU Facebook\nSSU Twitter\nSSU Instagram\nSSU Youtube\nSSU News RSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Ave\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n707.664.2880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia State University\nContact SSU\nUniversity Policies\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSafeSSU\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\nEmergency Information\nJobs\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
