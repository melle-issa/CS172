I\u2019d definitely recommend\n                                                it to other students!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s an opportunity to get classes finished quickly. Also allows for a lighter class\n                                                load during the regular semester.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because the classes are usually small in size, I was able to sit down with my professors\n                                                one on one to go over the material.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many classes are offered online, so for someone who lives three hours away, such\n                                                as myself, this is a great opportunity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The summer break is long, so why not spend some amount of time on studying in order\n                                                to graduate sooner.\"\n\n\n\n\n  Previous    Next \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions?\nIf you have any questions about Summer Session, send us a note and we will get back\n                           to you soon.\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis site is maintained by Extension and International Programs.\nMailing Address:\u00a0 800 N.
