For these families\u2014and more than 177,000 alumni\u2014Chico State is not just a university or campus. It is the branches of the family tree. This is\u00a0one of six profiles\u00a0of families who are rooted in their Wildcat connection.\nWhen the Gallagher twins\u2014Jim and Jerry\u2014walked onto the pitch after spending the summer of 1967 working at University Farm, first-year Head Soccer Coach Don Batie says they were badly in need of haircuts. He took them into his office and shaved their heads.\n\nMike and Pat O\u2019Malley.

Pat joined the team six years later.\nBy the time the Mitchell brothers\u2014Mike, Paul, and G.G.\u2014were all starters for the 1980 Wildcats, the list of siblings who had competed for the Chico State men\u2019s soccer program was growing as quickly as the mullets they sported.\nToday, 13 sets of siblings have donned the cardinal and white of the Wildcats, and the program\u2019s legacy is becoming intergenerational as new sons and nephews follow family footsteps onto the training field.\nCurrent student-athletes Preston and Josh Moll were babes in arms when they visited Chico to watch their uncle Mike (Moll) play.\n\nMike Moll, right, with Preston and Josh Moll.

Jordan\u2019s uncle, Ed, played at Chico State, too.\nNick Lopez was the latest to join his father on the program\u2019s all-time roster. On a cool fall evening in 2018, he stood in the middle of University Soccer Stadium with the arms of his father Johnny (1984\u201385) and Mike O\u2019Malley around his shoulders. Nick was the first recipient of the Brothers O\u2019Malley Scholarship, formed by a group of alumni in honor of Pat, who died of brain cancer at 41. Having grown up around the program, Lopez was awestruck by the significance of it all.\n\u201cI was touched,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like (Pat and I) have similar spirits. Thanks to my dad and the time I have spent around the program, I have a lot of old-school Chico State heritage and culture in my bones. So, I know how important Pat\u2019s legacy is to the program. And of course, I know what my father\u2019s legacy is. He inspired me to make an impact on the program. It was a full-circle kind of moment, and I\u2019ll never forget it.\u201d\n\n\nShare this Article\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tLuke Reid\t\t\n\n\n\t\tLuke Reid (History, '04; Kinesiology, '09) is a content producer for University Communications.\t\n\n\n\n\nMost Popular \n\n\t\t\t\t\tBusiness Double Major Ready for Life\u2019s Next Big Challenge\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tExpanded CalFresh Eligibility Brings Food Access to More Chico State Students\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWorth Sharing: Health Services Administration College Bowl Team Scores Wins\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLife of Hard Work Pays Off for Agricultural Business Major\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRooted in Connection: The Wildcat Family Tree\t\t\t\t\n\n\nSubscribe to Chico State Today\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tType your email\u2026\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWe are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nChico State Today is an official site of California State University, Chico.\nReport an accessibility issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChico State\n\n\n\nCalifornia State University, Chico\n400 West First Street\nChico, CA 95929\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCopyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose Subscribe Pop-Up\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tClose Subscribe Pop-Up\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
