All of our programs are accredited by the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs.\nTeachers provide developmentally appropriate experiences in math, science, language, art, music, motor skills and social/emotional skills. They use a range of learning materials including books, puzzles, computers and art materials with regular access to outdoor play equipment. Teachers follow a daily schedule, prepare weekly lesson plans and conduct two parent-teacher conferences each year. Parents receive a written progress report at the end of each year.\nWe provide breakfast, lunch and a morning and/or afternoon snack. Our active parent association meets regularly to plan family-oriented events and fundraisers. Students and researchers are welcome at ECS, which features observation rooms that are available to parents as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFee Schedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfant Program\n(Ages 2-18 months)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMonthly Fee\n\n\nSchedule\nStudent\u00a0Subsidized\nUCR\u00a0Staff\u00a0&\u00a0Faculty\nCommunity\n\n\n\n\n5\u00a0Days\u00a0(M-F)\n$1,105\n$1,670\n$1,985\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToddler Program\n(Ages 18-36 months)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMonthly Fee\n\n\nSchedule\nStudent\u00a0Subsidized\nUCR\u00a0Staff\u00a0&\u00a0Faculty\nCommunity\n\n\n\n\n5\u00a0Days\u00a0(M-F)\n$1,050\n$1,565\n$1,920\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreschool Program\n(Ages 3-5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMonthly Fee\n\n\nSchedule\nStudent\u00a0Subsidized\nUCR\u00a0Staff\u00a0&\u00a0Faculty\nCommunity\n\n\n\n\n5\u00a0Days\u00a0(M-F)\n$785\n$1,060\n$1,330\n\n\n3 Days\u00a0(MWF)\n$530\n$700\n$855\n\n\n2 Days\u00a0(TR)\n$370\n$490\n$585\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKindergarten Program\n(5 years by September 1st)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMonthly Fee\n\n\nSchedule\nStudent\u00a0Subsidized\nUCR\u00a0Staff\u00a0&\u00a0Faculty\nCommunity\n\n\n\n\nEnrichment Program (Full Day 7:30-5:30 pm)\n\n\n5 Days\u00a0(M-F)\n$1,000\n$1,000\n$1,295\n\n\nKinder Academy (School Day 7:30-2:30 pm)\n\n\n5 Days\u00a0(M-F)\n$750\n$750\n$965\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHours of Operation\nFull Day Program\n7:30 am - 5:30 pm\nFull Day Kindergarten\n7:30 am - 5:30 pm\nSchool Day Kindergarten\n8:30 am - 2:30 pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChild Care Applications\n\n\n\n\nWaiting List Inquiries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Our Staff\n\n\n\n\nCurriculum\n\n\n\n\nClass Schedules\n\n\n\n\nWhat To Expect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nUC Riverside's Early Childhood Services is proud to be fully accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children.\n \n\nWe believe that children learn best in an environment that is safe, nurturing and child-centered.
