They also highlight how managed hosting can help businesses focus on their core operations while leaving the technical aspects to the experts. \n\nEstimated Reading Time:  24 minutes\n\n\nTranscript \u2193\nCory Miller is joined by Jess Friedman from WP Cloud discuss how hosting companies can improve their infrastructure and services to provide better performance and reliability to their customers. They also dive into the importance of customer support, the benefits of using managed hosting services, the ethics of data collection, and more. The experience and expertise offered are sure to inspire you to increase your standards of service\nTop Takeaways:\n\nOutsourcing Infrastructure. WordPress hosting companies can benefit from outsourcing their infrastructure to specialized providers such as WP Cloud. This can free up their customer support team from dealing with infrastructure-related issues and enable them to focus on providing better customer service and value-added services.\nIncrease Customer Satisfaction. By democratizing publishing and providing a superior WordPress experience, hosting companies can reduce churn and retain customers who may otherwise switch to other platforms if their WordPress experience is subpar.\nSet Up for Speed. While many factors can impact website speed, some of the most important ones include optimizing images, using a content delivery network (CDN), and minimizing the use of plugins. By focusing on these areas, WordPress agencies can help their clients improve their website speed and ultimately provide a better user experience for their visitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude4f Sponsor: A2 Hosting\nA2Hosting offers solutions for WordPress and WooCommerce that are both blazing fast and ultra-reliable.

I\u2019ve got a longtime friendof mine in the WordPress space. I think we met like 10 years ago, Jesse. Um, but we\u2019re gonnabe talking about WP Cloud today, and this is part of our product people series. Um, I heardabout WP Cloud, I know Jesse and I was like, Hey, I wanna know more about WP Cloud.It\u2019s really compelling from what I\u2019ve heard. Um, but first and foremost, welcome to the podcast.Jesse. Could you tell us a little bit about your.Jesse Friedman: Yeah. Thanks Corey. And yeah, it probably has been a decade. It\u2019s, it\u2019s, uh,it\u2019s awesome to, to be able to, uh, know people like you and be able to work with people like youfor so long.Um, and that\u2019s one of the great things about the WordPress community, right? Oh, yeah. Uh,yeah. So, uh, I, I, uh, got started in WordPress, geez, back in 2005, I think. Uh, I was, uh,working as a professor at a university and, uh, trying to teach, [00:01:00] uh, students, uh, wellactually I was a student at the time and then later I became a professor and started teachingWordPress.Uh, but my professor, Hillary Mason, who\u2019s actually, used to work at Bitly and is pretty worldrenowned, uh, data scientist. She, she turned me onto WordPress and, uh, I never looked back.Uh, prior to that I was building like static websites. Um, and, uh, and WordPress, uh, is not just apiece of software, right?It\u2019s a community of people that, uh, help to kind of raise the level of everyone who works on it.Um, and that, that\u2019s where I got my career jump off. It was, uh, it was definitely with WordPressfor sure. That\u2019s awesome.Cory Miller: Well, we met when you\u2019re part of Brute Protect and uh, I was asking in the pre-rollabout your art in the background.I\u2019m a big fan of art. Yeah. I wanna get some from the walls, but tell me, tell me more about theart in the background cuz I was like, Hey, we met when you were part of Brute Protect before itwas acquired by automatic. And you kind of pointed to the [00:02:00] lightning in the back. So,yeah, tell me more.Jesse Friedman: Yeah. So actually before we jump in here, this is an not an, uh, chronologicalorder, but I was actually working for a company called Astonish, uh, where I actually got to builda, a, a large web team.I actually still work with one colleague from that company, Jeff Kalinsky. He works at Automaticnow. Uh, when we were tasked with building, um, or converting a. source.net based cms, uh,from an old product called Blue Squid, uh, to a new WordPress powered multi-site. And it wasgonna house like 4,000 sites.Um, and so we, I found this at like a art show. Uh, bought it, hung it on the wall, and uh, and wespent a year building this new platform. The funny thing about it, this is a really unique story.Didn\u2019t give us access to the source files. Uh, and they kind of held everything hostage. This thirdparty company that we were host, host, hosting everything with.Um, so we actually had to build a, like a [00:03:00] w get scraper. To scrape our own websitesand convert them into WordPress themes. So we didn\u2019t even like turn them into Ion out, weturned them into full blown WordPress themes on a multisite. And, uh, we were able to move allthose sites over very quickly. Um, and so I asked that same artist, I said, Hey, can you paint a, aharpoon now that Blue Squid is dead?It\u2019s this old product. And so we hung that up on the wall and that, and that was that. I left thatcompany and co-founded Brew Protect. Uh, brew Protect was a cloud powered. Um, Uh, botnetprevention service. So like anyone who\u2019s trying to brute force into your website, we used, uh,data that we would gather from attack vectors from different various, uh, areas.And it was really the first time that I was able to say like, we\u2019re building something that leveragesinformation that we gained from multiple hosting partnerships to better the entire WordPresscommunity. Because everything that was happening before then was hosts would gather attackvectors against their own infrastructure, and that was the only thing they could [00:04:00] learnfrom.But what we did was we grabbed that information from across different hosting companies, uh,across customers who were around the globe, and we were able to really do a better job of\nthwarting those attacks. Um, and so that represents cloud data raining down on a, a botnet, uh,going outta business there.And then, uh, yeah, and so then we got, uh, acquired by Automatic back in 2014, and I joinedthe Jet Pack team. Uh, I\u2019ve been working on hosting partnerships and. Product development forJet Pack for almost nine years now. And, uh, then we started, uh, you know, launched WP Cloudlast year.Cory Miller: So it has been 10 years.Because I met you all right before the automatic acquisition. Acquisition. Yeah. Yeah. Um, man,well, some nostalgia there. Um, so what\u2019s, what\u2019s, uh, really compelling, what you just said too,is Jet. So when I knew you all got required and got got to meet you and Sam [00:05:00]Hotchkis, and then at some point I realized, Sam, and you were on the jet pack team and at Ithewe.Felt like we were competitors to Jet Pack in many ways, um, from backups and security. And Iwas like, oh no, these, these guys are gonna take jet pack to the next level. And I\u2019ve definitelyseen, I think, what is probably the product of your work over the years where it\u2019s like, oh no.Okay, Sam, Jesse getting in there, um, with Jet Pack.So, uh, that\u2019s a, I wanted to mention that cuz I\u2019ve thought that many times. I think I\u2019ve expressedthat to Sam. Um, but. Anyway, thanks for that background. That\u2019s, that\u2019s really compelling. Backto the old static h CML days. Woo. Thanks WordPress. Yeah. So Jesse, let\u2019s talk about WPCloud. I know, um, we\u2019ve talked a couple times about this and I, what, I know I can throw this atyou and you\u2019ll, you just, you just hit it out of the part and, uh, but tell me really succinctly, whatdo you [00:06:00] think? What is WP Cloud?.Jesse Friedman: WP Cloud is a WordPress focus cloud platform that we built within automaticto power the highest and most trafficked websites in the world. Um, and to provide a very uniquesolution, uh, that gets very close to, if not a hundred percent up time. Um, and so we\u2019re doingsomething that\u2019s a little bit different than what you see with other cloud platforms.We provide vertical scaling and automated real-time fail. So what we want to do is provide asolution that, again, is 100% WordPress focused, but allows you to stop thinking about hostingaltogether. You don\u2019t have to worry about it anymore. We\u2019re gonna take care of all theinfrastructure, keep it up and running, keep it high performance, and, uh, let hosting companiesor others focus on what they do best, um, to provide a, a fantastic experience to customer.Cory Miller: Well, anytime you say something around wordpress.com infrastructure, I alwaysgo, holy [00:07:00] cow. Yeah. When you can say, pretty near, I know you\u2019re being humbled too,but like that, that system is renowned because it\u2019s incredible. I mean, people that work on, uh,the platform and what it does, but. Now, who\u2019s it? Who\u2019s it really for?When you think about WP Cloud, you kind of maybe mentioned this, but I wanna drill down onthat. Who do you think it\u2019s really for?Jesse Friedman: Yeah. All right. So if we look at the actual, uh, hosting, uh, platform itself, it\u2019sfor anyone who wants to have high availability, high performant websites. Uh, but if we look atthe brand WP Cloud, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve decided to take, um, the entire platform and, andgive.A brand that we can then go to hosting companies with and, and provide services to hostingcompanies. So WP Cloud is not interested in individual customers, uh, small agencies, thingslike that. What we\u2019re actually interested in doing is providing services to hosting companies[00:08:00] to help them provide. Better hosting.Um, you can think about WP Cloud as a utility service, like the electrical grid underground, uh,providing services to customers all, all around the globe. But, um, allowing those hostingcompanies to, uh, maintain their experience, the things that differentiate themselves, all of. But ifyou\u2019re, if you\u2019re listening to this and you\u2019re thinking, oh, I have one website or 10 websites and Iwant to host them and I don\u2019t want to have to worry about, um, downtime or, or speed issues oranything like that, I would suggest going straight to one of WP Cloud\u2019s partners, pressable, forexample.Mm-hmm.Cory Miller: So when we were prepping for this, I said, Hey, so this, this pa uh, this isleveraging the.com platform, and you corrected me. Share a little bit more about that.Jesse Friedman: Yeah, sure. So, uh, so what we did was we took the minds and, and thepeople behind wordpress.com powering hundreds of millions of sites there.\nWe took the [00:09:00] same, um, experienced individuals who were helping to power some ofthe, um, most powerful websites on v i p. Uh, we took the experience that we had from RunningPressable, which is, um, like a, uh, a managed WordPress host that we, uh, use to, um, really.Test and grow our own product base. And so we took all those things and we said, what, howcan we build a cloud platform that\u2019s gonna service all of the needs that we have internally, um,and, and provide the absolute best experience?And so when we did that, we ended up launching, uh, what we called internally, uh, productcalled Atomic, uh, and that is now powering uh, wordpress.com business and e-commerceplans. Pressable News Pack. And so that was, uh, similar to like how a w s got born. You know,a, uh, Amazon was an e-commerce platform that was dealing with scale issues.They couldn\u2019t compensate for [00:10:00] the amount of the influx of traffic, so they had to reallysit down and think about how they can rebuild their entire platform. Um, and so then that\u2019s howaw w s was born. It\u2019s not too dissimilar from what we\u2019re doing. We have built a platform that isnow powering, um, 13 billion page views.Um, and, uh, with sites that are experiencing incredibly fast speed under load. Um, and, andnow we\u2019re saying to ourselves like, well, we know we built something amazing here. We knowthat it\u2019s something that we can really give back to the community as a way to raise the bar forcloud hosting across, across the board.Um, and so now that, that is the, that is the effort there is we\u2019ve powered. Internally what weneed to, to make sure that everything runs smoothly. So again, if anybody wants to try out WPCloud, sign up for a wordpress.com business site, sign up for pressable. Um, you\u2019ll feel thespeed, [00:11:00] uh, the proof is in, in the, uh, experience right there.Um, but then WP Cloud is really now focused on how it can provide services to hosting.Cory Miller: Yeah. I love that I\u2019ve observed from the industry being in as long as both of us havethat, you know, there was this day where you started seeing some of the really big hostingcompanies start go moving. There WordPress stuff over to the cloud.Yeah, there\u2019s a lot of bumpy roads along that way, but um, your comparison with aws forinstance, cuz I\u2019ve heard Google Cloud, aws, some of those offerings kind of moving over andthat\u2019s the way it feels like it\u2019s shifting. I\u2019m not a technical person, but I\u2019ve been in the space along time and I go, it makes sense to have cloud-based hosting, especially for WordPress.And then you get specific WordPress expertise. That knows that application better than anybodyI\u2019d, I\u2019d, I\u2019d challenge anybody to say, do you know more about WordPress and automatic teams?Yeah. Um,Jesse Friedman: we definitely leveraged our, our own internal expertise to solve for that. And,and you\u2019re right. I [00:12:00] mean, you look at hosting companies and they\u2019re trying to figureout ways to differentiate themselves outside of the infrastructure.A lot of them are moving to Google Cloud or aw. Um, the shared hosting is still, you know,mostly the same kind of solution, um, that everyone is kind of racing to the bottom on pricing on.Mm-hmm. Um, and so, so how are hosts differentiating themselves? Well, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019smade on top of promises of speed and performance and, and security.But the reality of the situation is the, the infrastructure underneath is actually not. That different.So hosting companies are really focused on trying to differentiate themselves now in the way inwhich they market themselves. The onboarding experience that provide the partnerships thatthey can leverage to provide a better experience to customers.The speed at which you can launch your site, the customer service, those are all things thatHUS hosting companies really f are, are focused on, and. Frankly, the places where they can,they can really win. One of the conversations I had at cloudfest, uh, which was a conferencethat we went to, um, [00:13:00] two weeks ago, was about the power of diversity within hosting.Um, and so I think that it\u2019s really important to recognize that, especially when we\u2019re talking aboutWP Cloud, helping to power those hosting companies in terms of like a utility. Um, you look atsomething like shop. And or, or w and they have these global solutions for every single, um,customer across the world.Um, but you know, we, we know why that\u2019s not, uh, advantageous and why WordPress is better.But one of the major advantages that WordPress has is that, um, the hosting companies candefine the niche that they wanna solve. They can solve problems specific for geographicallylocations. WordPress has seeded itself into hosting companies around the globe.\nSo the solutions you get from a hosting company in let\u2019s say the Netherlands, is completelydifferent than what you might get in Malaysia or Africa. Um, and so that\u2019s an advantage that thathosting companies have in that diversity. And so, uh, you know, if we can come [00:14:00] inand try to help and provide better services at that infrastructural, Then that frees those hostingcompanies up to think about ways in which they can differentiate themselves and provide theabsolute best experience to those, to those customers.Cory Miller: Take care of wordPress, you got the power of WP Cloud, the.com top experienceand do other stuff on top that adds value for your customers. Yeah, exactly. So. I know havingbeen acquired, our company was acquired by hosting company, uh, been on the inside of thatand realizing how much, you know, they, they really worry all, all hosting companies about price.Um, yeah. Anytime you, you know, c panel was this big conversation in the industry for a longtime because they started cranking at prices and everybody started fleeing because they\u2019re like,they felt held hostage. But I know every penny accounts in hosting. So Can you talk a little bitabout the pricing structure for WP.And I know that this is still early.Jesse Friedman: It is still early, and I [00:15:00] appreciate that and, uh, I probably shy awayfrom getting into the super specifics of pricing right now, but what I can tell you is this, is that theway in which WP Cloud Scales is based on the number of pH p workers, uh, CPUs. Uh, andstorage that you want.And so what we want to create are ways in which hosting companies can come in, um, andcreate bespoke offerings to either power their managed WordPress offering now, or to start byoffering the higher tier hosting that they haven\u2019t been able to offer before. If you look at most ofthe hosting companies in the world, a lot of them cap out at a hundred bucks, 150 bucks amonth.Um, and so then you leave, uh, the super high end. Hosting customers to, to either fend forthemselves with their own cloud platform to go to, uh, you know, higher, higher end managedhosting. Um, or something like W P V I P. What we wanna do is be able to provide services thatgo from that range, from, uh, 25 bucks a month to [00:16:00] $2,000 a month, um, and to beable to provide consistent uptime throughout all of that.So hosting companies will be able to come in and use WP. Um, and, and if they want to go witha lower tier, like two PHP workers, two CPUs, this is getting super technical. That\u2019s still built forlike 400,000 sustained visitors a month, uh, which is gonna compensate for, you know, most.Customers that\u2019s only gonna cost that hosting company a few bucks a month with WP Cloud.Um, and then, and then it scales up from there. And since we\u2019re talking about scaling, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll, I\u2019lljust say one thing is, is that we offer something that\u2019s pretty unique in that we don\u2019t, uh, we don\u2019treserve, uh, we, we don\u2019t have any limitations on visits. So if you take a look at other hostingcompanies, you\u2019ll see that they create, uh, they\u2019ll create really robust, powerful servers.And then they\u2019ll put traffic limits on it. Mm-hmm. I\u2019m thinking of a hosting company right now[00:17:00] that has, um, a robust amount of power, uh, allows for up to 40 WordPress websitesand only, uh, and stops at like 400,000 visits a month. Mm-hmm. Well, if you only have 10,000visits a month, you don\u2019t need all that power anyway.Uh, even if you\u2019re not sharing it across all of those things, that\u2019s just a waste of power. That\u2019s aLamborghini on the, on the back of a flatbed pickup truck. You know what I mean? Like you\u2019renot taking full advantage of that. WP Cloud is gonna come in and, and basically say, uh, we\u2019regoing to create bespokes solutions that are designed to house the amount of traffic that you\u2019re,or serve the amount of traffic that you\u2019re bringing.Uh, but we\u2019re not gonna limit you on, on the amount of traffic that you have there. Um, so thereare no real, uh, traffic limitations with WP Cloud, unlike other hosting companies.Cory Miller: Yeah, it, I don\u2019t know all the specs, but I know enough to go when they put a trafficthing, there\u2019s something underneath that they\u2019re trying to be careful of when they put limits andthings.But, um, [00:18:00] so that, that\u2019s a conversation for another well, unless you.Jesse Friedman: Well, I was just gonna say that it\u2019s a way for them to mitigate their, their, theirrisk and their costs. Yeah. Um, but we, we have built a platform that we know can scale to anyamount of traffic. So, uh, we\u2019re, we\u2019re gonna differentiate ourselves there.\nCory Miller: Yeah. Um, so I think you said fully managed performance security and WordPress.What does that mean?Jesse Friedman: It means that we\u2019re literally gonna take care of it all for you. So in terms ofsecurity, uh, it has built-in backup solutions. So it\u2019s actually pretty unique in the way in which wedo backups. I\u2019m sure we\u2019re gonna touch on automated failovers soon.But the way we do our backups is that we do, um, daily file backups and hourly databasebackups, but we don\u2019t just store that on the same box. What we do is we put it onto another datacenter. On another box that actually has power ready so that we can switch to that if we need to.We can talk about that in a second.Um, but we [00:19:00] do, it comes with s ssl, it comes with, uh, TLS encryption. It comes with,uh, WAF DDoS protection. I\u2019m telling you. Like we harden the heck out of it. Yeah. Um, and thenin, in addition to that, we automatically build in a c. No extra cost. It has a CDN built into it. Um,and it, uh, also resizes your images.So you\u2019re only serving the size of the image that you need high resolution, but you\u2019re not servingthese 10 megabyte images that people upload straight from their phone to their WordPressinstance, right? We\u2019re resizing it and only showing the size that you need for the device that\u2019srequesting it. Uh, we also do, uh, automated caching built in too.Um, and. It\u2019s all run by our team internally, so there is really no tweaking or configuring oranything that you have to do. Um, it\u2019s 100% fully managed outta the box. That also includes themanagement of things like P H p, uh, database. Um, it manages, uh, WordPress core [00:20:00]files, certain plug-ins. It allows for templating and staging.Um, and again, we handle all of that. It\u2019s not, these aren\u2019t things that you\u2019re gonna have to.Cherry pick based on price or anything. It\u2019s all 100% inclusive in the product.Cory Miller: So I, you mentioned principle way earlier. I\u2019m a paying, and I wanna say that reallyloud and clear. I\u2019m a paying customer principle.Yeah. So I\u2019ve seen this, the performance, all these things. And, uh, so that, that\u2019s, that\u2019s prettyawesome. But I, I wanted to push in on that because I\u2019m a, this is my comment, not. But whenyou say managed, you always, I always go, tell me what that really means. Yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s like,you know, the Tommy Boys, like you can slap a label on the side, but it\u2019s, you know, whatactually happens inside.And I think that\u2019s one thing that differentiate, differentiates, uh, any automatic brand is it\u2019s not alabel on the outside. Um, yeah. Okay. So tell me what automated realtime fellows.Jesse Friedman: So we touched on this briefly, right? [00:21:00] So if we, if we back up yourentire site to another location and we put that back up on a box that has power, um, and you\u2019reserving traffic to one location, we can automatically detect some kind of, any kind of issue.So even if there was catastrophic failure, uh, you know, a pipe got cut. Uh, the data centeractually you. We have tons of redundancies in terms of power and things like that, but like, let\u2019sjust say like a volcano erupted or something like that, you know, something really catastrophic.We can in real time redirect that traffic to another data center that already has your site live on itand already has, uh, the, the power behind it.So we can in real time, switch that traffic and people will not experience any downtime. And thatis something that is nearly impossible with other cloud platforms. It is possible, but it\u2019s incrediblyexpensive. And because of the scale that we operate at, uh, and the WordPress efficiency thatwe [00:22:00] have, um, we\u2019ve been able to, to build that into the platform.Cory Miller: See, when you talked about backups earlier, it\u2019s something to know about havinghelped lead our product, uh, for backups. And when you said that one thing, it\u2019s not on thatserver. It\u2019s somewhere else within a vast infrastructure. That\u2019s really compelling to me becausewe would tell customers all the time, don\u2019t just don\u2019t back up on that server because what\u2019s,what\u2019s it gonna do for you when it crashes?Um, so like, I love the secure, the backup feature of that. It\u2019s not just a. A backup if somethinghappens. And this was way before all this technology existed today, but that\u2019s how we got thebackup is like into our product. Is it crashed? We didn\u2019t have, we had backups maybe on thatserver. And literally the hard drive was like capoot.And so that was our mantra. Always remote, offsite, you know, so that you can restore and. IncaseJesse Friedman: we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve seen this, I, I\u2019ll [00:23:00] leave hosting companies names out ofthis, this conversation, but we\u2019ve all seen hosting companies that have had. Catastrophic failure.\nUm, data center fires, for example, things like that.Uh, and if you\u2019re not backing up, this is getting into like a conversation about Jet Pack two, butlike, if you\u2019re not backing up your, your website offsite, you\u2019re susceptible to that. Mm-hmm. Um,and that, that can be, um, unbelievably painful. I can\u2019t tell you how many conversations I hadwith people who say, well, I\u2019ll worry about security later, or I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll, you know, I don\u2019t really careabout backups right now.I just wanna get my site. But all the time you\u2019re investing in that, right? You\u2019re building yourwebsite. Think about the dozens of hours of time that you\u2019re spending tweaking all those things.And if you lose that, it\u2019s, it\u2019s not just catastrophic failure for the host, it\u2019s catastrophic failure forthe site owner too.It\u2019s, it\u2019s incredibly painful and to, you know, some, some people out there have stronger will thanI to start all over from the beginning, but I don\u2019t, but that\u2019s, [00:24:00] sometimes I felt that painyou left with doing.Cory Miller: Yeah, I, I felt that. Yeah. Um, we were, we were scraping. We had some clients atthe time and scraping data from Google Cash to redo websites, and so I felt that pain.Yeah. So we\u2019ve talked about, um, the power, performance, security, all these things that arebaked into WP Cloud, that powers.com business, eCommerce plans. But how about the,Preserving and growing the hosting experience. What are your thoughts on that? So key, keyclient for this is our hosting companies, um, to be able to really leverage all of this for, I mean,when you said utility tool, it really rang a bell for me.It\u2019s like, okay, all of this at a re, very. Reasonable price, and I know they need to talk to youabout all those things. But yeah, let\u2019s, let\u2019s talk about that hosting experience a little bit. Tell me,tell me your thoughts on that related to WP Club.Jesse Friedman: So every single [00:25:00] host that, and I\u2019ve worked with a lot of hostingcompanies, every single host has a unique experience.Uh, the signup flow is typically about the same, but the second that you get into that WordPressinstance being launched, Unique onboarding flows. You get unique sets of tools. Um, thedifferent combinations of the way in which they combine, uh, partnerships they have withsecurity or performance companies.Um, And then the platform, the platform is always really unique. Um, a lot of them are built ontop of cPanel or Plak. I think something like 70, 80% of all hosts use that technology. Mm-hmm.Um, and sometimes you feel it and sometimes you don\u2019t. Like, there are certain hostingcompanies that are just using cPanel.It literally says cPanel and you, and you know what you\u2019re on. But then there are other hostingcompanies that have built a completely custom bespoke solution that\u2019s layered on top of. Nomatter what it is, um, that, that again is how you\u2019re differentiating yourself. Um, so if I look at sixhosting companies that are using the same [00:26:00] basic boxes to do shared WordPresshosting, they\u2019re the only difference.There is price, but we\u2019re all. All hosting companies are racing to the bottom on price, and we\u2019re,we\u2019re talking about a difference of a few bucks a month. Um, so then what is it that you get withthat hosting that\u2019s really gonna differentiate \u2019em? And so most people are either makingdecisions based on the fact that they have a recommendation from a friend, or they\u2019re taking alook at, uh, you know, the, the, the bespoke solutions that are coming bundled with that.The great thing about WP Cloud is that it has no platform. It has no user interface. It is 100%API driven. So for any hosting company to use it, it has to work underneath every single thingthat they\u2019ve already built. Um, and so it can work with C Panel, it can work with Plesk, uh, or itcan work with whatever bespoke solution you have.Um, but your, um, Unveiling of the use of WP Cloud is up to you as a host and company. You[00:27:00] can go one way and say, Similar to, I think like WP Engine does this with like a w s orGoogle Cloud. They say like, you know, proudly like we\u2019re partnered with this company to, tolaunch this. Um, and the same way that Pressable does this with like WP Cloud or Grid Pain,uh, you know, they say proudly powered by WP Cloud.And that\u2019s starting to mean something as we start to have more of these conversations andmore people understand what WP Cloud really is. But, um, WP Cloud also offers a completely.Uh, an option that allows you to basically use our infrastructure without ever mentioning us. Youcould even bring your own IP addresses if you wanted to, um, and then take use of the entire\ninfrastructure underneath it, uh, without having to disclose that it\u2019s not something that\u2019shomegrown.Um, so however the host and company wants to work in that, in that area makes sense to us.Uh, what we want to do is just really. Allow them to refocus their efforts away from things like[00:28:00] managing WordPress or handling security or dealing with uptime. The other thing I\u2019lltalk about too is, um, cost to serve.Cost to serve is something that\u2019s on the mind of every single hosting company. Uh, whenPressable moved onto WP Cloud, we saw a dramatic decrease in, um, support tickets related toanything infrastructure rate, limiting DDoS, anything like. Um, and the same thing withwordpress.com, uh, wordpress.com business and e-commerce customers.They\u2019re not, uh, reaching out and asking for support on anything related to the box or how fasttheir site is performing. What they are asking questions about is more things around how canthey be successful. How can you know what plugins should I use for this? Or, or that that\u2019s yourdecision as a host and company decide pr provide support in that area or not.But I can tell you that when you relieve your host, your, your happiness engineers, yourcustomer service team, from the burden of having to figure out why a site is down or why it\u2019s[00:29:00] performing so slowly, it gives them the ability. You know, focus on what keeps thosecustomers there for the long term, reducing churn, which is what every host and company thinksabout.Pressable had something like 36,000 tickets last year. Less than half of a percentage of themwere even associated with anything, uh, related to to infrastructure. And I even read some ofthem. And a lot of them were just questions about how, how Pressable goes about handling.Um, so we\u2019ve basically eliminated support for, for hosting.Cory Miller: That\u2019s the headline right there for, for WordPress hosting that, that\u2019s the headline ofthe interview today. For sure. Well, um, Jesse, we\u2019ve covered a lot, but I wanna make sure wedidn\u2019t miss anything. Um, I think it\u2019s an incredibly compelling service. Could help really raise thestandard of the hosting industry for WordPress.Um, that\u2019s exactly. So what, uh, [00:30:00] and, and this is the note I wanted to say about thehosting experiences like that, uh, I think that frees a hosting company to also innovate on thatapplication labor. What things, whether it\u2019s plugins, themes, services on top that add value forwho their customers are and what they\u2019re trying to get.And I think that\u2019s, that\u2019s pretty dang cool. If I were in that seat hosting product, uh, manager, I\u2019dbe like, okay, this is taken care of. It\u2019s base lever, le level here. Now how can we set ourselvesapart by adding value to who our customers are? But is there anything with that, um, we left at,or you wanna mention?Jesse Friedman: Well, I\u2019ll actually just pick up right there where you, uh, you mentioned about,uh, hosting companies. I think one thing to remember is, is that, Our mission at Automatic morethan anything is to provide, um, and democratize publishing. We know that, but it\u2019s, it\u2019s alsoabout making sure that WordPress is not only [00:31:00] readily available, but performing at alevel that, um, allows you to focus on getting the word out about your business or your politicalviews or whatever it might be.Um, but hosting companies, uh, are experiencing incredible churn right now. Uh, we. This waslike the number one topic at that conference I mentioned earlier. Cloud Fest, um, hostingcompanies are seeing extreme churn, and the problem is, is that when someone churns from ahosting company that is specifically for WordPress, they don\u2019t churn and go, they don\u2019t tryhosting company a.Say, oh, my WordPress experience wasn\u2019t so great there. I\u2019m gonna go try hosting company Band try WordPress there, and then I\u2019m gonna try hosting company C and try WordPress there.That\u2019s not really What happens is that they give WordPress a shot on whatever hostingcompany they\u2019ve chosen. And if that fails, uh, or that doesn\u2019t work out for them, a lot of themend up going to something else.And so that one opportunity to provide a [00:32:00] superior WordPress experience is reallywhere we want to help, right? So if we can take care of the, the infrastructure, the hosting, thesecurity, the performance, and make sure that everyone has this like level set, amazing hostingexperience in terms of the infrastructure.I wanna touch on the exact, like, I wanna reiterate what you just said, which is that that allowshosting companies to innovate on what they can do to provide better onboarding, reduce time to\nlive, which is how fast they can launch their site, helping to make sure customers aresuccessful, focus your time on marketing so that customers sites, once they\u2019re launched, theycan actually gain traffic and, and really help them to achieve their business goals.And the other thing that I just wanted to touch on real quick too is, is just, uh, we talked a little bitabout scaling, but one of the things I do wanna mention is, is that, um, so these are bare metalboxes that we built up that we own. They\u2019re, we\u2019re not outsourcing anything at all. Um, and wehave 28 data centers around the globe already that are ours, uh, powering this entireinfrastructure.[00:33:00] Um, and then, uh, when someone. Hit with traffic, an extreme amount of traffic. Whattypically happens with other, um, cloud platforms is that they replicate everything onto aseparate box and they try to throw additional boxes at the problem. But the problem is that ifyou\u2019re down, because you can\u2019t service the amount of traffic that you\u2019re handling, you have towait for that extra box to spool up, or you\u2019re paying for it to be laying in weight.Right. What we can do actually is what we do is vertical scaling. So we have the option to throwmore PHPs and more CPUs at the problem until we\u2019ve compensated for the amount of trafficthat you have. But this is where things get really unique. We go when we build out hostingplans. As I said before, hosts can build plans between two and say 30 PHP workers and CPUs.That\u2019s built for sustained traffic of 400,000 visits to 15 million visits. Um, but now let\u2019s say youhave an e-commerce website that got featured on the wire cutter, or you have, uh, a productthat you\u2019ve been [00:34:00] ready to release and you have a huge wait list, uh, and everyone\u2019sgonna slam your site at the same exact time.WP Cloud has a very unique opportunity that we can burst to 110 PhD P workers in CPUs. Andthen what we\u2019re talking about then is, is handling the type of traffic that like the Washington Postgets when they release an article about what\u2019s happening in our, in our government, or. C n ntraffic, you know what I mean?Mm-hmm. Um, and so those, those are the types of things that we\u2019re, we\u2019re mainly focused onso that we can provide, you know, v i p level hosting, um, and allow hosting companies to breakout of that shared hosting and the cheaper managed hosting, and to really offer something to,you know, to any of those customers that are, that are experiencing incredibly high.Cory Miller: I wanna go back to something you said because I absolutely, it rings true with me,is that if the hosting experience is not good, particularly on the WordPress as an applicationlayer, [00:35:00] um, yeah, we\u2019re, we\u2019re not, we\u2019re doing a disservice to the entire industrybecause we\u2019re. Turning a WordPress person into another Com competitor.And you know, I\u2019ve been in this space a long time and I go, you know, I woke up a year ago andgo, wow, there\u2019s very solid competitors to WordPress now out there. And if we want to, as thebusiness eco ecosystem of WordPress continued to have this incredible thriving grow.Ecosystem and the software. Then we, you know, we used to say like, you need two things.You need a domain name and you need WordPress hosting to Yep. To buy our products. Andthen again to those agencies out there who we serve, um, at post tennis and are building onthat, that love, that inflow and growth that we\u2019ve all enjoyed with the growth of WordPress, thenwe need to be serious about this conversation in the hosting experience because, You hit it righton the nail.They\u2019re not leaving the hosting [00:36:00] company. Just the hosting company. They\u2019re leavingpotentially WordPress. And that\u2019s the bell I want to keep ringing, is that as an industry, we needto do things like this. This is, this is a key pillar. I think. Um, there\u2019s other things that we need tobe doing as a WordPress business ecosystem to keep this healthy, thriving, growing.And, uh, I\u2019m glad you mentioned that because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve seen, um, too, but that justgives a real world experience of like, if these hosting companies are having churn, it\u2019s not justthem, it\u2019s all of us. And there, there\u2019s a brand that we\u2019ve had with WordPress that has beenawesome and I\u2019m incredibly grateful for the brand and the open source software.So I appreciate you mentioning that .Jesse Friedman: Yeah, of course. Yeah. If you remember the old days of the five minute install,um, I do. That was basically, uh, yeah. And for anyone who\u2019s listening, who, who may not befamiliar with that, cuz it\u2019s, it\u2019s been enough years now. Uh, when you used to get a, [00:37:00] a,a new hosting account, it never really came pre-built with WordPress, uh, out of the box, you\u2019dhave to.\nDownload WordPress from wordpress.org, re-upload it, sftp, build a database. Um, and then thefive minute install came out and it was like this brilliant way of like launching a WordPresswebsite super fast. And that was the moment I think that husband companies decided like, waita minute, we can actually like really create custom WordPress experiences.Because it\u2019s no longer in charge of the customer to actually launch a WordPress website. It\u2019snow up to the, the host to actually launch that instance. And that\u2019s when they started packagingtheir own plugins, their own themes into it, providing their own unique solutions. And that\u2019s allwell and good. Um, but I think there is a responsibility to those hosts, to the larger ecosystem tomake sure that we\u2019re, we\u2019re furthering the mission across the board.Um, and so their churn is definitely a reflection of the larger ecosystems. Hundred percent.Cory Miller: I mean, that affects all of our members that post us from product companies,[00:38:00] professionals that do WordPress love, being able to do pre WordPress as their careerand the agency serving their clients out. Across the world.So a hundred percent agree. And this, this is something we\u2019ll have to change the headline a littlebit and add to it because it\u2019s my personal viewpoint that we need to, all of us collectively look atthe industry and go, what makes it healthier for everybody? And this is a, this is part of theconversation, so it matters, this conversation today, even if they don\u2019t choose to go with WPCloud, that we need to be thinking about this experience for the overall health of, of the industry.Yeah. Absolut. For sure, Jesse, my friend. Um, so if somebody\u2019s interested and wants to talkmore about W Cloud, what do they do?Jesse Friedman: So if you\u2019re a hosting company and uh, you wanna partner with WP Cloud, goto wp.cloud. Uh, it\u2019ll load so fast, you think it\u2019s a local site. Uh, so that\u2019ll be your first taste of thepower of WP Cloud.Uh, funny [00:39:00] enough, that site is actually hosted by Pressable on just a regular account.Nothing special. Um, so, uh, you\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll see how that works if you\u2019re thinking. Moving yourown personal sites or your businesses sites, um, and you\u2019re not a hosting company, but youwant to, you want to try out WP Cloud, take a look at our partners.So we have, uh, wordpress.com Pressable, uh, if you\u2019re a news site, you could try News PackGrid Pain now offers, um, uh, WP Cloud as well. And, uh, and uh, yeah, we have some otherpartners coming down the pike too. Uh, that will be, uh, will be.Cory Miller: Let me know when the newpartners come in. We wanna share that, um, to, to our members at Postes.But Jesse, thanks. Sure. Uh, for this today. I appreciate your time sharing about what you\u2019redoing at WP Cloud and Automatic. Um, so thank you and everybody else. Thank you forlistening in to another post status draft episode I, the product People series.Jesse Friedman: Yeah. Well, thank you for having me. I really appreciate it.[00:40:00]\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPost Tags:\t\t\n#Accessibility#Acquisition#Africa#Agency#Altis DXP#Automattic#B2B#Black Friday#Blocks#Bluehost#Brian Gardner#CloudFlare#Cloudways#CMS#community#Content#contracts#Cory Miller#CSS#Cyber Monday#Dan Knauss#DDoS#Digital Ocean#Discussion#Diversity#Documentation#DXP#Encryption#Enterprise#Ethics#Featured Image#Figma#Forbes#Freemius#Genesis#GitHub#GoDaddy#Gutenberg#Health#Hosting#HTML#Human Made#Inclusion#Interviews#JavaScript#Jesse Friedman#JSON#Kinsta#Magento#maintenance#Marketing#Membership#Migrate#Multisite#Nathan Ingram#New York Times#Nexcess#Open Source#Outsourcing#Pandemic#Partnerships#Performance#PHP#Plugins#Pressable#Pricing#Publishing#SaaS#Scale#SEO#Shopify#Square#Standards#Static#Themes#TikTok#tutorials#UX#Webflow#WooCommerce#WordCamp#WordPress VIP#WordPress.com#WordPress.org#WP Cloud#WP Engine#Yoast \n\n\n\n\n\nPost navigation\nPrevious\nPreviousWordPress Book \u2022 Women & Nonbinary Release \u2022 WP6.3 \u2022 More Effective Contributor DaysNextContinue\nLaunching a WordPress Product in Public: Session 10\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar Posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaura Hazard Owen wrote another great\u2026\nByBrian Krogsgard \nMay 5, 2017 \n\n\n\nLaura Hazard Owen wrote another great post on Nieman Lab, this time closer to home.
