The non-profit organization was founded by Talisha Lewallen with the goals of helping job seekers better demonstrate their skills to potential employers and giving businesses a way to understand prospective employees\u2019 skills.  \n The new credential costs $150 for the exam and includes three courses towards mastering frontend development: \n\nWordPress Management and Design Credential\u00a0holders have validated their understanding of important aspects of WordPress and its websites. This credential is designed for anyone who wants to work in the WordPress space or learn to build WordPress websites. Once certified, these individuals are ready to pursue WordPress Web design, e-commerce, JavaScript, databases and other fields.\n\nMany of items under the beginner and intermediate levels of the credential essentially describe a WordPress \u201cpower user,\u201d or someone who knows their way around the platform and its more advanced features, including skills like navigating the admin panel, hosting, web optimization, and more.\nCertifyWP administers a proctored exam for the credential and those who meet the requirements will be required to re-take the exam every three years to maintain their credentialing. The exam will be updated as necessary by CertifyWP\u2019s advisory board.\nThere are 110 questions in the exam, spread over three levels, as well as a practical component. The questions must be answered within 60 minutes with 80% for a passing score. Examinees do not have to take CertifyWP\u2019s course in order to be eligible for the exam \u2013 it\u2019s open to anyone who wants to take it.\nLewallen is also the owner of WPConnects, a company that helps military veterans get training while they are on active duty and then provides them with mentors and assistance with employment when they leave the military. In a recent WP Tavern Jukebox podcast episode she discussed how this work led to her starting CertifyWP with the help of the WordPress community.\nLewallen will also be speaking at Atarim\u2019s Web Agency Summit on April 25, about the importance of credentials in the WordPress workforce, the differences between credentials and certificates, and how credentials can be leveraged in the search for employment.\nCategory: NewsShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Like thisLike Loading\u2026\n\n11\n\n\n\n\t\t11 responses to \u201cCertifyWP Launches WordPress Management and Design Credential\u201d\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Miroslav Glavi\u0107 says: \n\nApril 25, 2023 at 12:00 AM \n\n\nSo I have to pay $150 every three years to get some paper saying I am good with WordPress? Even though I\u2019ve been doing it since around 2005. I have a portfolio. Interesting.\nWhy is this \u201cpaper\u201d worth more than any other similar credential? What makes it worth more than the paper and ink on it?\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Gary says: \n\nApril 25, 2023 at 9:36 AM \n\n\nPro tip: Don\u2019t buy it if you don\u2019t need it.\nCredentials aren\u2019t a new concept. This is an option for people who are interested.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Miroslav Glavi\u0107 says: \n\nApril 25, 2023 at 10:51 AM \n\n\nPro tip: Yes I know this is not a new concept. I simply challenged why this one is \u201cbetter\u201d than others. I will do the same in the future for the others that will come.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Doug Triplett says: \n\nApril 25, 2023 at 5:50 AM \n\n\nThere has long been a need for credentialing in the industry. I\u2019ve been using WordPress since the beginning and know my stuff. My client\u2019s know. But potential clients have no clue. It is just another credibility step for WordPress users.\nI\u2019m going to take the exam purely to help the effort and I would encourage others to as well.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Miroslav Glavi\u0107 says: \n\nApril 25, 2023 at 10:49 AM \n\n\nPotential clients go to your website and look at your portfolio?\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Alex says: \n\nApril 25, 2023 at 3:43 PM \n\n\nBut unless you have a third party verify that the projects in your portfolio were actually done by you, your potential clients can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s really your portfolio. The whole point of a certification is that a third-party is involved to verify that what you\u2019re saying about yourself is true.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n James says: \n\nApril 25, 2023 at 8:14 AM \n\n\nLooking at the mobile view of their website I would struggle to have faith in their skill level. It is not balanced, the css is not good, and it contains virtually no information at all of value. I certainly would not be paying out that amount of money just to prove I can create a website as bad as that\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Matt Gowdy says: \n\nApril 25, 2023 at 11:46 AM \n\n\nIf I fix the frontend issues with their website, can I get the certification for free? Or is that the practical component?\nI kid (sort of). I\u2019m surprised though that WordPress.org or Automattic never offered this sort of thing as it would certainly carry more authority than a non-profit group.\nStill, for some developers, this would be a nice feather to add to their cap assuming clients hear about it and respect the merit involved.\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Meagan says: \n\nApril 28, 2023 at 8:34 AM \n\n\nWe\u2019re working on it!\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Grant says: \n\nApril 27, 2023 at 9:43 AM \n\n\nMy question is whether learnwp is moving toward this type of credentialing.  They are working on alot of documentation and videos, so are they planning to do the same?  If so, that cert would be more valuable\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n Meagan Hanes says: \n\nApril 28, 2023 at 8:34 AM \n\n\nThat\u2019s the dream, but we could use some more help making it a reality!\n\nLoading\u2026\n\n\n\nReply \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
