Applied to required courses in the Master of Business Administration (MBA) program.\nOptional SIRF (Student Involvement and Representation, see below) fee: $2\nStudent Involvement and Representation Fee\nBeginning fall 2015, a $2 per term optional SIRF is assessed to each student. The $2 per term contribution establishes a stable funding model for the California State Student Association (CSSA).\nThe SIRF is listed in the 'Additional Fees' section as it is an optional fee, which means that students have the option of not contributing to this fee in their tuition. If students choose to opt-out of this fee, they must opt-out no later than the census date for each term. After the census date, students will no longer be able to opt out for the semester.\nFor more information about SIRF, visit the\u00a0Associated Students.\nFor step-by-step directions to opt-out of\u00a0SIRF.\nDepartment of Defense Tuition Assistance Program\nStudents who are participating in the Department of Defense Tuition Assistance program may find additional information about tuition rates by visiting\u00a0The California State University\u00a0policy website.\nNotes to Charges and Fees\nThe CSU makes every effort to keep student costs to a minimum. Fees listed in published schedules or student accounts may need to be increased when public funding is inadequate. Therefore, CSU must reserve the right, even after fees are initially charged or initial fee payments are made, to increase or modify any listed fees. All listed fees, other than mandatory systemwide fees, are subject to change without notice, until the date when instruction for a particular semester or quarter has begun. All CSU listed fees should be regarded as estimates that are subject to change upon approval by the Board of Trustees, the Chancellor, or the Presidents, as appropriate. Changes in mandatory systemwide fees will be made in accordance with the requirements of the Working Families Student Fee Transparency and Accountability Act (Sections 66028 - 66028.6 of the Education Code).\n3.2% Campus-based Fees increase in Fall 2022\u00a0based on CPI for Greater Bay Area for 2021\u00a0calendar year. Methodology for annual adjustment approved by student referendum in April 2001.\nThe optional Student Involvement and Representation (SIRF) fee is a voluntary CSU systemwide fee adopted by the Board of Trustees for the purpose of establishing a stable funding model for the California State Student Association (CSSA). It consists of a $2 per-term fee assessed to each CSU student on a voluntary basis, allowing the choice to opt-out. The fee took effect in fall 2015. For additional info visit the\u00a0CSSA website.\nList of Factors for Future Considerations of Fee Changes per\u00a0AB 970 adopted via CSU BOT (pdf)\u00a0resolution 3/20/13.\nPer\u00a0Executive Order No.\u00a01102, beginning in fall 2010, for each adjustment made by trustee action to the State University Fee for graduate students, an equal adjustment will be made to the Graduate Professional Business Fee (formerly Professional Program Fee).\nTerm \"Tuition Fee\" used in place of \"State University Fee\" following approval at 11/10/10 CSU BOT and guidelines in CSU\u00a0Executive Order No. 1102.\nThe per term tuition fee schedules are provided at\u00a0the\u00a0Chancellor's\u00a0Office\u00a0website.\nOther Student Charges and Fees (tentative)\nList of other fees and charges\nType of Fee\nCost\nAlcohol and Other Drug Intervention: Level I\n65\nAlcohol and Other Drug Intervention: Level II\n65\nApplication Fee *\n70\nCounseling Transcript Evaluation\n25 - 50\nCredential Processing & Evaluation\n25\nCredential Processing Non-SSU Applicants\n40\nCredential Out of State Verification\n15\nCredential Subject Matter Authorization Eval\n15\nDishonored Check or Credit Card Fee (returned for any cause)\n20\nFailure to meet administratively required appointment or time limit\n20\nFEPL\n250\nHlth Ctr/Pharmacy/Lab Service\nCost\nItems lost or broken, or damage to the University property\nCost\nLate Registration\n25\nLost Keys\n25\nModern Language Lab Fee\n10\nModern Language Prof. Exam\n50\nMusical Equipment Deposit\n20\nMusical Instru./Audio/Visual Eq.\n25\nPE Lost Equipment\nCost\nPE Towel/Locker Use (optional)\n10\nStudio Arts Cleaning and Safety Equipment Fee\n10\n*This fee is payable upon application for admission or readmission by all new students or students returning after an absence of two or more semesters.\nDeposits for locker keys and breakage required in some laboratory courses.
