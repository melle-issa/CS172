Sylvie Bastardo \u201925 rose to the occasion and her views surpassed everyone\u2019s expectations.\nSince then, Prince\u2019s Influencer Marketing course at Chapman has made national headlines. The cause? Bastardo\u2019s viral TikTok.\n\u201cThe first class began with a short slideshow, where he mentioned we would be doing a TikTok challenge,\u201d she said. Bastardo made her video that same day.\nBastardo\u2019s famous six-second clip briefly shows viewers the slide from class explaining the challenge, followed by a friend\u2019s reaction. \u201cI took a video of my friend and the screen, then I chose audio that was trending on my For You page. The sound was random, but it was getting attention.\u201d The For You Page is the first page that TikTokers land on when they open the app. It uses an algorithm to suggest content based on the user\u2019s history and what\u2019s trending.\n\u00a0\n\n@sylvieclaire My professor said if our class got a tiktok to 1 million likes he would cancel the final!! Please like!!! #communicationsclass #influencermarketing #finalexam #college \u266c WHY ARE PPL USING THIS SOUND \u2013 John Phillips\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe audio worked in her favor, and the video gained more than one million views in less than 48 hours. \u201cThe build up was really crazy,\u201d Bastardo said. \u201cI was watching it grow and I thought, \u2018oh my God, I might actually do this.\u2019\u201d Currently, Bastardo\u2019s viral TikTok has five million views and counting.\nPrince stitched the viral TikTok (a tool that allows users to combine another TikTok with their own) where he gave her props for completing the challenge. However, Prince did not plan for the challenge to unfold so quickly. \u201cI was totally and pleasantly surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hoping it would evolve over the course of the semester and that we could work on things together that would help support the creation of content. I thought it would progress as the students learn how to eventually grow their content.\u201d\n\n@itsmattprince #stitch with @sylvieclaire guess i dont have to grade a final now. AND I made my point. Win win if you really think about it #influencermarketing #professorsoftiktok #chapmanuniversity #professortok #collegelife #college \u266c original sound \u2013 Matt Prince\n\n\n\u00a0\nAs a result of the media attention on her viral video, Bastardo gained a whopping 8,000 followers, which prompted her to continue making videos. \u201cI\u2019ve been posting more \u2018day in my life\u2019 content. I don\u2019t have any set plans for a social media career, but I like making videos.\u201d\nWith trending guest speakers, interactive lessons and the occasional free Taco Bell lunch, Prince\u2019s class left a big impact on Bastardo. \u201cI\u2019m considering switching my major from business to communications because I love this class; it\u2019s been great!\u201d She exclaimed.\nAs successful as Bastardo\u2019s TikTok is, Prince doesn\u2019t want it to take away from the lesson behind the challenge. \u201cOne of the reasons for this challenge was to show the democratization of social media,\u201d he began. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a celebrity anymore to drive big, viral moments.\u201d Prince plans to try this challenge again in the future, with some changes to hit educational points along the way.\u00a0\nPrince\u2019s course consists of lessons regarding branding and how to utilize social media to build brand personality and awareness \u2013 specifically through influencers whose content and online persona reflects the brand you\u2019re building. Guest speakers play a key role in sharing their viral experiences, showing the class that anyone can do it with the right knowledge of how the algorithm works.\nMatt Prince photographed by Ben Pier of the NY Times.\nPrince foresees colleges continuing to add social media courses into their curriculum. \u201cI think it\u2019s certainly in the best interest of universities if they want to continue to grow these areas of study,\u201d he said. \u201cThe amount of careers and opportunities these lessons will shape are pretty large. We can\u2019t rely on a curriculum that was built from 5 to 10 years ago, as technology is constantly evolving. We need to evolve with it, follow the pace of culture, and I think students will respond favorably to that.\u201d\u00a0\nThe old ways of online advertising are becoming stagnant in results. Prince believes that it\u2019s due to younger millennials and Gen Z relying on social media such as TikTok for news and honest brand reviews. \u201cThe consumer is really smart and knows when something is being advertised to them. Gen Z specifically doesn\u2019t want to be advertised to.\u201d Prince went on to note that younger generations want to make decisions for themselves \u201cthat are reflective of who they are and the communities they associate themselves with.\u201d \nHe drives this point home by adding, \u201cYou don\u2019t get that through brands necessarily; you get that through people in those communities\u2013 influencers and creators.\u201d As technology continues to grow with the awareness of consumers, Prince doesn\u2019t see influencers going away anytime soon.\n\n\nBachelor of Arts in Strategic and Corporate Communication business Chapman University in the news communication influencer marketing modern marketing Strategic Marketing and Communications \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJennifer Winfield \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapman Giving Day 2023 Sets Goal of 1,000 Donations\n\n\n\n\n\nSandi Simon Center for Dance Ushers in New Era for Dance at Chapman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership That Spans the Campus Jack of all trades Kyle Tanimura is leaving quite the lasting mark on Chapman, where he has taken on multiple leadership roles as a double major in political science and strategic and corporate communication, with a...\n\n\nMay 1, 2023 Jennifer Winfield\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Pacific Islander Desi American Heritage Month Events at Chapman University Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Heritage Month, which runs from May 1 to 31, celebrates the identities, histories and experiences of the APIDA community.
