 Privacy Policy\n\n\n\nSection 1: Privacy Policy\u00a0\nPOLICY STATEMENT\nThis policy describes Chapman University's data protection strategy to comply with multiple regulations, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\"EU GDPR\").\nREASON FOR THE POLICY\nIn order for Chapman to educate its international and domestic students, engage in world-class research, and provide community services, it is essential and necessary, and Chapman has a lawful basis, to collect, process, use, and/or maintain the personal data of its students, employees, applicants, research subjects, and others involved in its educational, research, and community programs. \u00a0These activities include, without limitation, admission, registration, delivery of classroom and study abroad education, grades, communications, employment, applied research, development, program analysis for improvements, and records retention.\nThe EU GDPR imposes obligations on entities, like Chapman, that collect or process personal data about people in the European Union (\"EU\"). \u00a0The EU GDPR applies to personal data collected or processed about anyone located in the EU, regardless of whether they are a citizen or permanent resident of an EU country.\nPOLICY\nLawful Basis for Collecting or Processing Personal Data\nChapman has a lawful basis to collect and process personal data. \u00a0Most of Chapman's collection and processing of personal data will fall under the following categories:\n\nProcessing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Chapman or by a third party.\nProcessing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.\nProcessing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which Chapman is subject.\nThe data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes.\n\nThere will be some instances where the collection and processing of personal data will be pursuant to other lawful bases.\nData Protection & Governance\nChapman protects all personal data and sensitive personal data that it collects or processes for a lawful basis. Any personal data and sensitive personal data collected or processed by Chapman is:\n\nProcessed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner\nCollected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes, and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes\nLimited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and processed\nAccurate and kept up to date\nRetained only as long as necessary\nSecure\n\nSensitive Personal Data & Consent\nChapman obtains consent before it collects or processes sensitive personal data.\nIndividual Rights\nIndividual data subjects covered by this policy will be afforded the following rights:\n\ninformation about the controller collecting the data\nthe data protection officer contact information (if assigned)\nthe purposes and lawful basis of the data collection/processing\nrecipients of the personal data\nif Chapman intends to transfer personal data to another country or international organization\nthe period the personal data will be stored\nthe existence of the right to access, rectify incorrect data or erase personal data, restrict or object to processing, and the right to data portability\nthe existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time\nthe right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (established in the EU)\nwhy the personal data are required, and possible consequences of the failure to provide the data\nthe existence of automated decision-making, including profiling\nif the collected data are going to be further processed for a purpose other than that for which it was collected\n\nSection 2: Chapman Privacy Practices\nChapman University Use of Personal Information\nChapman University recognizes the importance of protecting the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of personal information.

See TouchNet's privacy policy.\nWhat Other Exceptions Are There?\nChapman University reserves the right to use personal information in its database to identify the source of any inappropriate use of information resources managed by the association, including but not limited to: offensive or illegal postings to online discussion lists, collaboration sites, and other communication vehicles; denial of service actions; unauthorized use of online services and network infrastructure; misuse or unauthorized use of the Chapman University name, logo, or other representations of the association; and to protect the personal safety and privacy of our members, online users, and the public under the policies and practices described above.\nThis is the privacy policy for the Common App which we use for undergraduate students to apply to Chapman: https://www.commonapp.org/privacy-policy \nThis is the privacy policy on PCTAS which we use for students to apply to Chapman\u2019s Physical Therapy doctorate program: http://www.ptcas.org/PrivacyPolicy/\nThis is the legal notice LSAC which we use for students applying to Chapman\u2019s Law School: http://www.lsac.org/aboutlsac/policies/privacy-policy\nThis is the privacy policy for Star Rez which we use for Residence Life\u2019s Housing Request system: https://www.starrez.com/legal/privacy\nThis is the privacy policy for OrgSync which we use for Student & Campus Life's clubs and organizations: http://www.orgsync.com/legal/privacy\nThis is the privacy center for PowerSchool which we use for new student inquiries, campus visits and VIP pages for prospective students: https://www.powerschool.com/privacy-statement-overview/\nStudent Email Accounts\nOffice 365 and Gmail are the official student email accounts for all University email communications with its students. For student email services, the University has contracted with Microsoft as the provider of Office 365 and Google as the provider of Gmail (collectively \u201cthe Providers\u201d).\nUnder the Providers\u2019 terms of service, the University may respond to a third party\u2019s request for student email records. A \u201cThird Party Request\" means a request from a third party for records related to a student\u2019s Gmail or Office 365 account or other student related Provider service records. Third Party Requests include, but may not be limited to, a search warrant, court order, subpoena, litigation discovery or legal preservation hold request, other valid legal order, or a written consent from the student permitting disclosure. If the University receives a Third Party Request, it may interface with Microsoft or Google to obtain or preserve the requested records or direct the requestor to contact the Provider or the student directly.\nSimilarly, the University may also preserve a student\u2019s Office 365 or Gmail records and other student related Provider service records by way of the Provider\u2019s interface when the University receives notice of a disciplinary or other matter involving the student, a claim, potential litigation or other legal duty to preserve the records.\nWhile students may use University provided Office 365 and Gmail accounts for personal communications, students are reminded that the primary purpose of the accounts are for University related communications.\nIs my Student email account secure and private?\nAs stated above, Office 365 and Gmail are the official student email accounts for all University email communications with its students.\nThe University provides Office 365 and Gmail to students to support the educational, research, and public service missions of the University. The Chapman University Computer and Network Acceptable Use Policy applies to these Microsoft and Google online education services. In addition, all Microsoft and Google apps usage are governed by their own terms of service that all Chapman users are required to abide by.\nStudent email and account data may include personally identifiable information from the student\u2019s education records that are subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\"). To the extent that student data includes FERPA records, Microsoft and Google acting as the Providers will each be considered a \"School Official\" (as that term is used in FERPA and its implementing regulations) and will comply with FERPA.\nBoth Microsoft and Google provide additional settings and tools within the account that let you protect your data and privacy.\nRead more about the security and privacy for Microsoft and Google at:\nGoogle Policies: https://www.google.com/policies/  Microsoft Policies: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/Security/Office365Security\nWhat should I do if I have questions?\nIf you have questions about our privacy policy, please contact servicedesk@chapman.edu.\nConsent\nBy using this site, you signify your consent to Chapman University's on-line privacy policy.
