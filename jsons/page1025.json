Brown signed Senate Bill 43 establishing the college as a member of the California State College system. The college opened in temporary quarters in 1961 under the leadership of founding president Ambrose R. Nichols, Jr. with an enrollment of 265 upper-division students. Most of the faculty and administrators of the Santa Rosa Center of San Francisco State College, which had served the region since 1956, joined the new college. Sonoma State College moved to its present 269-acre site in 1966 when its first two buildings, Stevenson and Darwin Halls, were completed. By then there were more than 1,000 students enrolled. In 1978, University status was granted and the name of the college was changed to Sonoma State University.\nUniversity Milestones\nYear\nEvent\n1961\nSSU Becomes part of the California State College system (now the California State University)\n1962\nFirst bachelor of arts degree (elementary education)\n1962\nFirst four-year program offered\nMay 1966\nFirst graduating class\n1966\nFirst master's degree offered (biology, psychology)\n1978\nUniversity status attained\n1999\nSSU invited to join the Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges as sole member from California\n2000\nThe Jean & Charles Schulz Information Center is built\n2001\nThe Lifelong Learning Institute for students over the age of 50 is founded.
