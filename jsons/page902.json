For these families\u2014and more than 177,000 alumni\u2014Chico State is not just a university or campus. It is the branches of the family tree. This is\u00a0one of six profiles\u00a0of families who are rooted in their Wildcat connection.\nSalvador and Maria Hernandez arrived in Chico from their small town in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, nearly 30 years ago. Salvador uprooted his family hoping his children would flourish in the United States.\nThe young family settled close enough to campus that the Trinity Hall carillon still serenades them every day. Early on, Salvador, a stable hand, instilled in his children the importance of going to school and encouraged them to pursue a degree. \n\u201cThe only reason he came to this country was so his children could get a good education,\u201d Maria said. \u201cHe wanted them to be studious, to get their degrees, and to obtain a career, so they wouldn\u2019t have to be like him and work all the time\u2014in the rain and the heat.\u201d\nIn May, Salvador\u2019s wish will be fulfilled when his youngest son, history major Eriberto Hernandez-Campos, graduates from Chico State. He will be the fifth sibling to do so.\nForty-two-year-old Salvador died in 2005 of complications of autoimmune neuropathy and did not see any of his children graduate. Yet, he was always confident\u2014maybe even more than they were\u2014that they would achieve the dream he created for them since he couldn\u2019t experience it himself.\n\u201cIn Mexico, there wasn\u2019t an opportunity for him\u2014that\u2019s why he wanted his kids to finish school,\u201d Maria said. \u201cHe would be so proud to see how all his children are moving forward and advancing in life. For me, it\u2019s also an honor that they all have attended a university. I am very proud of them.\u201d\n\nSalvador and Maria Hernandez\nTheir eldest and only daughter, Elia, earned her BA in business administration in 2005. Salvador got his BS in computer engineering in 2009 and an MS in electrical and computer engineering in 2014; Marco graduated in 2013 with a BA in business administration; and Guadalupe earned his BS in mathematics in 2019 and an MS in data science from Stanford University in 2022.\n\u201cMy father was a man who dedicated himself fully to whatever challenge or task was placed on him,\u201d said Guadalupe, an operations research analyst for the United States Air Force. \u201cIf he lacked the necessary skills or knowledge, he went out of his way to acquire those skills and get the job done. He never made any excuses.\u201d\nInfluencing his children through his actions, Salvador would routinely take classes at Butte College to become qualified on various farm equipment, like tree shakers for almond trees.\n\u201cHe wanted to be the best at everything he attempted,\u201d Guadalupe said. \u201cHis relentlessness in the pursuit of excellence was awe-inspiring.\u201d\nSalvador began working at a very young age and was only able to attend elementary school. Still, Elia said her father was a brilliant man with a knack for numbers and mathematics. He also had the most beautiful handwriting, which is something not often seen in men, said Elia, who is a fiscal analyst for Glenn County.\nAs the oldest sibling, it was important for Elia to pursue a degree to set an example for her brothers to follow.\n\nMaria Hernandez and her youngest of five children, Eriberto.\n\u201cI feel completely satisfied and proud knowing all of my siblings have graduated from college,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that if my father was here, he would feel the same way.\u201d\nEriberto\u2014the youngest sibling\u2014chose Chico State for its academic excellence, as well as to be close to home and to follow in his siblings\u2019 footsteps.\n\u201cMany little kids are not usually thinking about college or what they will do with their lives, but I grew up watching my sister start her career\u2014I was 3 years old saying I wanted to be an accountant,\u201d Eriberto said.\nGuadalupe said knowing that all his siblings have graduated from Chico State fills him with pride. He called it a significant achievement that represents the culmination of decades of hard work, determination, and perseverance not just for him, but for the entire family.\n\u201cIt speaks volumes about the caliber of people I was fortunate enough to call my family,\u201d he said.\nAs graduation day nears, Eriberto\u2019s been thinking a lot about his family, his dad, and how his parents will have five college graduates.\n\u201cIt makes me a bit emotional because I\u2019m the last one,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m closing this chapter for our family. But it also makes me feel proud of my family and my siblings\u2014some pursued master\u2019s degrees and all have found successful careers.\n\u201cAfter all the sacrifices and obstacles my family faced along the way, we still met our goals,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to face anything.\u201d\n\n\nShare this Article\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tAlmendra Lawrence\t\t\n\n\n\t\tAlmendra (Journalism, '11) is a bilingual content producer that helps empower and inspire audiences through storytelling.
