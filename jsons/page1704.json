Through both\u00a0academic and housing accommodations, we work to mitigate physical and attitudinal barriers that students might face. We are dedicated to supporting students with disabilities to give them the opportunity to perform at their highest academic potential. We also strive to promote the inclusive environment they need to experience full membership in our diverse Stanford community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Office is Open Mondays - Fridays: 9am - 12pm & 1pm - 4pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a disability?\nDisability occurs on a spectrum. An individual with a disability is defined as someone with a physical or mental impairment which impacts that person\u2019s major life activities. There isn\u2019t an exhaustive list of disabilities; if you are experiencing limitations because of an impairment, you should get in touch with our office. Sometimes disability-related accommodations are simple -- a power door, for example. Sometimes the accommodation(s) can be complex; our job is to work with you so that together we maximize your access.\nDisabilities can be visible when someone uses a wheelchair, hearing aids, or cane. The majority of disabilities are invisible and include broad categories of learning disabilities, psychological, and chronic illnesses. Whether your disabilities are visible or invisible, temporary or chronic, the OAE wants to assist each individual find accommodations which work for them in a completely individualized process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n \nRegister here:\u00a0OAE | CONNECT\u00a0\nProspective Students FAQ\nDocumentation Guidelines\nStudent Opportunities with OAE\nStanford Disability\u00a0Initiative\nEmergency Preparedness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nStanford University has a strong commitment to maintaining a diverse and stimulating academic community, representing a broad spectrum of talents and experiences.
