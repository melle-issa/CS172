Vaccination requirements will remain in place for students and staff who work or rotate in Stanford health care facilities, in accordance with\u00a0federal\u00a0guidance.\nPlease keep in mind that vaccinations and boosters remain safe, effective tools. They significantly minimize the chances of serious illness, hospitalization, and death related to COVID.\nAs a reminder, the Color testing program for students will end June 18, at the end of spring quarter, and\u00a0free rapid tests\u00a0remain available for students and employees. Faculty, staff, and postdocs should continue reporting positive test results on\u00a0Health Check, and students should do so on the\u00a0Vaden patient portal.\nStanford will continue to monitor conditions on campus and in our region, revising protocols as appropriate.\nThroughout the pandemic, you have taken campus health protocols seriously and taken steps to protect loved ones and vulnerable members of our community. We encourage you to continue making healthy choices.\nIn good health,\nJames Jacobs, MDExecutive DirectorVaden Health ServicesChair, Stanford University Public Health Steering Committee\u00a0Rich Wittman, MD, MPHMedical DirectorStanford University Occupational Health Center\n\n\nPrevious postChanges to COVID\u00a0testing program\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanford\n\n \nCOVID-19\nHealth Alerts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampus Health Resources\n\nSchool of Medicine COVID-19 Updates\nStudent Affairs Guidance for Students\nVaden Health Center (for students)\nSU Occupational Health Center (for employees)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther COVID-19 resources\n\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nU.S. Food & Drug Administration\nSanta Clara County Public Health\nSan Mateo County Health\nWorld Health Organization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\nFor questions related to Stanford's response to COVID-19 or other health concerns, please fill out this EH&S Health Guidance form.\nFor feedback about this website, please email digital-strategy@stanford.edu.\n\n\n\nConnect with us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanfordUniversity\n\n\n\n\nStanford Home(link is external)\n\nMaps & Directions(link is external)\n\nSearch Stanford(link is external)\n\nEmergency Info(link is external)\n\n\n\nTerms of Use(link is external)\n\nPrivacy(link is external)\n\nCopyright(link is external)\n\nTrademarks(link is external)\n\nNon-Discrimination(link is external)\n\nAccessibility(link is external)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Stanford University.\n\u00a0 Stanford, California 94305.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
