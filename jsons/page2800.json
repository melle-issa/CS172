The assistant professor in San Diego State University\u2019s Department of Educational Leadership is an expert in the safety and inclusion of LGBTQIA+ youth in K-12 schools, so when he looks at\u00a0a recent study\u00a0indicating 50% of LGBTQIA+ youth between the ages of 13-17 have seriously considered attempting suicide, he sees a clear canary in a coal mine.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cSince 2019, the percentages have increased each year, with rates even higher for trans and non-binary youth and many LGBTQIA+ youth of color,\u201d he said. \u201cThese trends should be concerning for anyone who cares deeply about children and youth. Lives are at stake.\u201d\u00a0Pompei is taking action as part of a\u00a0California Department of Education committee\u00a0focused on addressing the crisis through a new LGBTQIA+ cultural competency training course for California educators. He is the only representative of higher education participating on the committee, which comes with a $10,000 grant.\u00a0The committee is the result of Assembly Bill 493, which passed in 2019 and was authored by then-Assemblymember\u00a0Todd Gloria,\u00a0elected mayor of San Diego the following year. Gloria had invited Pompei \u2014 then National Director of the Youth Well-Being Program for the Human Rights Campaign \u2014 to Sacramento to testify in support of the bill.\u00a0\u00a0Now with funding secured, Pompei and his committee colleagues are working to create a course of six online learning modules educators can use to expand their understanding of LGBTQIA+ identities and learn how they can foster affirming environments in their schools.\u00a0\u201cThere's actually not a lot of extra stuff that teachers have to do,\u201d Pompei said. \u201cThis is about learning different approaches for how to address certain standards, how to communicate with students and how to make sure they're addressing biases throughout the school year. If teachers can build positive relationships and positive self-esteem, school climate and student mental health outcomes will improve.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Crisis moment\u00a0For many LGBTQIA+ young people, the past few years have been particularly trying. State legislatures nationwide have passed a spate of legislation to restrict discussion of LGBTQIA+ matters in schools.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a scary time period,\u201d Pompei said. \u201cWhat we're seeing is rhetoric that's regurgitated from many decades ago \u2014 words like \u2018eradication,\u2019 words like \u2018grooming,\u2019 accusations of sexualizing children and calling LGBTQIA+ people pedophiles. All of this results in more bullying, more harassment and more mental health challenges, including suicide.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, LGBTQIA+ youth become less likely to go to adults on campus when they need support.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt's having devastating impacts,\u201d he said. \"Well-established research indicates we should be creating safe, welcoming, and affirming learning environments for LGBTQIA+ students, not creating obstacles to their ability to learn and thrive.\"\u00a0Affirming Classrooms\u00a0The new module aims to create LGBTQIA+ Affirming Classrooms by educating teachers and other staff on several key points. The content will clarify what sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression (SOGIE) mean and what the law, education code and professional standards require. California educators, Pompei said, are often surprised to learn that there are numerous state laws and policies protecting LGBTQIA+ students in California public schools.\u00a0\u201cDecades of misinformation and bias have left many to believe that the terms LGBTQ+ and SOGIE mean something sexually explicit, and are therefore inappropriate topics for schools,\u201d Pompei said. \u201cWe need to help educators, parents and caregivers understand what these terms mean, what they don\u2019t mean and begin to dispel the myths and misconceptions.\u201d\u00a0The training curricula will also provide information on actions that research has shown to improve school safety for LGBTQIA+ students, particularly those who are multiply minoritized. That includes using gender-inclusive language (think \u201cGood morning, students\u201d instead of \u201cGood morning, boys and girls\u201d), integrating diverse voices and perspectives into lesson plans to break down negative biases and supporting student Genders and Sexuality Alliance (GSA) clubs.\u00a0\u00a0Pompei hopes to work with College of Education colleagues to see how the modules can be integrated into teacher, school counselor and educational leadership education programs at SDSU.\u00a0\u201cI'm interested in how we can begin to work together across departments and share best practices so that we're intentionally scaffolding SOGIE content throughout all of our programs,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\nLatest Stories\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSDSU Faculty Address Pandemic\u2019s Lasting Impact on Young Children and SchoolsCredential Student Strives To Be The Teacher She Once NeededEmbracing \u2018Fivey-One\u2019: NSF CAREER Award Explores How Kids Learn MathShirley Nash Weber Returns to SDSU With a Call to ActionOnline Education Master\u2019s Program Ranks 7th Best in the NationTwo SDSU Professors Ranked Nationally Among Most Influential Education ScholarsOpen Arms and Fertile Minds: A Day in a Tijuana ClassroomSDSU Researchers Inform New Law Protecting Foster Youth in Exclusionary DisciplineSDSU Team\u2019s \u2018Soul Work\u2019 Aims to Address Pandemic\u2019s Impact on Foster YouthNSF Funds New Science Teacher PipelineJuanita Nu\u00f1ez's Journey From Migrant Student to Star EducatorSDSU Selected to Transform Early Childhood Education in Nation of Georgia\n\n\nBROWSE ALL RELATED\n\n\n\n\nSeeman, Sato Named to All Mountain West TeamsSDSU Deepens Ties to OaxacaSDSU Wins Second Straight MW ChampionshipFour Aztecs Earn All-Mountain West HonorsSDSU's Class of 2023: Best Spots on Campus to Take Grad PhotosSDSU Imperial Valley Partnership Opens Doors to Higher Education for Foster YouthEducation Programs, Health Care Management Shine in New Graduate RankingsWater Polo: Legaspi and Valdes Earn GCC Postseason HonorsAztec Baseball Collects Two MW Weekly HonorsEmployee Resource Group Sets Sights on a Broader ReachThe Road to SDSU\u2019s Senior Design Day 2023More than Learning to Walk Backward\n\n\nBROWSE ALL LATEST\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossing the Line\n\n\n                                                                \n                                                                Ongoing through Thursday, May 4, 2023, 4pm The San Diego State University School of Art and Design presents Crossing the Line at the University Art Gallery through Thursday, May 4, 2023.Crossing the Line features the artwork of 29 local artists, faculty, and alumni of the School of Art and Design, whose work examines the notion of boundaries and borders.
