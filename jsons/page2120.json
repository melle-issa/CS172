Science fiction, fantasy, romance\u2014most people can call to mind a handful of genres that they consider their reading tastes. But literature is a broad, broad sphere. How many favorites are out there that you\u2019ve never even considered picking up because they don\u2019t fall into the band of genres you call your own?\nAs a student editor for Watershed Review for two semesters and Flume Press for one semester, I\u2019ve read dozens and dozens of pieces that never would have crossed my path as a casual reader. College students are often bombarded by this kind of assigned reading when they take literature courses, but personally, very few of those pieces have spoken to me in the same way that submissions to Watershed Review and Flume Press have. In part, knowing that this is the work of a living, contemporary author makes the forced reading more palatable. Someone out there put their heart into this work and cares about my eyes on it, and this leaves me more open to broadening my horizons; not only that, but I want to engage with it as the author intended, which can be difficult with unfamiliar forms. When discussing poetry chapbooks, it led me to ask a simple yet hard to answer question: \u201cHow do I read poetry?\u201d Going around the room, almost everyone had something unique to contribute. Ask what the poem is trying to achieve, how it makes you feel, and how it changes when read aloud. See how the structure of the poem on the page connects to the meaning of the poem (or doesn\u2019t). Jeanne Clark, professor of poetry at CSU Chico, provided another important piece of the puzzle for me when she visited the class and explained how she evaluates poems by the first line, last line, and the beginning and end of each line. Each of these tools, and the experience of having to read so much poetry, allowed me to appreciate the artistry involved in a form I previously cared little for.\nNonfiction was another genre that never interested me prior to working on Watershed Review. Since I was old enough to read, I have devoured science fiction, fantasy, and many other forms of fiction. My own writing has been almost exclusively fiction; I find it extremely difficult to write creatively about my own life. However, I found that the creative nonfiction writing I read often resonated strongly with me, even when my personal experiences came nowhere close to that of the piece. Specifically, the main thing I have discovered enjoyment in is nonfiction that feels intimate and unfiltered. Writing is unique among media forms in its ability to transmit emotion and thoughts with explicit precision. A conversationally-told story may be interesting and engaging, but a writer can take the time to decipher all the implicit parts of that story and portray the internal, personal lives of people in fascinating ways, all the more fascinating for being based on truth.\nAs a writer myself, all the submissions I have read have helped me reevaluate the way I write and consider my own work. Reading broadly in all genres has given me a better understanding of deftness of word and phrase; the same techniques that make a poem striking in its concise beauty can be applied to prose as well. If a scene doesn\u2019t have the impact I am looking for, the culprit is often a lack of those intimate thoughts that make you understand and care about the individuals portrayed.\u00a0\nThese insights I gained through this experience will continue to improve me as a writer, reader and editor, as well as provide a more thoughtful answer to the question:\n\u201cWhat do you enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n \n\nMay 24, 2022watershedcsuc\n\n\n\n\nWR Intern Spotlight: Confessions of an English Major, or Four Years of English Classes in 750\u00a0Words \n\nBy Isabel Henson\nMay we never again write a five paragraph essay.\nDo you remember it? The one we were taught in high school: Introduction, three concrete paragraphs, then conclusion? Some might have even shown it as a hamburger with each bun, lettuce, cheese, and patty paralleling a specific paragraph. Well, it sucks.\u00a0\nDon\u2019t misunderstand me. I think it has its time and place between learning how to write and well\u2026only during learning how to write, but anything past that holds no substance. No real weight. To stay placidly within that structure creates a kind of self bondage that doesn\u2019t translate into the real world. It taught us how to organize thoughts: but only in one specific way. There are a myriad of ways.\nGive praise where it is due.\nI do concede that if it hadn\u2019t been for that five paragraph essay, however, I don\u2019t know if I would have ever ran far away from it, to the opposite point of the spectrum and found my passion.\nUnpopular opinion: anyone who hates poetry is wrong.\nPoetry can be the opposite of the previously mentioned rigid structure. Run ons that just keep on going and going and going taught me that they are not the hearsay that I was taught and instead they have purpose and create an urgency that can only be matched or stopped by the use of fragments. Beautiful little sentences. Two words. Sometimes. Only. One. These weave focus and pointed meaning. Let us come up for a swallow of air. Everything I was taught never to use are the breaths that contribute to the lungs of the poem.\u00a0\nIt only takes one.\u00a0\nI always claimed I was a poet. Turned my nose up to any prose partially because I thought poetry was superior, but mostly because I had a disastrous writing experience at my community college that solidified my belief that I could never write fiction. Pair that with back to back heartbreaks and nothing can remedy the soul like a poem. And all was going fine until my last semester of undergrad where I stumbled upon a new medium to color my world.\nYou must know the rules to break the rules\nBut this also means pushing past one\u2019s own creative comfort zone: willingly\u2026or sometimes unwillingly. Writing does not live within a set of lexical walls and boundaries. It does not reside within a prescriptive fortress. It is formed from experience, from hopes and dreams, from fears and nightmares.\u00a0\nNow break the rules:\nMy very first class at Chico State was Literary Genres. I walked in ready to listen to the usual poetry/prose, nonfiction/fiction ideas and was instead confronted with the idea and possibility that literature is all around us. In the signs we read, in the syllabus we idly toss, in the posters held at BLM or Roe v. Wade protests. It was not confined to the historically straight male white cannon but moved fluidly in social media and also in the lyrics of J Cole.\u00a0\nTime and time again I encountered this stretch of norms and steered to uphold writing to the honor it deserves. Not by rules. By content, by ferocity, by impact.\nSo I consumed it all and took as many poetry classes as I could to move into the space I had been taught until\nI was forced to take a nonfiction class.\nAnd the only reason I took it was because my advisor \u201cencouraged\u201d me (basically told me) I should not take any more poetry classes. Maybe branch out a bit. Become a little more well rounded. Appalled and annoyed, I agreed and landed myself in a nonfiction creative writing class. Once again I assumed that I would hear the poetry/prose, nonfiction/fiction talk. Turned out to be one of my favorite classes at Chico State.\nIs it cheating if I still love both?\nMy creative nonfiction professor told me one day that I don\u2019t know where I had been hiding, or what this \u201cI\u2019m not a prose writer\u201d nonsense I had been claiming, but that I had to recognize that I was one. But the best writers of the field are those that read everything and try their hand, even for fun at a different genre. The five paragraph essay, though dull and terrible, gave me one set of tricks. Poetry handed me many more. Research papers, term papers about Shakespeare or projects on Walt Whitman, and reading Claudia Rankine\u2019s Citizen or Mai Der Vang\u2019s Afterland gave me more. How beautifully coincidental that the last class I take here mirrors the one that began my career. That I would work for the same Watershed Review that was handed to me during my introduction to this university. If there is anything we English majors take away, it is that we are taught to admire the complex ending. It does not come neatly tied with string but rather is up to interpretation and is full of twists, leaving it up to interpretation if it is the end or the beginning..\u00a0\nEven a graduate still loves a cheesy happy ending.\u00a0\n\n\n \n\nMay 24, 2022watershedcsuc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll\n\nDiscuss\nGet Inspired\nGet Polling\nGet Support\nLearn WordPress.com\nTheme Showcase\nWordPress Planet\nWordPress.com News\n\n\nTopics\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nUpcoming Events No upcoming events\nArchives\n\nMay 2022\nMarch 2022\nMay 2020\nOctober 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nOctober 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nApril 2017\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nDecember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nApril 2014\nFebruary 2014\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nAugust 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\n\n \n\nFollow me on TwitterMy Tweets \n\n\n\n\nCreate a free website or blog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
