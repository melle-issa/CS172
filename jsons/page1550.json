Struppa gives the 2023 State of the University address at Musco Center for the Arts Feb. 10.\n\n\n\n\nUniversity News \nStruppa Looks Back at Past Successes, Illuminates \u2018Our Path to Greatness\u2019 in State of the University Address\n Joy JuedesFebruary 10, 20233 min read\n\n\nIn his first in-person State of the University address since 2020, Chapman University President Daniele C. Struppa unveiled the university\u2019s new strategic plan.\n\n\u201cI remember very well being here, giving my State of the University address, pretending to have a big audience in front of me. There were only three people,\u201d Struppa said, drawing laughs at the address at Musco Center for the Arts Feb. 10.\n\u201cNow this is the real thing. So thank you so much, I really appreciate you taking the time. This is a great day for the university.\u201d\nThe strategic new plan, \u201cOur Path to Greatness,\u201d kicks off in the 2022-23 academic year and will culminate in 2028. Before Struppa detailed the new plan, he introduced a video celebrating Chapman\u2019s growth during the previous strategic plan, \u201cEngineering our Future.\u201d\nAmong the high points of the past five years: increasing endowment, assets and faculty chairs; rising in national rankings; becoming an R2-research class institution; establishing Fowler School of Engineering; producing Chapman\u2019s first Rhodes Scholar; and diversifying the student profile.\nThose and other achievements of the previous strategic plan period are the culmination of a decision 15 years ago to bring Chapman to the next level by focusing on research, Struppa said.\n\u201cWhat we have done demonstrates that we took the right direction, and we can continue that way. And when I say continue that way I think it\u2019s obvious at this point to say hey, things are going so well. Let\u2019s relax for a moment. But let\u2019s say no \u2013 this is the moment that we make the next jump,\u201d he said.\nThe next jump \u2013 \u201cOur Path to Greatness\u201d \u2013 has five strategic priorities:\n\nAcademic excellence, which includes pursuing Hispanic Serving Institution designation.\nExpanding graduate health science programs, which includes expanding Rinker Health Science Campus in Irvine.\nOrganizational excellence.\nCampus projects enhancing community-building, which includes opening a Student Success Center and adding facilities to support research growth.\nFinish a $500 million comprehensive giving campaign focused on increasing the endowment, with the goal of $2 billion by 2037. More than $300 million was already raised during the campaign\u2019s silent phase in the past five years.\n\nStruppa concluded with the reminder that \u201cthe job of inspiring belongs to all of us \u2013 to faculty, to staff, to administrators, to our trustees, our friends in the community \u2013 and I think that\u2019s what brings us together and inspires us to create a better university.\u201d\nStruppa also thanked top employers of Chapman graduates for \u201cthinking Chapman first.\u201d\n\n\nendowment State of the University strategic plan Top Employers \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJoy Juedes \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurtain Down on Chapman Celebrates, Curtain Up on $500 Million Campaign\n\n\n\n\n\nFive Chapman Faculty and Staff Members Make OC\u2019s List of 125 Most Influential People\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership That Spans the Campus Jack of all trades Kyle Tanimura is leaving quite the lasting mark on Chapman, where he has taken on multiple leadership roles as a double major in political science and strategic and corporate communication, with a...\n\n\nMay 1, 2023 Jennifer Winfield\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Pacific Islander Desi American Heritage Month Events at Chapman University Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Heritage Month, which runs from May 1 to 31, celebrates the identities, histories and experiences of the APIDA community.
