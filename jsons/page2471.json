In addition, all of the programs combine academics and community briefings with a cultural component that allows participants to better understand the diversity of populations and lifestyles in the United States.Desirable LocationOur university is located in the city of Chico, a mid-sized community in beautiful northern California. Chico offers program participants a safe and comfortable place to study, a warm and welcoming local population, the natural beauty of the California central valley and nearby mountains, and access to the urban destinations of Sacramento and San Francisco. Beautiful city parks, farmers' markets, community concerts, and frequent cultural events all help to make Chico an appealing destination.We partner with experts across California and the United States to provide relevant practical experience through site visits and participatory workshops. Past programs within California have included the capitol city of Sacramento for topics on government and education,\u00a0Mount Lassen Volcanic National Park and Muir Woods National Monument for conservation and history, and many local schools, and businesses for insight into practices on the community level. Many programs include a study tour component, which takes participants to other areas of the country to experience different regions and lifestyles. We have partnerships in Chicago, Illinois, Kansas City, Missouri, and Washington, DC, just to name a few.Experienced StaffGlobal ExperienceInternational Training Programs management staff have personal experience across the globe, including countries from every region of the world except Antarctica. Their experience with international cultures and communication styles allow program staff to anticipate participants' needs and to communicate and act in ways that minimize cultural barriers and misunderstandings. The result is a focus on respectful, honest communication, programs that respond to trainees\u2019 real needs, and a commitment to developing long-term professional relationships that extend well beyond the program\u2019s end.Program HistoryITP has a long history of successful training programs beginning in 1992. Since then, we have completed over 80 programs with both federal and private funders, and participants from countries spanning the globe. \u00a0Information is available on this website for current International Programs and also on past international training programs.

We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.Contact UsNeed Help?FacebookFacebookTwitterTwitterInstagramInstagramReport an accessibility issueReport a broken link on this pageTitle IXPrivacy PolicyCalifornia State University, Chico400 West First StreetChico, CA 95929Copyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n",
