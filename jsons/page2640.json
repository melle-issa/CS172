Professor Onishi will delve into the historical roots of white Christian nationalism and its impact on American democracy, as witnessed in the January 6th attack at the Capitol. Drawing on his personal experience growing up within the movement, Professor Onishi will provide unique insights into the topic.\u00a0\nAfter serving seven years in the evangelical ministry, Onishi pursued a master\u2019s in theology at Oxford University where he re-examined his faith and began to study religion from a historical lens. Onishi subsequently received a doctorate in religious studies from the University of California Santa Barbara.\nSince then Onishi has taught and researched Christian nationalism; the history of evangelicalism; race and racism in American religion, gender, sex, masculinity; and secularism and secularity.\u00a0\nScholar, teacher, thought leader and co-host of the Straight White American Jesus (SWAJ) podcast (a top 50 in political show on the Apple Podcasts chart), Onishi has authored \u201cPreparing for War: The Extremist History of White Christian Nationalism \u2014 and What Comes Next.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBradley Onishi is one of the leading thinkers on one of the most important topics shaping American culture today,\u201d said Cal Poly religious studies Professor Stephen Lloyd-Moffett. \u201cHis insights stem not just from his rigorous academic research but from growing up within the movement.\u201d\nDon't miss this opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of one of the most pressing issues shaping American culture today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFooter\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nCampus Master Calendar\nCal Poly News\nEvent Submissions\n\n\n\n\nExplore\n\n\nPerforming Arts Center\nCal Poly Athletics\nASI Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday\n\n\nCal Poly CampusClouds54\u2109\nCal Poly PierTides2:13 PMLow8:43 PMHigh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Grand Avenue,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSan Luis Obispo, CA 93407\n\n805-756-1111\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Footer Primary\n\n\nUniversity Home\n\n\nMy Cal Poly Portal\n\n\nCampus Map\n\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\n\nHealth and Wellbeing\n\n\nCampus Safety\n\n\n\n\nGlobal Footer Secondary\n\n\nPrivacy Notice\n\n\n\n\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\n\nWeb Accessibility Statement\n\n\n\n\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\nCampus Annual Security Report (PDF)\n\n\n\n\nCampus Safety Plan (PDF)\n\n\n\n\nPDF Reader\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Learn by DoingSM has been Cal Poly\u2019s pedagogy since 1901\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a9\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2023\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCalifornia Polytechnic State University\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
