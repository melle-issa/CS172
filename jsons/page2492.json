WSCUC accredits higher education institutions in California, Hawaii and some around the world.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work and it\u2019s grueling, but it\u2019s also very prestigious \u2026 it\u2019s a very high level of responsibility to serve on a WSCUC accreditation team,\u201d Bersi says.\nBersi, who earned her doctorate in organizational leadership from Pepperdine University, got involved with WSCUC 13 years ago. She was a commissioner, chaired different committees, and has served on several accreditation visit teams. She also served on the board of Western Association of College and University Business Officers and chaired two of its committees.\nThat\u2019s all in addition to her role at Chapman, in which she manages the university\u2019s endowment and investments. Although she has been in her current position for a few years, she first came to Chapman in 2006 to serve as vice president of finance and CFO.\nShe brought with her a broad range of financial and management experience from working at the foundation of her alma mater, California State University, Long Beach. She was at Chapman for three years, then went to California State University, Dominguez Hills, where she was responsible for a $90 million academic affairs budget.\nWhen the Great Recession hit, she and her colleagues had to figure out how to manage a university significantly reduced by the state in 2009.\n\u201cYou really have to understand all of the intricacies of the academy and its operations and work with a lot of different people to negotiate and get things accomplished,\u201d says Bersi, who also taught as a tenured professor at the graduate level at Dominguez Hills.\nChapman recruited her to return and start the investment office after the Board of Trustees voted in December 2018 to make the growth of Chapman\u2019s endowment a major strategic priority. The endowment\u2019s market value at the time was just below $400 million. The endowment initiative was undertaken because a study of peer institutions showed that it is prudent to have internal management of endowment operations once the endowment reaches $500 million, Bersi says.\nThat goal was surpassed in 2020-21, and today the endowment stands at over $600 million.\n\u201cAs the Chapman endowment grew, it was necessary to establish our investment office and to form a team exclusively devoted to managing our endowment,\u201d says Trustee Jim Burra, who chairs the Board Investment Committee. \u201cWe were fortunate to recruit Janna Bersi. She established the office, built the management systems and hired an outstanding staff.\n\u201cJanna\u2019s foresight allows Chapman to handle significant growth in the endowment. As a trustee and chairman of the Investment Committee, I am confident that Janna will continue her outstanding efforts in the pursuit of our ambitious goals,\u201d he says.\nIn February 2019, the National Association of College and University Business Officers reported that Chapman\u2019s endowment was the third-fastest growing private university endowment in the nation. Bersi is quick to share credit for the accomplishment.\n\u201cIt will take and does take a village,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary effort on behalf of the university and in particular its Board of Trustees and leadership.\u201d\nAnother \u201cvillage\u201d effort Bersi is part of is Chapman\u2019s new strategic plan, which sets an ambitious $2 billion endowment goal for 2037.\n\u201cWhy would we strive for such an audacious target? Because Chapman, in rising to national rankings, is competing with a new pool of peer institutions \u2013 most of which are heavily endowed,\u201d she says. \u201cNot only will we be better positioned to compete, but a significantly larger endowment will provide for the very long-term support of academic programs and research that we do not currently have.\u201d\n\u201cGenerations of students will benefit from the support that our efforts today will establish.\u201d\n\n\nJanna Bersi visits Amity University in India in September 2022 with WSCUC.Janna Bersi visits Amity University in India in September 2022 with WSCUC.Janna Bersi visits Amity University in India in September 2022 with WSCUC.Janna Bersi visits Amity University in India in September 2022 with WSCUC.\n\n\nendowment investments strategic plan WSCUC \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJoy Juedes \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney Teaches Law Students How to Hang Their Own Shingle\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pandemic* Effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Asia-Pacific Initiative Offers Unique Take on Hotbed Region Growing up in Los Angeles, Robert Koepp became fascinated with Asia.
