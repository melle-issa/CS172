people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.Contact UsNeed Help?FacebookFacebookTwitterTwitterInstagramInstagramReport an accessibility issueReport a broken link on this pageTitle IXPrivacy PolicyCalifornia State University, Chico400 West First StreetChico, CA 95929Copyright \u00a9 2023 All Rights Reserved\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n",
