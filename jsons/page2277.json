The Hilbert Collection \u2013 which includes oils, watercolors and drawings of urban and industrial scenes, coastal views, farms, ranches and landscapes of everyday life \u2013 is a significant repository of images of the 20th century by California artists, celebrating the unique artistic and cultural development of the Golden State.\n\n\n\n    Plan your visit\n  \n\n\n\n\n    make Reservation\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening Early 2024The Hilbert is Expanding!The excitement is building (literally!) as construction continues on the Hilbert Museum\u2019s long-awaited expansion. The expanded museum, set to open in early 2024, will be nearly triple the size of the original museum, growing from 7,500 square feet to more than 22,000 square feet.\n\n\n\n    LEARN ABOUT THE EXPANSION\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOUR LOCATION Until 2024The Hilbert TemporaryDuring the renovation, which is expected to take about one year, selections from the museum\u2019s collection of California scene paintings will be on display at a temporary location in Old Towne Orange. The new site is located at 216 E.
