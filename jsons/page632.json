The ways to make a difference are as diverse as our donors: scholarships; endowed chairs and professorships; special programs and centers; the building and renovation of facilities. We salute the many donors since our founding who have helped CSUF become the exceptional institution it is today, and invite you to join their distinguished ranks.\n2020 Honor Roll \u00a0 Ontiveros Legacy Society\n\n\n\n\nLifting Up Former Foster Youth\"This amazing  Guardian Scholars program has changed, and quite possibly, saved my life,\u201d says Jorge Cardenas.\n\nCar Collection Fuels Scientific ResearchThe groundbreaking detection of gravitational waves prompted  Nicholas and Lee Begovich, to make one of the largest philanthropic investments in the history of Cal State Fullerton \u2014 a collection of 14 classic sports cars valued at $10 million.\n\nLifeline for Families in NeedCSUF\u2019s Center for Healthy Neighborhoods  serves families living on an annual income of less than $25,000.
