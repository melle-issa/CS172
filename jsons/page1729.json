Rice has authored more than a half dozen books including Between Appear and Disappear, Dream Memoirs of a Fabulist, A Good Cuntboy is Hard to Find, and his first novel, Blood of Mugwump that was selected by Kathy Acker as a runner-up for the FC2 First Novel Award. He has been published in numerous literary journals, anthologies, and magazines including Avant Pop: Fiction for a Daydream Nation, Biting the Error, Discourse, Zyzzyva, and Gargoyle.\nDoug Rice earned his BA in English from Slippery Rock State College, a MA in creative writing at SUNY-Binghamton, a MA in English Literature at Duquesne University, and studied for his PhD in Literature at the University of Pittsburgh. He spent some earlier years teaching at La Roche College and Kent State University-Salem and is currently teaching Creative Writing, literary theory, and film history and theory at Sacramento State University. He is also an artist-in-residence at the Akademie Schloss Solitude, Stuttgart, Germany. His work has been translated into Polish, Spanish, French, Portuguese, and German.\nRice will be reading from his two recent publications, Dream Memoirs of a Fabulist and Between Appear and Disappear, as well as showing work from his book When Love Was. Though the genre distinction \u201cmemoir\u201d is used in title and description of his more recent work, it is far from the traditional notion we are drawn to when we hear that word. These books share and explore the story through text and photograph, between narrative and poem. Threads of identity and relationship between individuals are layered upon the relationship between the author to the words on the page with consideration to the reader being an integral part of the pages, words, photos, and structure in the landscape of the physical book itself. Rice wants the reader to be aware of the importance of their interaction with what he is offering in the conjunction between story and art.\nWhen asked about Rice\u2019s more recent work, Professor Paul Eggers said, \u201cHe\u2019s unlike any other writer we\u2019ve brought to campus, in that he\u2019s avant-garde. Though his two latest books are called \u201cmemoir,\u201d they represent, to my mind, the farthest reaches of what you can do and still call something in the realm of memoir. His work combines narrative\u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible with Doug to further classify it as fiction or nonfiction\u2014photography and even, in the case of Dream Memoirs, incorporating a tactile element to the act of reading. I think it\u2019s fair to say that he attempts to break down our habitual distinctions between self and other, between gendered identities, between memory and reality, and between language and the material world.\u201d\nFor a peek into his handmade book, Dream Memoirs of a Fabulist, check out this video about his collaboration with Stephanie Sauer of Copilot Press.\nHere he discusses his unique approach to storytelling\nPlease join us for an exciting evening with Doug Rice, Thursday, October 23rd at 7:30 pm in Langdon 300. Thanks to contributions made by the Department of English and the College of Humanities and Fine Arts, Writer\u2019s Voice readings are free and open to the public.\n\u00a0\nBy Charles Walker\n\n \n\nOctober 22, 2014watershedcsuc Appear and Disappear, CSUC, Doug Rice, Sacramento State University, Slippery Rock State College, Writer's Voice\nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlogroll\n\nDiscuss\nGet Inspired\nGet Polling\nGet Support\nLearn WordPress.com\nTheme Showcase\nWordPress Planet\nWordPress.com News\n\n\nTopics\n\nIntern Spotlight\n\nUncategorized\n\n\nUpcoming Events No upcoming events\nArchives\n\nMay 2022\nMarch 2022\nMay 2020\nOctober 2019\nMay 2019\nApril 2019\nOctober 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nApril 2017\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nDecember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nApril 2014\nFebruary 2014\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nAugust 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nFebruary 2013\nJanuary 2013\n\n \n\nFollow me on TwitterMy Tweets \n\n\n\n\nBlog at WordPress.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
