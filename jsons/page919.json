You\u2019ve got\u00a0Tartan Soul. There are four qualities that show the world you\u2019re a Highlander: Integrity, Accountability, Excellence and Respect.\nAs a UCR student, you\u2019ve always exhibited these values. You wouldn\u2019t have been accepted to UCR if you hadn\u2019t!\n\n\nNow is the time to demonstrate your Tartan Soul. Act with integrity, be accountable individually and for your ethical conduct, strive for excellence, and respect the rights and dignity of others. As you mature and take on more responsibility, you will\u00a0see how\u00a0these important values \u2013 the \u201ccore four\u201d of your\u00a0Tartan Soul\u00a0\u2013 will help you to earn the trust and respect of others, work more\u00a0efficiently, and succeed in ways you never imagined.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nExcellence\nLeading With Excellence\n\n\n \n\nRespect\nA Campus of Respect\n\n\n \n\nIntegrity\nLiving with Integrity\n\n\n \n\nAccountability\nCommunity with Accountability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Four Colors of the UCR Tartan represent the four core values of Tartan Soul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Soul Was Born\n\n\nIn 2005, the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) put forth a Statement of Ethical Values. The UC Regents recognized and adopted the four values: integrity, accountability, excellence and respect. UCR embraced these values with the Tartan Soul campaign which was created by the Student Life Orientation Team.\nThe campaign debuted in 2009 at UCR\u2019s Bear Facts summer orientation program. During orientation, all incoming, first-year students were introduced to the four values by the Dean of Students and given tartan lapel pins.\n\n\nThe Dean explained each value and provided examples of students embodying Tartan Soul. Each value was linked to one of the four colors of the UCR Tartan. Integrity is represented by blue, accountability by white, excellence by gold\u00a0and respect by black. Throughout that summer, the campaign experienced huge success.\nNow it\u2019s time to make the Tartan Soul campaign bigger and better. We\u2019re asking students, faculty and staff to promote Tartan Soul. Find new ways to show your soul, recognize people who exhibit the four values\u00a0and wear UCR\u2019s tartan whenever possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUCR Highlanders strive to represent integrity, accountability, excellence and respect every day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've Got Soul!\nBrave Scots\u00a0one and all, the tartan clan of UCR stands together! Click a portrait below to see how some Highlanders exemplify our core Tartan Soul values!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaghad Tabaza\n\nAdvocate, facilitator, collaborator, and mentor.

This is why Raghad is a shining example of Tartan Soul Respect.\n\nRespect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJamal Myrick\n\nBeing a resident director means more than just making sure things run smoothly in the residential halls. As an RD, Jamal Myrick is also an adviser, counselor, organizer and a problem solver. Accomplishing his duties while still making each resident in Lothian feel at home illustrates why Jamal exemplifies all four Tartan Soul values.\n\nAccountability\nIntegrity\nExcellence\nRespect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaura Dimler\n\nLaura Dimler goes above and beyond what many students expect of their TA.

But at UCR, it is not unusual to see our students inspire others as well. And Bryant Glover is no exception. As a student of SoBA, he has been known to not only push himself, but to push everyone\u00a0to a high\u00a0standard. It's no surprise Bryant embodies Accountability.\n\nAccountability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetsu Shigematsu\n\nAs an Associate Professor in the Media & Cultural Studies Department, Setsu Shigematsu greatly demonstrates passion and excellence within her classes.

After contacting UCPD, she mobilized a team of students to move water up the staircase to extinguish it quickly. Danna demonstrated\u00a0calmness in the face of danger.
