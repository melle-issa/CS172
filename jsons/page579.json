If you know where to look, you\u2019ll likely catch a glimpse of the International Space Station as it charts its well-trodden easterly course across the sky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\u00a0esearchers from five international space agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), live and work on the station in what is one of the world\u2019s most ambitious multinational collaborative projects. Their research is well documented on NASA\u2019s ISS blog and includes such wide-ranging topics as the effects of space travel on the human body, materials science, dark matter, spacecraft systems and countless other topics over the station\u2019s over 21-year history.\nBut an additional source of endless fascination is the astronauts\u2019 daily life in a vessel about the size of a football field, floating in microgravity with an international crew of seven people.\nHow do the astronauts wash their hair? (rinseless shampoo); sleep? (in a bag and attached to the wall); spend their free time? (mostly looking out the window, according to NASA). The ISS has been fastidiously designed to maximize the health, productivity and comfort of the crew while optimizing the efficient use of space and supplies.\nBut even as the mundane aspects of daily life are accounted for, questions remain about the more elusive but nonetheless riveting topic of culture. How do crewmembers on the ISS interact with each other and with equipment and spaces? And how do the spaces, interactions and objects inform conflict or cooperation among the crew?\n\u201cIt\u2019s a microsociety in a miniworld,\u201d says Chapman University\u2019s Justin Walsh, associate professor and interim chair of the Department of Art. Walsh, an archaeologist by training, is using archaeology\u2019s methods of inquiry and analysis \u2013 in which the objects and spaces of a culture are analyzed to provide insight into how humans adapt to their environment \u2013 to reveal new understanding of human activity in space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchaeologist and Chapman Associate Professor and Interim Chair of the Department of Art conducted the first archaeological study aboard a spacecraft with co-principal investigator Alice Gorman of Flinders University in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Past Is Right Now\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with co-principal investigator Alice Gorman of Flinders University in Australia, Walsh just completed Sampling Quadrangle Assemblages Research Experiment (SQuARE), the first archaeological study ever performed outside the Earth.\nPeople tend to understand archaeology as dealing with the distant past. But at its core, the discipline is primarily concerned with a type of evidence \u2013 material culture \u2013 regardless of when that culture existed.\n\u201cThe past is right now \u2013 what happened 10 seconds ago is the past and is equally available for archaeological research as something a millennia ago,\u201d explains Walsh.\nIn his view, archaeological techniques can be used to understand what happened at a distinct time \u2013 including the present \u2013 and what humans did in that location to adapt to it. \u201cSo, the question of when and where is irrelevant,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat we are showing with this project is the potentially practical side of archaeology as a science. We are revealing aspects of a habitat that people have lived in for over 20 years, and that the very people inhabiting it 24/7 have not been aware of.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA astronaut Kayla Barron places the first pieces of tape to mark a sample location for the SQuARE experiment in the Japanese Experiment Module (Kibo) on January 15, 2022.

Responding to what was happening at Morgantina, the class focused on cultural heritages that need to be protected. \u201cOne day a student said, \u2018What about stuff in space?\u2019 Bing. Lightbulb. As soon as she asked the question, I thought, of course, stuff in space is heritage too,\u201d Walsh recalls.\nConsider Tranquility Base, the site where the crew of Apollo 11 first set foot on the moon. For more than 53 years, it has remained undisturbed \u2013 no wind, no return visitors, no water, no erosion. What protections are in place to preserve the integrity of the site \u2013 to protect it from the fate that befell Morgantina?\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of a site that might be more significant in the history of humanity \u2013 it was the first time any human had set foot on something that wasn\u2019t the Earth,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cSpace is international territory, like the high seas or Antarctica. No country has sovereignty. So, the implication is that, unlike Earth, no one government can say it\u2019s protected. What happens to that site when we have tourists on the moon?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Tools for an Old Trade\n\n\n\n\nThe most basic archaeological technique for sampling a site is the test pit. Archaeologists divide a site into a grid of squares, usually one meter by one meter, then select individual squares to dig in so that they can get a better sense of what the site is like and plan their future excavation strategy.\nFor the SQuARE project, the researchers asked the astronauts aboard the ISS to create one-meter squares on walls using tape throughout the space station \u2013 six in total. Instead of digging them to reveal new layers of soil representing different moments in the site\u2019s history, the crew photographed each of the squares once per day to identify how those spaces were being used and how they changed over time. In a traditional test pit, each stratum of soil reveals a new layer of geographical insight and glimpse into cultural history \u2013 depth tells the story. On the ISS, it is not depth that reveals the vicissitudes of history and culture, but time.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re doing a terrestrial dig, you are present in the landscape, you are constantly assessing what is being found, and it is an unrepeatable experiment \u2013 the work is destructive by necessity. The very act of uncovering an object is a threat to its continued survival,\u201d explains Walsh.\nNot so with photography.\nIn 2009, Jason De Le\u00f3n, Ph.D., an archaeologist from UCLA, gave migrants from Central America to the U.S. disposable cameras to document their journeys, in what may be the first archaeological research done with photographs. It was also the first time researchers could look at a cultural phenomenon from an archaeological \u2013 vs. historical \u2013 perspective that they couldn\u2019t directly observe.\n\u201cJason\u2019s work was the impetus for us to look at photography as a viable method for space archaeology. We\u2019ve also been using archive photos. The sole data is the photograph. But we can go back to those photographs over and over again\u2014it\u2019s a repeatable experiment,\u201d explains Walsh.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re doing a terrestrial dig, you are present in the landscape, you are constantly assessing what is being found, and it is an unrepeatable experiment \u2013 the work is destructive by necessity. The very act of uncovering an object is a threat to its continued survival,\u201d explains Walsh.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcavating Space\n\n\n\n\nIn his 2013 book \u201cConsumerism in the Ancient World,\u201d Walsh explores the acquisition of Greek pottery by ancient peoples who were not Greek, even though the shapes of the earthenware were specific to Greek practices and behavior and were decorated with images from Greek mythology. He found that many of these pieces ended up buried intact in tombs, which typically identifies them as prized possessions, likely only used in a funerary context. Zooming out, that research provides a framework for identifying the ways in which objects take on different meanings in new contexts; the linkages between the consumption of goods and identity construction; and how people use objects to signal social status and other information to others in their community. In many ways, the SQUaRE team\u2019s early analysis of the ISS also conforms to this framework.\nTake the galley, in the ISS Node 1 (Unity), where the crew\u2019s dining table attaches to the wall and condiments are held tight into mesh bags attached to the wall. A bar of dark chocolate seems to shrink over the course of days; a tin of Altoids moves around; and one day, most curiously, several tubes of different colored frosting appeared.\nA later Instagram Reel by U.S. astronaut Kayla Barron revealed that she and fellow astronaut Thomas Marshburn had made a birthday cake for a Russian crewmember Pyotr Dubrov using muffin tops glued together with honey, which was then decorated with the frosting.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s an interesting phenomenon, because that\u2019s cooking, and cooking has a lot of social implications, especially a birthday cake,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cIt shows that you care about somebody else and that they\u2019re special to you. Cooking is something that you really cannot do in microgravity \u2013 they usually just eat bags or cans of food. This shows us that exercising a sense of control and curating the experience of fresh ingredients is part of the culture of the American crew on the International Space Station.\u201d\nAnother inference Walsh made was the adaptation of U.S. Node 2 (Harmony), a maintenance workstation, into an ad hoc laboratory space. An experimental bag takes up residence in the frame for a few days, which Walsh later learned was for experimenting with concrete production in microgravity.\n\u201cFrom an archaeological perspective, I wouldn\u2019t have known that they are making concrete there, but I can determine that science is happening there, and it speaks to the flexibility of the location,\u201d Walsh says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sample location, the galley area in the NASA Node 1 module (Harmony) on the International Space Station, for the Sampling Quadrangle Assemblages Research Experiment (SQuARE). The area to be sampled is marked at the corners by yellow tape.\nPhoto credit: NASA/International Space Station Archaeological Project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunch of Brick Moon\n\n\n\n\nThe insights gained on material culture in space gleaned on the ISS will continue to have import long after the SQuARE study ends.\nEnter: Brick Moon, the space-habitat consultancy being formed by Walsh and his colleagues. Named for the first work of fiction that described space launch, written by Edward Everett Hale in 1869, Brick Moon aims to use the firsthand knowledge gained from the SQuARE study to provide design guidance for companies and organizations with sights on building new space stations in the coming decades \u2013 companies such as Blue Origin, Orbital Reef, Star Lab and Axiom, Brick Moon\u2019s implementation partner.\n\u201cWe are the ones providing a view into the past,\u201d says Walsh in reference to the SQuARE data. \u201cSo we can help design the efficiencies needed in a space habitat in advance of launch, since we can\u2019t easily modify space after a station goes up.\u201d\nOne such design efficiency is what co-researcher Alice Gorman has dubbed \u201cgravity surrogates\u201d \u2013 technologies, such as Velcro patches on the wall, that simulate gravity. \u201cIn the SQuARE photos, we\u2019ve been looking at where lots of these restraints appear. We see them increase over time and can also see glue on the wall where a patch has fallen away. Going forward, designers and engineers will want to be thinking about accommodations for microgravity environments. What we learn from the photos can inform those decisions.\u201d\nWhen the American ISS astronauts returned Earthside last spring, Walsh had the opportunity to meet with them and discuss the experiment. As Walsh recalls, the astronauts shared that they thought the researchers would be bored with the pictures.\n\u201cI assured them \u2013 \u2018that\u2019s not the case.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency \n\nMedia ContactsCerise Valenzuela Metzger\n\nDirector of Public Relations\n(714) 289-3143 (office)\n(657) 390-6760  (cell)\ncmetzger@chapman.edu\n\nOffice of Public Relations\n\nPR@chapman.edu \n\nNewsroom SiteChapman Magazine\n\nChapman Forward\nCOVID-19 Resources\n\nChapman Site\nVisit Chapman\nView Tuition and Aid\nApply Now\nEmployment \n\nServices & PoliciesAccessibility Feedback \nWebsite Feedback \nDisability Services \nDirectory Emergency \nConsumer Disclosures \nPrivacy Policy Title IX \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2023\u00a0Chapman University           \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\nAlumni\nArts & Film\nBusiness & Economy\nCampus & Students\nCollege Knowledge\nCommunity\nCOVID-19\nHealth & Behavior\nHumanities & Society\nScience & Engineering\nUniversity News\n\n\nOur Voices\nCOVID-19 Resources\nMagazines\n\nChapman Magazine\nChapman Forward\n\n\nPress Room\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
