Check out our two English language programs designed to improve English comprehension while becoming an active participant of the Sonoma State University student body.\n\n\n\n\nI've been here for 6 months, and am completely satisfied with my life here. I've had lots of opportunities to improve my English in SSALI, and I also met great teachers and gorgeous friends. All of them are so friendly just like my family. I bet you'll love SSALI!\n\n\nThe opportunity to study abroad in a safe area was extremely gratifying for me.\n\n\nThe teachers are very nice, kind and try to do their best for the students.\n\n\nWhenever you are in trouble, the teachers will help you with pleasure.\n\n\nI live in a homestay and my host family is like my friend. They try to talk and speak with me even though my English is not good.\n\n\nYou can choose some classes, such as TOEFL, American Film, American Culture, Pronunciation, and Computer.\n\n\nI met such nice teachers, friends and host family at SSALI. I like all of them. I'm enjoying wonderful days.\n\n\nStudying at SSALI is an excellent experience. I have met friends who helped me practice my English.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool of Extended and International Education\n\nSEIE Home\nBrowse All Programs & Courses\nAcademic Calendars\nInformation Sessions\nInternational Programs$5,000 International Student Scholarship\nUniversity Preparation Program\nAcademic Culture and English Program\nSemester at Sonoma\nSonoma State and Santa Rosa Junior College Pathway\nWorldChat\n\nOpen University/Door\nFrequently Asked Questions\nResources for Students\nResources for Faculty\nSEIE Curriculum Committee\nCampus Services\nAbout SEIE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFacebook for SEIE \n\n\n Twitter for SEIE\n\n\nInstagram for SEIE\n\n\nYouTube for SEIE\n\n\nLinkedIn for SEIE\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Lifelong Learning \u00a0 \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSU Facebook\nSSU Twitter\nSSU Instagram\nSSU Youtube\nSSU News RSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Ave\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n707.664.2880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact SSU\nPrivacy Notice\nCalifornia State University\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSafeSSU\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\nEmergency Information\nJobs\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
