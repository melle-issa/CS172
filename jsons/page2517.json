It's one of the best online productivity tools for those often finding themselves traveling, in flights, in online meetings or just calling friends and family abroad.\nCarefully thought out design lets it effortlessly compare multiple time zones at a glance, plan conference calls, webinars, international phone calls and web meetings. It also aids with business travel & tracking of market hours.\nWTB was born out of frustration with existing world clock apps, online meeting and time conversion tools. Most of them have given up on providing quality business tools and on delighting their users.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\n\n1\n\n\t\tAdd locations (or remove, set home, order)\n\n\n2\n\n\t\tMouse over hours to convert time at a glance\n\n\t\n\n3\n\n\t\tClick hour tiles to schedule and share\n\n\n+\n\n\t\tSign in to save settings - it's FREE!\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2011-23 Helloka, LLC\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0worldtimebuddy.com\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0About\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Feedback\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Mobile App\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0News (Twitter)Chrome App\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Privacy\u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u00a0Terms of Service\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JAVASCRIPT for this page to work properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n",
