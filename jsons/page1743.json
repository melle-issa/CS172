(Image credit: Keith Uyeda)\n\nThese are just a few of the many unwanted items Stanford University sustainability waste specialist Haley Todd has recovered on campus as part of Residential & Dining Enterprises\u2019 (R&DE) efforts to reduce, reuse, recycle, or compost materials that might otherwise end up in a trash bin.\nPart of Todd\u2019s job is to oversee Give & Go, a year-round donation program. Sustainability is a core value in R&DE and the organization has been supporting reuse for more than two decades (and recycling for many more). The Give & Go program, formalized in 2013, expanded those efforts significantly. In 10 years, Give & Go, known among students for the images of alpacas that accompany its branding (\u201cAlpaca my stuff \u2026\u201d), has diverted 456 tons of waste from landfills, including through innovative partnerships with local community organizations and the First-Generation and/or Low-Income (FLI) Student Success Center on campus. Give & Go is just one part of R&DE\u2019s sustainability program, which in turn is part of Stanford\u2019s broader mission to achieve zero waste by 2030. (Stanford has placed first in the National Wildlife Federation\u2019s Campus Race to Zero competition in the per-capita recycling category for two years in a row.)\nThe Office of Sustainability\u2019s Julie Muir, manager of Stanford\u2019s zero waste program, says Give & Go is a huge part of sustainability efforts on campus.\n\u201cThe hierarchy in waste management is waste reduction, then reuse, which is what Give & Go is all about,\u201d Muir says. \u201cThe amount of material they donate is truly amazing.\u201d\nThe flagship of the Give & Go program is Stanford\u2019s move-out period in June when more than 7,000 students leave campus within a week\u2019s time. Todd coordinates with Goodwill Industries, which provides several trailers around campus, but also sends her team \u2013 mostly interns and volunteers \u2013 to monitor dumpsters and recover any materials that can be recycled or redistributed.\nBut the Give & Go program is available to students throughout the year. Fourteen stations that support Recycle for Change, a nonprofit that donates or sells used clothes, shoes, and other goods, are located around campus. And Todd and her team regularly survey trash enclosures for potential treasures and coordinate with anyone who has items they don\u2019t want to go to waste.\nIn addition to Goodwill and Recycle for Change, Give & Go partners with several community organizations, including the Bay Area Furniture Bank, the Mattress Recycling Council (which took 17 tons of mattresses from campus last year), several food banks, and a group that provides toiletries to farm workers.\nOne of Give & Go\u2019s main on-campus partners is the student-run First-Generation and/or Low-Income Partnership (FLIP). Each fall, FLIP, Give & Go, and Students for Sustainable Stanford host a FLI Drive featuring recovered items that students may arrive on campus in need of, such as bikes, mini-fridges, microwaves, and other items. In October 2022, 530 FLI students took home Give & Go items in a single day. Todd also holds mini-FLI drives whenever she collects a critical mass of material.\nIn addition, Give & Go works with Roble Reuse, which keeps assorted business attire that students can borrow for interviews.\nTodd loves her matchmaking role, which facilitates the circular economy. The bales of hay \u2013 left over from a Halloween party \u2013 could have been composted, but instead, Todd gave them to the gardeners at R&DE\u2019s Oak Road and Lane B BeWell community gardens.\nInspiring students is part of R&DE\u2019s sustainability mission. Each year, the office takes on several Sustainability Interns, who work on new ways to reduce waste on campus. Past interns designed Give & Go\u2019s alpaca branding campaign; more recently, an intern started a food swap box in a dormitory laundry room. Samantha Bunke, a third-year chemical engineering PhD student studying plastic waste management in the Tarpeh Lab, has been working for nearly two years on a longer-term project, which is to create a zero-waste education facility on campus. The center would include on-site composting, a facility to audit waste streams more easily and regularly (to make sure materials end up in the right place), research opportunities for faculty and students \u2013 like Bunke \u2013 who are studying waste, and community education components.\nBunke started as an R&DE intern and is now a Living Lab Fellow with the Office of Sustainability. For her project, Bunke regularly meets with faculty, students, and staff to discuss the future zero-waste center. But, even with that commitment and her research responsibilities, she still finds time to dumpster dive with Todd and the Give & Go team.\n\u201cWorking in a lab, everything is more abstract,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t really see it. [With Give & Go], I am literally getting up on the dumpsters, reaching in, and pulling stuff out. It\u2019s so much fun.\u201d\nMuir says every effort counts in the fight to reduce waste.\n\u201cThere is no one-size-fits-all\u201d solution, she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t need an all-or-nothing solution. We need several solutions that take us down a journey that gets us to that end result.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlpaca Your Stuff\nResidential And Dining Enterprises\nStanford News\nThe Circular Economy\nSustainability\n\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to read next:\n\n\n\n\n \nAcademic Council\nReport of the president: Academic Council Professoriate appointments\nThe following Academic Council Professoriate appointments, promotions, and reappointments for the periods indicated were reviewed by the Advisory Board of the Academic Council on Jan. 17, Jan. 31, Feb. 7, Feb. 21, Feb. 28, and March 7, 2023, and were approved by the president.
