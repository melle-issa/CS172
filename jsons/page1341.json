It was Chapman\u2019s third time at the November competition, which focuses on using negotiation skills to resolve a conflict.\nFowler School of Law\u2019s negotiation team with their award.\n\u201cAs the world gets smaller in terms of the ability and need to communicate across cultures, opportunities like this are key,\u201d says Professor Nancy Schultz, who directs the law school\u2019s advocacy and dispute resolution certificate and competition programs. \u201cWe all need to remember that we are far more similar than different.\u201d\nTeam members said the competition let them experience both similarities and differences in cultures.\n\u201cThe opportunity to represent Chapman on the global stage was enticing, but the most appealing aspect was the chance to explore a completely foreign part of the world and meet people from countries and cultures that I\u2019ve only read about,\u201d Makin says.\nAmin, who competed for the second year in a row, says the practice of alternative dispute resolution \u201cseems to unify advocates from across the world because the goal is to find creative solutions to problems.\u201d\n\u201cIt was beautiful to see all of us bring our own unique approach to resolving disputes and learn and grow from one another.\u201d\nCompeting against teams from around the world forced the team to \u201crethink how we communicate and what assumptions we are making,\u201d Makin says.\nKazarian says he got to \u201cexperience styles of negotiation I might otherwise not encounter.\u201d\nThe competition\u2019s final round was held at a tent camp in the desert and included traditional food and entertainment. Amin, an Arabic speaker whose parents immigrated to the United States from Syria, enjoyed sharing what he understood of the local culture.\n\u201cEven so, parts of the experience were a culture shock because the Emiratis are so unique and kind in their approach to everything,\u201d he says.\nThe three men enjoyed their time in the United Arab Emirates, where multicultural Dubai has seemingly \u201cpopped out of thin air in the past few decades,\u201d says Makin, who made his first trip to the Middle East.\nSchultz says she is always excited to give students chances to travel abroad.\n\u201cWe all need to get out of our comfort zones now and then,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd Chapman aims to shape global citizens \u2014 this is the perfect way to do that.\u201d\nMakin says the competition \u201copened my eyes to the breadth of opportunities that a law degree can create.\u201d\nThe chance to compete in Dubai differentiates Chapman, he says.\n\u201cWhether a student is interested in foreign diplomacy, professional sports, or something completely different, Chapman has an opportunity for anyone willing to put in the work to succeed,\u201d he says.\nKazarian says he felt fortunate to have the chance to compete internationally while experiencing a new culture.\u00a0\n\u201cI hope Chapman continues to offer this experience for law students in the future,\u201d he says.\n\n\nadvocacy Dale E.
