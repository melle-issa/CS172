In the realm of WordPress, this spark is the passion for innovation, collaboration, and creativity. WordCamp Jinja 2023 is proud to stand as a torchbearer in this journey, with a mission to empower the future generation of WordPress users: our students and their teachers.\nScheduled for the 4th and 5th of September, 2023, at Iganga Secondary School the prestigious girl\u2019s school in Eastern Uganda. WordCamp Jinja 2023 embraces the theme, \u201cThere is always more to learn!\u201d \u2013 adapted from the learn.wordpress.org platform. This year, we aim to create a platform for students and teachers to engage with the vibrant WordPress community, empowering them to harness the true potential of this versatile platform. \nBut WordCamp Jinja 2023 is not merely an exclusive domain for students and teachers. Oh no, dear friends! The invitation extends far and wide, reaching out to the local tech communities to partake in the festivities. We believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and WordPress is a great companion along the way. Whether you are a student, a teacher, a developer, a designer, a blogger, or an entrepreneur, there is always something new to discover and share with WordPress.\nThe event will feature hands-on and minds-on workshops that encourage participants to explore the depths of the Learn WordPress platform, while also offering an Entrepreneurship Track with breakout speaker presentations. The extra Contributor Day, scheduled for the 6th of September at The Innovation Village in Jinja, will feature a Website Hackathon to further engage and inspire the attendees as their skills are put to the test to create stunning websites with WordPress in a limited time, working in teams and competing for prizes and glory!.\nWe believe that by fostering a spirit of learning and collaboration, we can help shape the minds of the future, ensuring a legacy of innovation and progress. To achieve this, we are extending a warm invitation to speakers / trainers. If you have a story to tell, knowledge to share, or inspiration to spread, please submit your proposal through our Call for Speakers page: https://jinja.wordcamp.org/2023/call-for-speakers/\nWe are also seeking sponsors who believe in our mission and would like to support WordCamp Jinja 2023. Your contribution will not only help us create a memorable and impactful event but also pave the way for the future generation of WordPress users. If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, please visit our Call for Sponsors page: https://jinja.wordcamp.org/2023/call-for-sponsors/\nTogether, let us embark on a journey of learning and empowerment at WordCamp Jinja 2023, and create a brighter future for the next generation of WordPress enthusiasts at the heart of Africa and beyond!\nPS: WordCamp Jinja 2023 is the second WordCamp to be organised by Jinja WordPress Meetup, after a successful WordCamp Jinja 2022 on 2nd \u2013 3rd Sept last year at The Innovation Village in Jinja City. WordPress Jinja Meetup holds regular meetups for WordPress enthusiasts in Jinja and nearby towns.\n\n6 places, 1 WordCamp: WordCamp Jinja in Pictures\n\n\n#Kudos to the partners, speakers and participants who made the inaugural #WordCampJinja a success.
