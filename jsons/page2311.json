However, UCR also believes that out-of-state students add an important and valuable depth to our campus. \u00a0And as a top-ranking university, UCR sets high admission standards. Incoming students are selected based on a wide range of criteria, including academic performance\u00a0and the potential for success as an undergraduate.\nPrepare for admission to UCR with the Out-of-State First-Year Admission Checklist or the Out-of-State Transfer Admission Checklist.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n3.4\nMinimum Out-of-State High School GPA Requirement\n\n\n2.8\nMinimum Out-of-State Transfer GPA Requirement\n\n\n21:1\nStudent-to-Faculty Ratio\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut-of-State First-Year Students\nAlong with the minimum admissions requirements that California residents must meet, out-of-state applicants must also follow these instructions that apply specifically to them. If you are an international applicant studying in the United States but not in California, please follow these instructions for visa and U.S. entry requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\nUC Riverside will not consider SAT or ACT test scores when making admissions decisions or awarding scholarships. If you choose to submit test scores as part of your application, they may be used as an alternative method of fulfilling minimum requirements for eligibility or for course placement after you enroll. Details regarding UC\u2019s testing policy can be found online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Comprehensive Review    \n\nComprehensive review is the process by which UC Riverside (UCR) evaluates first-year applicants, who meet minimum UC requirements, using multiple measures of achievement and promise, while considering the context in which each student has demonstrated accomplishment. UCR will calculate an Academic Index Score (AIS) for all first-year applicants. The faculty of UCR have designated the measures described below to be used to calculate the AIS.\nHigh School GPA\u2014The strength of an applicant\u2019s high school GPA is the strongest indicator that a student will be successful within an academically challenging UC environment. The capped GPA is calculated on the basis of all completed \u201ca-g\u201d courses with extra points added for UC-approved honors courses taken in grades 10 and 11, capped at 8 semesters. A capped GPA considers the extra points earned for honors-level courses and may exceed 4.0 for some students.\nAdvanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses\u2014AP and IB courses prepare students for college-level coursework. Therefore, students who take and do well in these courses tend to have a high probability for success within the UC environment.\nEligibility in the Local Context (ELC)\u2014The Eligibility in the Local Context (ELC) program recognizes the individual accomplishments of students in light of the opportunities offered by their particular high school.\nLow Family Income\u2014Students who demonstrate high academic achievement, despite low socioeconomic status, are likely to exhibit persistence, maturity, and insight. Low family income is determined based on total family members and household income.\nFirst-Generation University Attendance\u2014 UC-eligible applicants who are the first in their immediate family to attend college are apt to have personal strengths that will contribute to their academic success. Students whose parents have not graduated from a four-year college or university are qualified for first-generation university attendance.\n\n\n\n\n            Subject Requirements    \n\nYou must earn a grade of C or better in all \u201ca-g\u201d courses and complete a minimum of 15 college-preparatory (\u201ca\u2013g\u201d) courses. There is no pre-approved course list for schools outside of California \u2014 refer to the \u201ca-g\u201d course list for types of classes out-of-state students should take to meet UC requirements. For students outside of California, \u201ca-g\u201d courses are the equivalent of college preparatory course.\nEleven of those 15 courses must be completed prior to your senior year. Find out if your course is UC approved, and if your college course or SAT/AP/IB exam score meets an \u201ca\u2013g\u201d requirement.\n\n\n\n\n            GPA Requirements    \n\nTo meet minimum out-of-state requirements, you must earn a GPA of 3.4 or higher in \u201ca\u2013g\u201d courses taken during grades 10 and 11 (including summers before and after), weighted by a maximum of eight semesters of UC-approved honors points, with no grade lower than a C.\nExtra Points for Honors Courses:\u00a0In calculating an out-of-state student's GPA, UC will grant honors weight for AP or IB courses only, but not for school-designated honors courses. The weight is given to letter grades of A, B, or C.\n\nA=5, B=4 and C=3; D or F=0 extra points.\nApproved honors-level courses may also include acceptable AP classes, higher- (and some standard-) level IB classes and transferable college courses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Gather Your Information    \n\nBefore you begin, find out what important information is needed for an accurate fall admission application.
