This year, it\u2019s CSUN President Erika D. Beck\u2019s turn for this regular evaluation.\nMembers of the university community are invited to offer comments that respond to specific criteria\u00a0that include questions about a campus president\u2019s general administration effectiveness, their working relations with the system and the campus and major achievements.\nThe following is the text of the letter issued by CSU Interim Chancellor Jolene Koester about the review, with a link to the criteria that will be addressed. Responses by letters or email are due to the Interim Chancellor\u2019s office by April 21, 2023. Responses must be signed and petitions will not be accepted.\nMarch 2023\nOpen Letter to the California State University, Northridge Community,\nThe CSU Board of Trustees has a policy requiring its presidents to be reviewed every three years. It is now time for the review of Dr. Erika D. Beck, president of California State University, Northridge.\nThis process is intended to provide feedback to the Board of Trustees and the Chancellor about the leadership of President Beck and the current state of affairs at CSU Northridge. It should also provide information that will further the university\u2019s progress and assist President Beck in the leadership of CSU Northridge.\nAs is the policy of the board, a number of officers of the university and the chairs of its major constituencies, the Faculty Senate, the Alumni Association, the Associated Students, and the University Advisory Board are being contacted for their comments with respect to specific criteria, which are cited below. A sampling of faculty, administrators/managers, staff, students, and community is also being invited to submit individual comments.\nIt is CSU policy to inform the university community of the review and to allow anyone not selected on an ex-officio or random basis to submit comments that respond to the specific criteria. The criteria are attached and also posted on the CSU website. Those wishing to submit confidential letters should keep in mind that every effort should be made to address the criteria and that neither unsigned letters nor petitions will be accepted. Please submit letters or emails no later than\u00a0April 21, 2023, addressed as follows:\nDr. Jolene Koester, Interim Chancellor\nThe California State University\n401 Golden Shore\nLong Beach, California 90802-4210\nEmail:\u00a0presidentreview@calstate.edu\nThe written responses will be summarized into a confidential report that will be discussed with Dr. Beck. The report will be presented to the Board of Trustees. None of the commentators will be identified by name, and responses will be treated in confidence to the extent permitted by the law.\nPlease keep in mind that this is intended to be a constructive process that should benefit the presidency and the university.\nSincerely,\nJolene Koester\nInterim Chancellor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Alumni, Associated Students, Community, CSUN, Students\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n\n\n\nCSUN Success Story: How Malachia Hoover\u2019s Time as a Matador Put Her on the Path to Saving Lives\n\n\nStudying Away \u2013 Get to Know the International and Exchange Student Center\n\n\nNew Tech and a Sense of Community: CSUN\u2019s Assistive Technology Conference Celebrates 38 Years\n\n\nCSUN to host multimedia performance that explores climate change\n\n\n\u2018Ghosts\u2019 Stories: On a Hit TV Show, CSUN Alum Uses His Voice\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u2190 \u2018Wizard\u2019 Investor and Alumnus Ramesh Damani Inspires Students at Nazarian College Speaker Series\nEY Gift to Support CSUN Accounting Students, Faculty \u2192\n\n\n\n\nTopicsArts and Culture\nAthletics\nBusiness\nCommunity\nEducation\nFaculty and Staff News\n\nFaculty and Staff Achievements\n\nHonors & Awards\nPresentations\nPublications\nResearch and Sponsored Projects\n\n\n\n\nHealth and Fitness\nMedia Releases\nPolitics and Society\nScience and Technology\n@CSUN Archive\nCSU News\n Unknown Feed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet the full  experience\n\nSubscribe Today\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe:\nRSS\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia State University, Northridge\nUniversity Advancement\nMarketing and Communications\n\t\t\t\t\t18111 Nordhoff Street, Northridge, CA 91330\n\t\t\t\t\tPhone: (818) 677-2130 / Contact Us\n\n\nContact Page Owner\nUniversity Policies\nAcrobat Reader\n\n\nCalifornia State University\nEmergency Information\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
