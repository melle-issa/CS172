This scholarship is dedicated to my parents, who have worked endlessly to allow me the opportunity they never had, of attending college. This scholarship means not only am I able to graduate with my bachelors degree debt free, but I am also able to continue my education to receive my credential, something that I never thought I would be able to do due to lack of financial support.
