Accommodations related to pregnancy for employees will continue to be coordinated through the ADA Program. We would like to remind the campus of the employer obligations to pregnant, parenting and/or nursing employees and students, as denial of these rights could be a potential gender equity issue.\u00a0\u00a0We highly encourage further distribution of this email to members of your leadership teams, faculty and staff.\nIn its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, Sonoma State University recognizes that many nursing, pregnant and/or parenting employees and students exist outside of the binary construction of gender; please be aware that some of the language below is reflective of legal text, which we recognize may be limiting in terms of identity.\u00a0 Thanks and credit go to the Title IX Office at San Francisco State University for sharing much of the following information with us:\nStudents who are Pregnant, Parenting or Nursing\nTitle IX is a federal law that prohibits sex and gender discrimination \u2014 including discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, and parental status \u2014 in the educational setting for all institutions that receive federal financial assistance.\u00a0 As such, Title IX protects people who are pregnant, parenting or nursing from discrimination.\u00a0 Here are some specific resources about our obligations in this regard:\nPregnancy in College\nFAQ: Breastfeeding Students\u00a0\nTitle IX Rights for Pregnant or Parenting Students\nRequesting Accommodations for Pregnant, Parenting, or Nursing Students\nTo request accommodations or for information on reserving a lactation room, please fill out the\u00a0SSU Nursing Mothers Accommodation Request Form.\nQuestions on accommodations for pregnant, parenting, or nursing students can be directed to:\nOffice for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD)ophd@sonoma.edu\nJulie\u00a0Vivas\nTitle IX Officer and Senior Director\u00a0\nOffice for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination\n(707) 664-2480\nEmployees who are Pregnant or Nursing\nFederal and state law prohibit Sonoma State University from discriminating against pregnant or nursing employees.\u00a0 Sonoma State is required to provide reasonable locations and break time for new parents who breastfeed.\u00a0 Further, we cannot discriminate for employment purposes against pregnant or nursing employees.\u00a0 Here are some online resources for supervisors:\nMap of State Protections for Employees who are Pregnant or Nursing\u00a0\nBreak Time for Mothers\nWorkplace Support in Federal Law for Break Time for Nursing Mothers\u00a0\nPregnancy Discrimination (federal guidance)\nBreak Time for Nursing Mothers under the FLSA\nSummary of additional relevant CA state laws (Source: US Department of Labor):\nThe California Fair Employment and Housing Act\u00a0prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sex, which is explicitly defined to include discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions. This law applies to employers with five or more employees, except religious non-profit organizations. Cal. Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 12926, 12940.\nWomen temporarily disabled by pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition are entitled to unpaid leave for as long as they remain disabled, up to four months. During that period, the employer must continue to provide the employee with the same level of health insurance coverage she received prior to taking leave. This law applies to employers with five or more employees, regardless of the worker's tenure or number of hours worked. Cal. Gov't Code \u00a7 12945(a)(1)-(2).\nEmployers are also required to make reasonable accommodations for employees who have work-related limitations stemming from pregnancy, childbirth or a related condition. This may include temporary transfer to a less strenuous or less hazardous position, if an employee so requests upon the advice of her health care provider. If the employer has a policy or practice of transferring temporarily disabled employees to less strenuous positions for the duration of their disability, the employer must do the same for its pregnant employees. Cal. Gov't Code \u00a7 12945(a)(3).\nEmployers cannot discriminate against women for breastfeeding or breastfeeding-related medical conditions. Cal. Gov't Code \u00a7\u00a7 12926, 12940.\nAn employer must provide reasonable unpaid break time to a woman to express breast milk, unless doing so would seriously disrupt the employer's business. If possible, the break time must occur during the employee's ordinary break time. The employer must make a reasonable effort to provide the mother with a private space close to her work area, other than a bathroom, to express breast milk. Cal. Labor Code \u00a7\u00a7 1030-1033.\nRequesting Accommodations for Pregnant, Parenting, or Nursing Employees\nTo request pregnancy related accommodations for employees and/or explore parental leave, please contact:\n\n\nFaculty Contact\u00a0\nSally Russo\nDirector of Faculty Personnel\nLeave of Absence Requests\n(707) 664-3170\n\n\nEmployee Contact\u00a0\nCeleste McLaughlin\nAccommodations Requests\nWorkers' Compensation, ADA, and Leave Specialist\n\u00a0\n\n\nTo request accommodations or for information on reserving a lactation room, please fill out the SSU Nursing Mothers Accommodation Request Form.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice for the Prevention of Harassment & Discrimination\n\nOPHD Home\nAbout\nPolicies & Definitions\nTraining & Education\nResources\nParenting Rights & Resources\nCompliance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport an Incident \nUse\u00a0the OPHD Online Reporting Form\nOPHD Office\nInternational Hall, 2nd floorophd@sonoma.edu(707) 664-4140Semester\u00a0Hours\nMonday-Friday 8am-5pm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSSU Facebook\nSSU Twitter\nSSU Instagram\nSSU Youtube\nSSU News RSS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1801 East Cotati Ave\nRohnert Park, CA 94928\n707.664.2880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact SSU\nPrivacy Notice\nCalifornia State University\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSafeSSU\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n\nEmergency Information\nJobs\nTitle IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
