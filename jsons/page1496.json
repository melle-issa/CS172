While Peoples shines in performance and writing, Spalding thrives on the debate side of forensics. But both agree the Chico State Speech and Debate Team\u00a0has given them space and opportunities to hone their skills, travel, and form lasting friendships. \u00a0\nAt Chico State, the speech and debate team doubles as a club and a course\u2014it is an instructional related activity (IRA) offered through the communications studies program. The team, which competes in tournaments against other two- and four-year schools, offers competition in cross-examination, team policy debate, and individual events. For its members, it also offers countless benefits outside of tournaments.\nPeoples, a first-year student and communication studies major, said one of his favorite aspects of being on the forensics team is traveling for competitions. Visiting Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego, which rests on a cliff overlooking the ocean, and the team\u2019s recent trip to Japan, are two competitions that stood out.\nThe communal aspect of the team has also allowed Peoples to build his confidence and step out of his comfort zone, he said.\nMarcus Peoples delivers a speech during class rehearsal. \n\u201cIt\u2019s nice knowing that the people who are older than me are also there to help me,\u201d Peoples said. \u201cIt\u2019s really like one big family on the speech and debate team.\u201d\nSpalding, a senior political science major, has been a part of the Chico State team since 2021. Like Peoples, seeing new places and gaining new perspectives are major highlights and key reasons she believes team members form strong friendships.\n\u201cYou start to rely on one another and for support,\u201d she said.\nSpalding got her first taste of speech and debate at Solano Community College. At a tournament, she met Chico State\u2019s former forensics director, who put the University on her radar as a transfer school. Now, as a graduating senior approaching Commencement, she says that enrolling at Chico State was the best decision she could have made.\nOriginally a psychology major, Spalding switched gears after the pandemic left her wanting more face-to-face interactions. She changed her major to political science and found solace in the communal environment speech and debate provided.\n\u201cI want to do constitutional law, which involves a lot of interpretation,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to possibly make a political run in the future, so I feel that all the skills I\u2019ve learned\u2014like research and taking a deep dive on an issue or a concept, while writing speeches\u2014will help me succeed in law school.\u201d\nMarin Spalding during class rehearsal. \nPeoples said he is drawn to writing and performing speeches.\n\u201cPublic speaking is a bit like going on a roller coaster,\u201d Peoples said. \u201cIt\u2019s a thrill. I gotta get everybody\u2019s attention. When I\u2019m speaking about something I\u2019m passionate about, that\u2019s when my personality really comes out.\u201d\nBoth Spalding and Peoples have experience with extemporaneous speech, where speakers are assigned a subject\u2014like the decriminalization of marijuana\u2014and a position. They are then given 30 minutes to research history, differing perspectives, or whatever else may help them defend their position.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of Googling bits and pieces, finding sources, and just grabbing as many things as you can,\u201d Peoples said.\nPeoples is currently working on a speech to share at the team\u2019s annual Speech Night, where team members perform some of their work from the semester with the public. He describes his performance as a poem discussing \u201cBlack speech.\u201d\n\u201cI have six distinct characters,\u201d he said. \u201cYou hear a grandmother talking to her granddaughter about everything, like the past and what\u2019s happening now\u2026Then I\u2019ll eventually go to a protester who is advocating for how their Black speech is being cut off and how they have to speak \u2018white.\u2019 Then finally, I have a guy writing a love story to Black speech, talking about how lovely it is.\u201d\nPeoples describes Black speech as what is more commonly known as slang, but defends that it is a valid form of communication.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not wrong to say specific words or sentences differently, or to pronounce words differently,\u201d he said. \u201cThere could be two different phonetic versions of a word, but they both are the same. They\u2019re both valid.\u201d\nPeoples looks forward to participating in speech and debate next semester to continue improving his public speaking skills and to have more opportunities to share differing perspectives. Spalding is looking more toward the future as she nears graduation.\nThe speech and debate team in rehearsal. \n\u201cI might try to go farther south,\u201d she shares. \u201cThere\u2019s an American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) branch in Southern California in the Los Angeles area. LA is the perfect location for constitutional law as a lot of constitutional lawyers work for organizations such as the ACLU.\u201d\nAs both students move towards different futures, they can both look back on their experience with speech and debate and agree the friendships they built are what stand out most.\u00a0\n\u201cThe friends I made in speech and debate kind of became like a family,\u201d Spalding said. \u201cIf I\u2019m having a tough time, they\u2019re there to help me and pull me out of it. They are people that I want in my life and just want to have them there to cheer me on for whatever I accomplish next.\u201d\n*All photos Matt Bates / University Photographer\n\n\nShare this Article\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\t\tCourtney Coleman\t\t\n\n\n\t\tCourtney Coleman is the Communications Specialist for the College of Communication and Education.
