It also attempts to gauge whether enterprise users have embraced the block editor and what other CMS\u2019s the organization is using in addition to WordPress.\n\u201cThis particular survey is focused on brands that are using WordPress, in any part of their estate,\u201d Big Bite CEO Iain McPherson said. \u201cMaybe it could be a small blog, powering an intranet or a large publishing site. I want to understand why and how they are using WordPress, but then drill down into other valuable metrics such as team size and budgets.\u201d\nThe survey will be used to create a new report that summarizes the findings from enterprise organizations. McPherson said if the report is well received in the WordPress community, his team may continue publishing the State of Enterprise WordPress on an annual basis.\nThe survey most directly applies to the people who are responsible for the enterprise organization\u2019s website, as opposed to the business owners. \n\u201cWe find with companies of these sizes; multiple people are managing their WordPress products,\u201d McPherson said. \u201cAlso, multiple respondents from the same company is totally OK, too.\n\u201cThis is one of a couple of initiatives I am working on to raise the brand awareness of Big Bite, but more importantly, show that WordPress should be considered as an enterprise CMS.\u201d\nAccording to W3Techs, WordPress\u2019 current CMS market share is at 63.3% of all the websites where a CMS can be detected. Enterprise organizations help keep this market growing, so insights about how they are using WordPress and their particular pain points could be helpful in developing solutions that benefit this segment. Data from the survey will be aggregated and anonymized and will not be attributed to the respondent or the organization.\nCategory: NewsShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Mastodon (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Telegram (Opens in new window)Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Like thisLike Loading\u2026\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
