The Block Editor allows developers to rapidly create theme templates, template parts, and all the various elements needed for a modern WordPress theme.\nIf you\u2019re used to developing WordPress themes using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but you don\u2019t know where to start with block themes, this course is for you. We will take you through the elements of a block theme, and show you how to take your existing knowledge of theme development, and apply it to block themes.\n\nThis course is Part 1 of the Developers Guide to Block Themes, which will cover the fundamental aspects of developing a block theme. Once you complete Part 1, we suggest also taking to Part 2, which covers more advanced block theme development topics.\n\nIn this course, you will explore\u2026\n\nThe minimum requirements of a block theme\nThe primary elements of a block theme, and how that differs from a classic theme\nTurning a design into a block theme\nDifferent methods of creating block theme elements in the Site Editor, and then exporting them to theme files\n\n\nIn order to complete the exercises in this course, you will need a local WordPress development environment and a code editor. You will also need to have either WordPress version 6.1 installed, or version 6.0 with the Gutenberg plugin installed and active. You will also need a WordPress.org profile, which you can register for here if you don\u2019t already have one.\n\nReady to get started?
