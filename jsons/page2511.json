He also worked hard in community college on his journey to transfer and get a degree from a four-year university. His plan nearly stalled, though. Without academic counseling and support, he couldn\u2019t pinpoint what coursework was needed to make the move.\nFed up, he got in his car one day, drove down the freeway to Chapman and walked into the Office of Admissions with no appointment but lots of questions. By the time he left, he had a plan and guidance. Before long, he was ready and applied as a transfer student but doubted he\u2019d enroll because of financial need.\nHe needn\u2019t have worried. Along with his acceptance came a scholarship that made his dream of a Chapman education come true. The first-gen college student will always remember the moment he heard the news.\nChapman senior Ricky Franco \u201821 says that without his scholarship, attending Chapman would have been out of his financial reach.\n\u201cI got the chills and I jumped up and down a little,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI just felt so confident knowing that Chapman really had my back.\u201d\nThanks to that scholarship and guidance, Franco \u201921 will soon graduate with a degree in business administration and a minor in leadership studies.\nInvesting in Student Success\nSuch opportunities are possible for thousands of Chapman students thanks to multiple sources of donor support, including the university\u2019s annual Giving Day, on Tuesday, April 27 this year.\nThe 24-hour giving event offers the entire Chapman community an opportunity to come together in support of our students and faculty through a gift to the Chapman Fund. Gifts donated on Giving Day will\u00a0 provide funding for\u00a0 student scholarships and programs throughout the university. Last year\u2019s Giving Day raised more than $1 million because of the generosity of hundreds of alumni, parents, staff, faculty, friends and community members.\nOn April 27th participants can engage with campus leaders on Facebook Live, hear inspiring student stories, and join Chapman virtually as we rise to solve the challenges we face. Now more than ever, the Chapman Fund is proving to be a lifeline for many students and their families that continue to experience pandemic-related hardships even as the crisis begins to ease.\nStudent Needs on the Rise\n\u201cWhile we are all happy to move forward, we cannot forget that there is much work still to be done,\u201d says Chapman President Daniele C. Struppa. \u201cFamilies are still facing the effects of job loss, illness and reduced income, creating a continued need for increased scholarship and financial aid assistance.\u201d\nIn addition to helping with students\u2019 pressing needs for food, books, housing assistance and other necessities, the university is also investing in infrastructure essential to a safe return to in-person instruction. Classroom modifications and reduced occupancy in student housing to support social distancing are just part of that.\nAmong the new operating expenses are:\n\n\u00a0 Masks, personal protection equipment and hand sanitizer\n\u00a0 Continuous disinfection and cleaning of campus facilities\n\u00a0 Testing, temperature screening and contact tracing\n\u00a0 Enhanced mental health and wellness support services\n\nThe new infrastructure is vital to all students and the entire campus community, says Jerry Price, Ph.D., vice president for student affairs and dean of students.\n\u201cWe have encouraged students to think of these not so much as rules but as public health imperatives,\u201d Price says. \u201cIt is a partnership: the students\u2019 role is to respect these imperatives, and ours is to have the resources and infrastructure in place to help them be successful. Together, we can work to create and sustain the Chapman campus experience we value so much.\u201d\nLearn More\nTo keep up with all things Giving Day, from Facebook live activities to Instagram stories, visit givingday.chapman.edu.\n\n\nGiving Day \n\n\n\n\n \n\nDawn Bonker \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFowler School of Law Names Inaugural Wylie A.
