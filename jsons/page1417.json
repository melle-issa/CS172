Thus, 2014/15 tuition fee rates continue to remain at the same level as 2011/12 rates.\nThe CSU makes every effort to keep student costs to a minimum. Fees listed in published schedules or student accounts may need to be increased when public funding is inadequate. Therefore, CSU must reserve the right, even after fees are initially charged or initial fee payments are made, to increase or modify any listed fees. All listed fees, other than mandatory systemwide fees, are subject to change without notice, until the date when instruction for a particular semester or quarter has begun. All CSU listed fees should be regarded as estimates that are subject to change upon approval by the Board of Trustees, the Chancellor, or the Presidents, as appropriate. Changes in mandatory systemwide fees will be made in accordance with the requirements of the Working Families Student Fee Transparency and Accountability Act (Sections 66028 - 66028.6 of the Education Code).\n** 2.2% Campus-based Fees increase in Fall 2014 based on CPI for Greater Bay Area for 2013 calendar year. Methodology for annual adjustment approved by student referendum in April 2001.\nList of Factors for Future Considerations of Fee Changes per\u00a0AB 970 adopted via CSU BOT (pdf)\u00a0resolution 3/20/13.\n$150 per semester increase in Student Union Fee beginning Fall 2013 as a result of approved student fee referendum for new Student Center and approved by President Armi\u00f1ana. Wording in the referendum states that the fee increase would occur no earlier than Fall 2012. Date of implementation of fee has been delayed commensurate with delay in construction and completion of the building. Bond financing for Student Center project approved by CSU BOT 11/16/11.\nPer Executive Order No. 1042, beginning in fall 2010, for each adjustment made by trustee action to the State University Fee for graduate students, an equal adjustment will be made to the graduate professional business Category I fee.\nTerm Tuition Fee used in place of State University Fee following approval at 11/10/10 CSU BOT and guidelines in CSU Executive Order 1054.\nThe applicable per term tuition fee schedules are provided on the Chancellor's Office website.\n\nAdditional Fees:\nNon-residential Tuition Fee (per unit): $372. (See\u00a0admissions/residency\u00a0for determination of residence for nonresident tuition purposes.)\nProfessional Program Fee (MBA) (per unit): $254.
