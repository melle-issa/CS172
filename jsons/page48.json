We take advantage of their fast network and SSD persistent storage for optimal site speed and a high-level of redundancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltrafast server setup\nWe developed a custom implementation of PHP and MySQL for high website performance. Our PHP setup alone significantly cuts the TTFB (time to first byte) and makes your pages load 30% faster on average.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop WordPress speed\nWe continuously work to boost WordPress performance. All sites hosted with us get static and dynamic caching enabled, which alone results in up to 5x faster sites. We also preinstall our SiteGround Optimizer plugin on all instances, which gives you out-of-the-box media and front-end optimizations and environmental control for more performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest technologies integrated\nWe are consistently among the first hosting companies to provide their users access to the latest speed technologies. Our customers do not have to wait in order to take advantage of the newest PHP versions or the most innovative protocols and compression algorithms like Brotli, HTTP/2, TLS 1.3 and OCSP Stapling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy top-rated hosting support\nOur Customer Care team is among the highest-rated support squads online, fast, multi-skilled and helpful.\n\n\n\nAvailable 24/7\nRound-the-clock help center\n\n\nProficient & Friendly\nAlways eager to help\n\n\nExtremely Fast\nQuick pickup & resolution\n\n\n98% Satisfaction\nBased on rated interactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut your site\u2019s safety first\nWith our 24/7 system administration, smart WAF, distributed backups and plenty of extra security features, we support you in keeping your site safe so you don\u2019t lose visitors and credibility.\n\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Success Stories\nCelebrating business owners and freelance professionals on our platform by sharing their stories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Hi there!            \n\n                Still deciding?
