Robert Merton] Rawlins Award, the most prestigious award at Chico State. It was very exciting for me, and I feel very honored. It\u2019s a great step for our program and also for myself\u2014being able to get out of college debt-free. That was one of my goals. And from a professional aspect, I\u2019ve gotten so much recognition. It\u2019s been amazing getting to network with other people just solely on this award.\"\u2014Yanetli Navarro-Hernandez (Senior, Concrete Industry Management)\n            See more impacts of giving.\n        University AdvancementVice President Ahmad BouraKendall Hall, Room 114530-898-3590www.csuchico.edu/advancementSupport Chico StateDepartmentsAdvancement ServicesAlumni &\u00a0Parent EngagementUniversity CommunicationsUniversity DevelopmentUniversity Public EngagementChico Performances(opens in new window)\nWe acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus.
