The undergraduate balances work and school, work, procrastination, and mind blanks.\nTry to stay productive because undergrad is almost over. You\u2019ve almost made it! Wildfires swallow the surrounding communities. Sit and stare at articles for hours without processing a single thing.\nSit bare naked and exposed in front of the laptop screen. There\u2019s nothing to hide but no words to write. Barricaded by the barriers of a traumatized mind.\nWait and worry about those pre-requisites instead.\nLet the pain dissipate gradually.\nGraduate.\nThe virus hits right as the imposter syndrome was starting to subside. Second-semester spirals. Home becomes school becomes work which became a cage as we scramble searching for a separate space.\nThis is grad school\u2014keep up the momentum. You\u2019re a grad student\u2014keep up the momentum. This is grad school? This is your kitchen, your living room, and your cat who won\u2019t stop getting on top of the counter.\nSummer swells with the exhaustion of the last semester and the scattered sentences of a thesis yet to be written. Autumn comes. Those page counts need to be reached soon if those deadlines are to be kept.\nThose deadlines are being pushed back again.\nA flash-fiction collection concept. Pages that seem to add up with every editing attempt. Try to expand on this. Please provide further explanation for your reader. We need more context. More inner dialogue, please.\u00a0\nFluid short fiction flows from the fingertips with ease. A larger commitment comes with wordier literary works. Suddenly the piece has inner faucets that need tending to like those loose ends and pacing problems. You\u2019d better revise any problematic plot holes or faulty character arcs as well.\u00a0\nDiscussion Questions to Consider:\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20031. Who\u2019s the killer of the story?\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20032. Which twists and turns are too trope-thick?\n\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20033. Is this influence-soaked work even yours anymore?\u00a0\u00a0\nPiles of papers containing comments keep the thoughts flowing but at too rampant of a pace. The revision process returns once again. Try to reestablish what the work was hoping to accomplish before being dissected. Is it still the same story? Is it successful? What does successful art look like?\nWait. Worry about what happens after all this and after your defense.\nGet it together and let these extra months be your saving grace.\nGraduate.\n\n\n \nShare this:TwitterFacebookLike this:Like Loading...\n\nRelated\n \n\nMarch 2, 2022watershedcsuc \n\n\nPost navigation\n\u2190 WR Intern Spotlight: A Charge of First-Degree Writing: Almost Objective Notes from a Slush\u00a0Reader WR Intern Spotlight: Confessions of an English Major, or Four Years of English Classes in 750\u00a0Words \u2192\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\n\n\nEnter your comment here...\n\n\n\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\nEmail (required) (Address never made public)\n\n\n\nName (required)\n\n\n\nWebsite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t(\u00a0Log\u00a0Out\u00a0/\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tChange\u00a0)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Facebook account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t(\u00a0Log\u00a0Out\u00a0/\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tChange\u00a0)\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCancel\nConnecting to %s\n\n\n\n\n Notify me of new comments via email.
