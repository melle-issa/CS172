All are open to currently enrolled Sonoma State students.\u00a0\nYou can find and explore a directory of all active Recognized Student Organizations at Sonoma State by clicking on \u201cOrganizations\u201d from the homepage of GetInvolved@SSU.\nIf you don\u2019t see an RSO that fits your specific interests or needs, starting a new club or organization is easy! Please review the following basic requirements for starting the recognition process below:\u00a0\n\nRecruit at least 4 other SSU students (5 total including yourself) that are interested in joining your organization.\n\n\nOnce you have 5 total members, decide who would like to serve as the President and who would like to serve as the Treasurer.\u00a0\n\n\nRecruit a faculty or staff member that is interested in serving as your Advisor.\n\n\nSchedule a meeting with the appropriate Student Involvement Advisor to discuss the next steps of the Recognition Process.\u00a0\n\nThe relationships and experience you gain through your involvement in a Recognized Student Org will have immeasurable impact on your experience at SSU and beyond.

I've made countless connections and friendships, all while growing as a person and having fun! It's a great way to feel connected to the greater school community.\n\n\n\n\n\nKat Ness, Disney Club & Intervarsity\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFAASSU has pushed me to grow both as a person and as a leader. I have been able to explore and appreciate my Filipino heritage and meet so many people with similar experiences and interests along the way. This club has been a huge source of comfort and feels like my home away from home. I am nothing but grateful for all the friends and memories I've made thus far.\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah Alferez, Filipino American Association President\n\n\n\n \n   \n \n\n\nBeing a part of the Disney Club has been one of the highlights of my time at SSU.

I was able to meet with students and professors of the department\u00a0who helped me provide insight into the Geology major. Events hosted by the Geology club presented opportunities that are available\u00a0as a geologist.\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Jones, SSU Geology Club President\n\n\n\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStarting the Anime Club was a pretty cool experience that was a major part of my freshman year.
