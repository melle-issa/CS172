We seek to enroll students who are both academically qualified and demonstrate the potential to contribute to SDSU's diverse community. SDSU Aztecs have a wide variety of backgrounds, interests and passions. Decisions are based on the information you report on your application and the academic qualifications of the applicant pool.Expand AllCollapse AllA\u2013G Requirements\nTo meet minimum admission requirements, you must complete a 15-unit comprehensive pattern of college preparatory courses (known in California as A-G requirements) with grades of C-\u00a0or higher.  You must complete your subject requirements by the end of the spring term before enrolling at SDSU. Review A\u2013G courses.\nBack to TopHigh School GPA\nWe consider the breadth and depth of your academic record, and encourage you to challenge yourself by taking a rigorous curriculum including Advanced Placement (AP), honors, and/or International Baccalaureate (IB) classes. Review CSU Minimum First-Year Eligibility.\nBack to TopPreparation Towards Indicated Area of Study (Major)\nYou must choose a major when you apply to SDSU. All majors are competitive, and every major has more applicants than available spots (impaction). While we look at all of the college-prep coursework you have taken during high school, we also consider your performance and the number of units taken in courses most relevant to predict success in your intended academic discipline.\n\nComputer Science and Engineering Majors: Preference is given to applicants who have taken and earned strong grades in science and mathematics courses.\nDance, Music, and Theatre Arts-Performance: Applicants must successfully pass an audition and meet general admissions requirements for admission to the major and the university.\nNursing: You must earn a B or better grade in high school intermediate algebra, biology, and chemistry with lab courses for consideration. If AP or IB level courses are taken in these areas, you must earn a B or better grade in the course. Preference is given to applicants who have taken and earned strong grades in science and mathematics courses. Review our Bachelor\u2019s of Science in Nursing - Direct Entry web page for more information.\n\nBack to TopAdditional Factors\nSpecial consideration is given to students who have overcome life obstacles, participated in college preparatory programs, and attend high schools within SDSU's local admission area.\nBack to Top\n\nNote: In alignment with the California State University (CSU) system, SDSU no longer uses SAT or ACT exam scores from first-year applicants for determining admission eligibility. If accepted, ACT or SAT test scores can be used as one of the measures to place students in the proper mathematics and/or written communication courses.\n\n\n\n\nBefore You Apply\nPlan ahead and apply early.\nCal State Apply Checklist\n\nBefore you begin your application, have the following items on hand:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nUnofficial transcripts. You'll be asked to enter all courses you've completed, those currently in progress, and any you plan to take. Enter your grades as they appear on your transcript using your school grading scale.\nYour citizenship status.\nCredit card. Application fees are due at the time of submission and are paid by credit card.\nAnnual income. If you are a dependent, then report your parents' income. If you are independent, then report your income.\nYour parents' employment background and two recommendations. This applies only if you are applying to the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP).\n\n\nParent/Guardian Communication\nThe Office of Admissions will communicate information to parents or guardians using the email addresses provided on Cal State Apply if you have granted permission. Parent or guardian email addresses are not updated after the application is submitted.\n\nHow to Apply\n\nUse the CSU common admission application, Cal State Apply, to apply.\nA nonrefundable filing fee of $70 must accompany your application.\nNeed help with the Cal State Apply application? Review the  Cal State Apply Application Guide 2023-24.\n\nAdmission decisions are initially based on self-reported data on the application, so we do not need your transcripts until after you are admitted. You must provide complete and accurate information on your application, such as high school GPA, course titles, and grades. Transcripts will be used to verify your self-reported information and any misreporting will jeopardize your admission status.\nApply to SDSU\n\n\nVideo TutorialsFollow along with these short, topic specific videos to learn how to apply using Cal State Apply.\nCreating Profile, Choosing Campus, and Programs\nPersonal Info Quadrant\nHigh School Attended Coursework Entry\nTesting, A-G Matching\n\nColleges Attended, College Coursework\nSupporting Info, Educational Opportunity Program (EOP)\nProgram Materials, Submitting Application\n\nAFTER YOU APPLY: KEEP YOUR GRADES UP!After the application period ends, we will give special attention to reviewing your application. Admissions decisions are made in the spring. If you are admitted:C- or Higher\n\nCourses you listed on your application as in progress or planned must be completed with grades of C- or higher by the end of the spring 2023 term, or any offer of admission may be withdrawn.\n\nGPA\n\nYou must maintain your reported overall GPA. If you earn a D or F during your senior year or if your GPA drops below what was reported on your application, any offer of admission may be withdrawn.\n\nMisreport\n\n\n\n\nIf you misreported a required course, any offer of admission may be withdrawn.\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication and Admission Statusmy.SDSUAlready Applied?Review Your Next Steps\n\nHousing Requirement\nAll first-year students who graduate from a high school outside of SDSU's local admission area during spring 2023 will be required to live on campus for two years. First year and second year students who live in SDSU campus housing are proven to academically outperform their peers who live off campus. Research shows that the average GPA is 11% higher for residential students and 13% higher for students living in learning communities.\nBecause of this proven success, the Sophomore QUEST program was created, which enables program participants to receive customized career development support; flexible guest, meal, and roommate policies; and enhanced safety and security.\nFor more information about the Sophomore QUEST program and housing information, visit the Housing and Residential Education website.\nReview and become familiar with the First-Year On-Campus Resident Parking Policy.\n\nQuick LinksA\u2013G CoursesAP Test RecordsCal State Apply HelpContact Admissions\n\n\n\n\n\nyoutube\ntwitter\nfacebook\ninstagram\n\n\n\n\n619-594-5200\n               \t\t\t\t\t\t\t5500 Campanile Drive\n               \t\t\t\t\t\t\tSan Diego, CA 92182\n\nMaps\nParking\n\n\n\n\nCampus Directory\nEmployment\nMedia Relations\nCanvas\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Contact\nNetwork Status\nStrategic Plan\nNewsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nDocument Readers\nDigital Privacy Statement\nCampus Safety Reports\nFeedback\n\n\u00a9 2023 San Diego State UniversityAll Rights ReservedLast Updated\nback to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Updated 1/19/23",
