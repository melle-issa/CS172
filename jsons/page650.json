Debbie Dingell (D-Michigan) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan), a first-generation American born to Palestinian immigrants, introduced a resolution in Congress in 2019 to honor\u00a0each April and the contributions of Arab Americans.\n\u201cIt is my hope as a strong and proud Arab American in Congress that our nation can uplift our contributions in the United States by supporting Arab American Heritage Month,\u201d Tlaib said of the resolution (the bill remains pending). In 2021,\u00a0 President Joe Biden recognized April as\u00a0National Arab American Heritage Month.\nThis year, the heritage month celebration coincides with Ramadan, the Islamic lunar holiday where Muslims fast, abstaining from food and water from dawn to sunset, every day for a month (this year, March 23- April 21). Muslims make up a substantial percentage of the Arab population, at 93%,\u00a0but live\u00a0alongside those of Coptic\u00a0Orthodox, Christian and Jewish descent (Pew Research Center).\u00a0We asked CSUN students who identify as Arab American about their Arab culture and influences, and what this month means to them.\n\u00a0\nSafaa Kaddoura, 22, Palestinian American: Born deaf to Palestinian parents, Kaddoura has come to learn the importance of many important Arabic traits and facets \u2014 besides language. She reflected on the way she communicates with her \u201cloud family\u201d and noted that she started speech therapy at a young age. While her family mostly communicates with her through English, that did not stop them from learning the basics of Sign Language. Her English is stronger than her Arabic, Kaddoura said, but she remains \u201cvery proud to be Palestinian.\u201d\nFood is an incredibly important avenue for cultural self-expression, the fourth-year psychology major said.\n\u201cThe food brings me closer to my culture,\u201d Kaddoura said. \u201cI love cooking and expressing myself through food. I can share that with the people I love, and I\u2019m thankful that they embrace the food that I make. It just keeps me so sane.\u201d\n\u00a0\nChristina Dakhil, 21, Syrian American: Dakhil grew up in Porterville,\u00a0a city about two hours north of Northridge. Dakhil, a third-year biology major, said the active Syrian\u00a0community there taught her the importance of unity and finding comfort within a community.\n\u201cMost of my friends are Syrians. However, I do feel [that with] every Middle Eastern that I am introduced to, there\u2019s always that little bond. [I typically won\u2019t lose touch] because we have that unity bond that we were raised with,\u201d she said.\nLike many Arab Americans,\u00a0Dakhil has struggled with representation \u2014 and proper recognition, she said. For example, on most government forms and official paperwork, there\u2019s no accurate ethnic\u00a0category for people who identify as Arab American.\n\u201cI remember on the [U.S.] Census, I put \u2018White\u2019 only because I think there was no other option,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not White. No way \u2014 I didn\u2019t learn how to speak English until I was 10. And you\u2019re making me say I\u2019m White? My dad still doesn\u2019t know how to form a proper sentence [in English], but he\u2019s considered White.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nAngelo Ghatas, 20, Egyptian:\u00a0A third-year psychology major, Ghatas came to the U.S. when he was 10 as a refugee to escape Coptic Christian persecution. As he adjusted and eventually assimilated, he said, he came to find his community in the San Fernando\u00a0Valley.\n\u201cI do feel the most connection to Egyptians, because well, for me, I go to church every Sunday, and so the people that I see there are people I\u2019ve seen every Sunday since I came to America,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cI already feel like we\u2019re a family. Because I played on the basketball team for my church, that definitely strengthened the bond between me and other Egyptians that were my age.\u201d\nAs Coptic Orthodox,\u00a0Ghatas\u00a0observes rituals and traditions such as\u00a0the vegan-based Holy Great Fast, which runs from Feb. 27 to April 15, and allows for preparation for Easter.\nHoliday seasons often reveal interesting crossovers between his religion and the overall Egyptian culture, he said. While Ghatas is not an observer of Ramadan, he mentions positive elements, including the yearly tradition of new Ramadan shows\u00a0premiering.\n\u201cOne of the things I love about Ramadan is the [TV] shows that come out. They\u2019re always really good. That\u2019s one of the things I get excited about. In general, I feel like there\u2019s more unity [during Ramadan]. If you visit the region, you will find more connection than division.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGhazi Kanaan, 21, Palestinian American:\u00a0A third-year engineering management technology major, Kanaan traces his Palestinian roots to Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Alternating\u00a0between visiting\u00a0the two countries and living in America, his Arab roots influenced the choices and connections he made, he said. Before CSUN, he started his higher education journey at Sacramento State University.\n\u201cI like [meeting]\u00a0people with like-minded cultures. So when I went to Sac State and saw this big [Arab] population, a couple of my friends and I [created] the Arab Student Union there, and I served as the president before I transferred down here,\u201d Kanaan said. \u201cThe biggest thing about it to me was just giving all [the students] somewhere that they can come and be together. \u2026 There are a lot of international students living far away from their families and need [a more familiar environment].\u201d\u00a0\nKanaan works in the restaurant industry, and he is a practicing Muslim observing Ramadan this month, despite the challenges of being around food at work.\n\u201cThis is my first Ramadan away from home,\u201d he said. \u201cI do enjoy the month, [and I get to] be in touch with my spiritual side.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSamy Couja, 22, Syrian:\u00a0Couja was born and raised in Syria, until he came to the U.S. when he was 10. The third-year marketing major and self-described ambivert (a person with extroverted and introverted features) still remembers the challenges he faced as a new immigrant.\n\u201cWhen I first moved here, talking to people was difficult, obviously because of the accent and the language barrier. I went to an international school [and] I kind of knew some English, so it [didn\u2019t take as long to assimilate]. Later, I became more confident, and although I like to keep my groups small, I don\u2019t feel like I have an accent or stand out [negatively].\u201d\nHe appreciates both American and Syrian culture, Couja said, reflecting on the kindness of the Syrian people he remembers from childhood.\n\u201cThey are more respectful. They have more discipline,\u201d he said of his fellow Syrians. \u201cThey communicate things easier. They don\u2019t resort to violence instantly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:\n\n\n\nStudying Away \u2013 Get to Know the International and Exchange Student Center\n\n\nNew Tech and a Sense of Community: CSUN\u2019s Assistive Technology Conference Celebrates 38 Years\n\n\nCSUN to host multimedia performance that explores climate change\n\n\nTribal Leader, Philanthropist and Acclaimed Author to Receive Honorary Doctorates from CSUN\n\n\nCSUN Showcase Throws Spotlight on Hollywood\u2019s Future Filmmakers\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\u2190 Cesar Chavez Day: A Day of Service\nAfter 12 Years, Student-Led 3 WINS Fitness Still Inspires Community Health \u2192\n\n\n\n\n Top Stories\n\n\n\nFeatured Tag\n\n\n\n\n\n \u2018Ghosts\u2019 Stories: On a Hit TV Show, CSUN Alum Uses His Voice\non April 26, 2023in Alumni, Arts and Culture\n\n\n Tribal Leader, Philanthropist and Acclaimed Author to Receive Honorary Doctorates from CSUN\non April 25, 2023in Alumni, Community, CSU News, CSUN Events, Education, Faculty and Staff News, Graduation Ceremony, Honors & Awards, Media Releases, University News\n\n\n CSUN Breaks Ground on Autodesk Technology Engagement Center, a Project with National Impact\non April 24, 2023in Donor Profile, Giving\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCSU Resources CSU Leader\nCSYouCSU News\n\nTopicsArts and Culture\nAthletics\nBusiness\nCommunity\nCSU News\nEducation\nFaculty and Staff News\nHealth and Fitness\nMedia Releases\nPolitics and Society\nScience and Technology\n CSUN in the News\n\nCalifornia State University Northridge President Dr. Erika D.
