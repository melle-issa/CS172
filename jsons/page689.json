ANTrepreneur Center.\n\nFocused on the theme of sustainability, UCI students have been busy developing their business ideas for this year\u2019s Hacking Student Success series, hosted by the ANTrepreneur Center.\nStarting with the Sustainability Challenge kickoff event April 17, these eager entrepreneurs met other Anteaters and begin sharing their project ideas. Series participants had until April 21 to declare their teams, who are now working together to bring their ideas to life while competing for over $60,000 in prizes.\n\nThe Sustainability Challenge is the second Hacking Student Success event. It was created by the Office of Data and Information Technology and the ANTrepreneur Center to give students an opportunity to address campus issues that affect their own experiences and the resources to develop with solutions that can make a real impact in their community.\nSustainability was chosen as this year\u2019s theme because of its importance to students, the campus and the community.\n\u201cWe think our students have something to say about this, so let\u2019s give them that opportunity,\u201d says Tom Andriola, UCI\u2019s chief digital officer and vice chancellor of information, data and technology at the kickoff event.\nThe ANTrepreneur Center created five categories to guide student projects: Energy, water, air, liveable spaces and food/waste.\n\u201cThe categories are here to guide and inspire students, but sustainability solutions aren\u2019t confined to these,\u201d says Ryan Foland, director of the ANTrepreneur Center. \u201cAnteaters think outside the box, and this challenge is designed to help give students the resources they need to flex their entrepreneurial skills. I\u2019m excited to see what the students come up with this time around.\u201d\nMichael Houlihan and Bonnie Harvey, the founders of Barefoot Wine, attended the kickoff event as keynote speakers and shared their own unique path to entrepreneurship and success.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important to do the right thing,\u201d says Houlihan, \u201cMore than ever we need solutions that are sustainable and affordable. I\u2019m excited to share my experience with young people who are imagining these new ideas and solutions.\u201d\nHarvey, whose right foot you may recognize as the logo on their classic wine bottles, shares her own thoughts on the definition of sustainability.\n\u201cSustainability is a societal goal that relates to the ability of people to coexist with the Earth,\u201d she says. \u201cNot just on it, but with it.\u201d\nAfter declaring their teams, students will attend a business building workshop from Amazon Web Services and receive training on how to pitch their ideas in a video. After submitting their video pitches, judges will choose the top teams to advance to the in-person semi-finals, at which these teams will give three-minute pitches on their sustainable ideas.\nThe top five of teams will be awarded $5,000 and will go on to continue developing their ideas through the Summer Undergraduate Research Program. They will present their final pitches to the UCI student body in fall 2024. The other 15 teams will receive $1,000 and will compete for a wildcard spot to make it to the finals. The winning team will receive $20,000 launch their project across the campus or in the community.\nAt the kickoff event, Anteater creativity was on full display with many students already suggesting bright ideas.\nFourth-year biological sciences major Farheen Dustagheer is interested in a sustainability project using bidets to help reduce the carbon footprint of toilet paper. Fourth-year business administration student Amanda Zhu\u2019s project will focus on combating food insecurity in a sustainable fashion by encouraging the consumption of insects.\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll be interesting to see the projects for sectors that aren\u2019t really being covered,\u201d says Zhu, \u201cFor now it\u2019s just an idea, but I\u2019m excited to see where this goes.\u201d\nIf you want to learn more about supporting this or other activities at UCI, please visit the Brilliant Future website at\u00a0https://brilliantfuture.uci.edu.
