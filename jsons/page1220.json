Struppa announced the first transformative gift of the campaign.\u00a0\nThe gift \u2013 $5 million from generous, longtime Chapman donors Jim and Kay Burra \u2013 will catalyze innovation at Chapman by creating the Burra School of Accounting and Finance within the Argyros School of Business and Economics.\nCareers in business and finance are expected to grow by 7% over the next decade, with certain roles in the sector projected to increase by more than double the average growth rate for all occupations.\nThere\u2019s a strong need for well-trained professionals in this quickly evolving field, and Chapman University\u2019s newest school will help prepare the next generation of leaders. The new Burra School of Accounting and Finance will equip students with relevant knowledge in the ever-changing industry and allow them to build the skills employers seek.\n\u201cWe are proud to be part of the Chapman Family, and we look forward to supporting the excellence of accounting and finance students and faculty for many years,\u201d the Burras said.\nThe couple has been involved with Chapman for decades. Jim Burra is a member of the Board of Trustees and chairs the investment committee. He served on Chapman\u2019s Board of Governors from 1998-2011, then was elected to the Board of Trustees in April 2011. In addition to chairing the board\u2019s investment committee, he was vice chair of the finance committee.\u00a0\nBurra\u2019s many contributions to the Board of Trustees were enhanced by his leadership roles in several companies. He was CFO of multi-industry public company Intercole, Inc., and most recently he served as president and majority owner of Endural. Kay Burra previously served as co-chair of Chapman Celebrates with Jim and has long been an active force in Women of Chapman, a philanthropy organization dedicated \u201cto a program of service to Chapman University.\u201d\n\u201cThe Burras\u2019 generosity is a leap forward for the Argyros School toward reaching its goal of becoming a top 50 business school, and a big step toward Chapman completing the $500 million fundraising campaign,\u201d Struppa said at the gala.\n\u201cOur donors are at the heart of our progress as a business school,\u201d said Henrik Cronqvist, dean of the Argyros School. \u201cTheir support allows us to create new and innovative programs and strengthen existing ones. The generosity of the Burras will allow us to prepare students for the dynamic fields of accounting and finance.\u201d\nIf a $5 million gift weren\u2019t enough to catalyze the campaign, Chapman already has a series of gifts lined up that will be announced over the coming months.\n\u201cThese gifts will help fuel the public phase of the campaign and lift Chapman\u2019s many strengths to even greater heights,\u201d Struppa said at the gala event.\n\u201cThroughout its more than 160 years, Chapman has continually exceeded expectations \u2013 it\u2019s in our DNA,\u201d Parlow said. \u201cThe success of the silent phase of this campaign is proof that Chapman\u2019s ambitions are never too high, and we are grateful to our friends and donors, whose vision and generosity propel Chapman\u2019s ascent as a nationally prominent university.\u201d\n\n\naccounting Argyros School Argyros School of Business and Economics Burra Executive Professor of Accounting Chapman Celebrates comprehensive campaign finance Jim Burra \n\n\n\n\n \n\nJoy Juedes \n\n\nView all posts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Drives Those Who Explore at the Cutting Edge of Discovery?\n\n\n\n\n\nCurtain Down on Chapman Celebrates, Curtain Up on $500 Million Campaign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Asia-Pacific Initiative Offers Unique Take on Hotbed Region Growing up in Los Angeles, Robert Koepp became fascinated with Asia.
