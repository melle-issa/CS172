One way we do this is by assisting the campus community to ensure their information and communication technology is interoperable, usable and accessible, so that individual learning and processing styles and/or physical characteristics are not barriers to access.The role of the UDC is to help CSUN implement business practices which enable the campus to meet policy standards under the Accessible Technology Initiative Coded Memoranda.\u00a0Shared Campus ResponsibilityWhat does this mean to me?Everyone has a part in creating accessible and usable information. The responsibility of creating and maintaining accessible content falls to the entire campus community.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n Universal Design Center\nUniversity Library Room 34, Garden Level\nOffice: (818) 677-5898Fax: (818) 677-4434\n \n\nMail Drop: 8235 18111 Nordhoff Street  University Library Room 34 Northridge, CA 91330-8235\nUDC Directory\n\n\n\n\nLearn About...\n\n\nAdding Alt Text to Images \n\nMaking Captions \n\nTesting Websites for Accessibility \n\nMaking Accessible Flyers \n\nPDF Accessibility \n\nMaking Accessible Forms and Surveys \n\nCanvas Ally  \n\nPurchasing Accessible Technology  \n\nTraining Videos and Resources \n\n\n\nCampus Resources\n\n\nDisability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) \n\nEquity & Diversity \n\nFaculty Technology Center (FTC) \n\nFinancial Services: Procurement & Payments \n\nLearning Resource Center (LRC) \n\nNCOD: Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services \n\nUniversity Library \n\nTseng College: Distance Learning \n\nUniversity Advancement: Marketing & Communications \n\nVISCOM \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 Document Accessibility for Student Employees Training\n\u00a0\n\n\nUDC Scheduled Training's\n\u00a0\nComing soon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              Universal Design Center\n            \u00a9 California State University, Northridge\n    \n18111 Nordhoff Street, Northridge, CA 91330\nPhone: (818) 677-1200\n    /\n    Contact Us\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nPage Feedback\nEmergency Information\nUniversity Policies & Procedures\n\n\n        Title IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms and Conditions for Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDocument Reader\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia State University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
