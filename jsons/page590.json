application opened\u00a0on Wednesday, February 1, 2023 at 12 noon PST in the Housing Portal.\u00a0\u00a0\nFirst year students are\u00a0assigned to Coyote Village; returning (continuing) and transfer students can choose either Arrowhead Village or University Village!\u00a0 We encourage students to apply early as on-campus housing assignments are made based on application submission date and space availability!\nEarly application rates are available to those who apply by 11:59 pm\u00a0PST on Monday, May 1, 2023!\n\n\nApplication

Living\u00a0\nStudents recognize us for convenience, beyond just proximity to classes. We have made renting easier by creating one-bill to include room rent, utilities (electricity, water, heat, A/C, garbage and recycling), Wi-Fi, community and study spaces, academic support, and free\u00a0social events.\nMeaningful Connections\u00a0\nResearch shows\u00a0that students who live on campus have stronger connections with faculty, better relationships with their peers, and participate in more student activities.\nGraduation Goals\u00a0\nStudents who live on campus have higher graduation rates and graduate faster than those who live off campus.\nSafe and Healthy Environment \nOur residents' health and safety in University housing and around campus is important to us.\u00a0 All of our Villages are locked 24 hours a day and require card access.\u00a0 Housing and Residential Education, in coordination with the University Police Department, work to provide a safe and healthy living environment for all our residents.\u00a0 Health\u00a0measures are in place to promote wellness.\nPeace of Mind\u00a0\nThere are no hidden fees or change of contract rates once you move in. If someone moves out of your room or apartment, you will never be obligated to pay their bill; and if you are having issues in your room, our staff can help mediate or find a new space. Additionally, we encourage you to contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships regarding how best to finance living on-campus.\nDining and Healthy Eating\nThe CSUSB dining experience is more than great food.\u00a0 It is a community experience centered around a variety of food choices and healthy options.\u00a0 Coyote Commons offers an array of all-you-care-to-eat selections. Coyote Village\u00a0residents\u00a0are required to choose a meal plan, and returning (continuing) and transfer\u00a0students can purchase a voluntary plan.
